<p>All of them—as they surrender unto Me—I reward accordingly. Everyone follows My
path in all respects, O son of Pṛthā.</p>
<p>PURPORT</p>
<p>Eveyone is searching for Kṛṣṇa in the different aspects of His manifestations.
Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is partially realized in His
impersonal brahmajyoti effulgence and as the all-pervading Supersoul dwelling
within everything, including the particles of atoms. But Kṛṣṇa is only fully
realized by His pure devotees. Consequently, Kṛṣṇa is the object of everyone’s
realization, and thus anyone and everyone is satisfied according to one’s desire
to have Him. In the transcendental world also, Kṛṣṇa reciprocates with His pure
devotees in the transcendental attitude, just as the devotee wants Him. One
devotee may want Kṛṣṇa as supreme master, another as his personal friend,
another as his son, and still another as his lover. Kṛṣṇa rewards all the
devotees equally, according to their different intensities of love for Him. In
the material world, the same reciprocations of feelings are there, and they are
equally exchanged by the Lord with the different types of worshipers. The pure
devotees both here and in the transcendental abode associate with Him in person
and are able to render personal service to the Lord and thus derive
transcendental bliss in His loving service. As for those who are impersonalists
and who want to commit spiritual suicide by annihilating the individual
existence of the living entity, Kṛṣṇa helps also by absorbing them into His
effulgence. Such impersonalists do not agree to accept the eternal, blissful
Personality of Godhead; consequently they cannot relish the bliss of
transcendental personal service to the Lord, having extinguished their
individuality. Some of them, who are not situated even in the impersonal
existence, return to this material field to exhibit their dormant desires for
activities. They are not admitted in the spiritual planets, but they are again
given a chance to act on the material planets. For those who are fruitive
workers, the Lord awards the desired results of their prescribed duties, as the
yajñeśvara; and those who are yogīs seeking mystic powers are awarded such
powers. In other words, everyone is dependant for success upon His mercy alone,
and all kinds of spiritual processes are but different degrees of success on the
same path. Unless, therefore, one comes to the highest perfection of Kṛṣṇa
consciousness, all attempts remain imperfect, as is stated in the Śrīmad
Bhāgavatam:</p>
<p>akāmaḥ sarva-kāmo vā mokṣa-kāma udāradhīḥ tīvreṇa bhakti-yogena yajeta puruṣaṁ
param</p>
<p>“Whether one is without desire [the condition of the devotees], or is desirous
of all fruitive results, or is after liberation, one should with all efforts try
to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead for complete perfection,
culminating in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.” (Bhāg. 2.3.10)</p>

<p>TRANSLATION</p>
<p>Men in this world desire success in fruitive activities, and therefore they
worship the demigods. Quickly, of course, men get results from fruitive work in
this world.</p>
<p>PURPORT</p>
<p>There is a great misconception about the gods or demigods of this material
world, and men of less intelligence, although passing as great scholars, take
these demigods to be various forms of the Supreme Lord. Actually, the demigods
are not different forms of God, but they are God’s different parts and parcels.
God is one, and the parts and parcels are many. The Vedas say, nityo nityānām:
God is one. Īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ. The Supreme God is one—Kṛṣṇa—and the
demigods are delegated with powers to manage this material world. These demigods
are all living entities (nityānām) with different grades of material power. They
cannot be equal to the Supreme God—Nārāyaṇa, Viṣṇu, or Kṛṣṇa. Anyone who thinks
that God and the demigods are on the same level is called an atheist, or
pāṣaṇḍī. Even the great demigods like Brahmā and Śiva cannot be compared to the
Supreme Lord. In fact, the Lord is worshiped by demigods such as Brahmā and Śiva
(śiva-viriñci-nutam). Yet curiously enough there are many human leaders who are
worshiped by foolish men under the misunderstanding of anthropomorphism or
zoomorphism. Iha devatāḥ denotes a powerful man or demigod of this material
world. But Nārāyaṇa, Viṣṇu or Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, does
not belong to this world. He is above, or transcendental to, material creation.
Even Śrīpāda Śaṅkarācārya, the leader of the impersonalists, maintains that
Nārāyaṇa, or Kṛṣṇa, is beyond this material creation. However, foolish people
(hṛt-añjana) worship the demigods because they want immediate results. They get
the results, but do not know that results so obtained are temporary and are
meant for less intelligent persons. The intelligent person is in Kṛṣṇa
consciousness, and he has no need to worship the paltry demigods for some
immediate, temporary benefit. The demigods of this material world, as well as
their worshipers, will vanish with the annihilation of this material world. The
boons of the demigods are material and temporary. Both the material worlds and
their inhabitants, including the demigods, and their worshipers, are bubbles in
the cosmic ocean. In this world, however, human society is mad after temporary
things such as the material opulence of possessing land, family and enjoyable
paraphernalia. To achieve such temporary things, they worship the demigods or
powerful men in human society. If a man gets some ministership in the government
by worshiping a political leader, he considers that he has achieved a great
boon. All of them are therefore kowtowing to the so-called leaders or “big guns”
in order to achieve temporary boons, and they indeed achieve such things. Such
foolish men are not interested in Kṛṣṇa consciousness for the permanent solution
to the hardships of material existence. They are all after sense enjoyment, and
to get a little facility for sense enjoyment they are attracted to worship
empowered living entities known as demigods. This verse indicates that people
are rarely interested in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. They are mostly interested in
material enjoyment, and therefore they worship some powerful living entity.</p>

<p>TRANSLATION</p>
<p>According to the three modes of material nature and the work ascribed to them,
the four divisions of human society were created by Me. And, although I am the
creator of this system, you should know that I am yet the non-doer, being
unchangeable.</p>
<p>PURPORT</p>
<p>The Lord is the creator of everything. Everything is born of Him, everything is
sustained by Him, and everything, after annihilation, rests in Him. He is
therefore the creator of the four divisions of the social order, beginning with
the intelligent class of men, technically called brāhmaṇas due to their being
situated in the mode of goodness. Next is the administrative class, technically
called the kṣatriyas due to their being situated in the mode of passion. The
mercantile men, called the vaiśyas, are situated in the mixed modes of passion
and ignorance, and the śūdras, or laborer class, are situated in the ignorant
mode of material nature. In spite of His creating the four divisions of human
society, Lord Kṛṣṇa does not belong to any of these divisions, because He is not
one of the conditioned souls, a section of whom form human society. Human
society is similar to any other animal society, but to elevate men from the
animal status, the abovementioned divisions are created by the Lord for the
systematic development of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. The tendency of a particular man
toward work is determined by the modes of material nature which he has acquired.
Such symptoms of life, according to different modes of material nature, are
described in the Eighteenth Chapter of this book. A person in Kṛṣṇa
consciousness, however, is above even the brāhmaṇas, because a brāhmaṇa by
quality is supposed to know about Brahman, the Supreme Absolute Truth. Most of
them approach the impersonal Brahman manifestation of Lord Kṛṣṇa, but only a man
who transcends the limited knowledge of a brāhmaṇa and reaches the knowledge of
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, becomes a person in Kṛṣṇa
consciousness—or, in other words, a Vaiṣṇava. Kṛṣṇa consciousness includes
knowledge of all different plenary expansions of Kṛṣṇa, namely Rāma, Nṛsiṁha,
Varāha, etc. However, as Kṛṣṇa is transcendental to this system of the four
divisions of human society, a person in Kṛṣṇa consciousness is also
transcendental to all divisions of human society, whether we consider the
divisions of community, nation or species.</p>

<p>PURPORT</p>
<p>As there are constitutional laws in the material world stating that the king can
do no wrong, or that the king is not subject to the state laws, similarly the
Lord, although He is the creator of this material world, is not affected by the
activities of the material world. He creates and remains aloof from the
creation, whereas the living entities are entangled in the fruitive results of
material activities because of their propensity for lording it over material
resources. The proprietor of an establishment is not responsible for the right
and wrong activities of the workers, but the workers are themselves responsible.
The living entities are engaged in their respective activities of sense
gratification, and these activities are not ordained by the Lord. For
advancement of sense gratification, the living entities are engaged in the work
of this world, and they aspire to heavenly happiness after death. The Lord,
being full in Himself, has no attraction for so-called heavenly happiness. The
heavenly demigods are only His engaged servants. The proprietor never desires
the low-grade happiness such as the workers may desire. He is aloof from the
material actions and reactions. For example, the rains are not responsible for
different types of vegetation that appear on the earth, although without such
rains there is no possibility of vegetative growth. Vedic smṛti confirms this
fact as follows:</p>
<p>nimitta-mātram evāsau sṛjyānāṁ sarga-karmaṇi pradhāna-kāraṇī-bhūtā yato vai
sṛjya-śaktayaḥ.</p>
<p>In the material creations, the Lord is only the supreme cause. The immediate
cause is material nature by which the cosmic manifestation is visible. The
created beings are of many varieties, such as the demigods, human beings and
lower animals, and all of them are subject to the reactions of their past good
or bad activities. The Lord only gives them the proper facilities for such
activities and the regulations of the modes of nature, but He is never
responsible for their past and present activities. In the Vedānta-sūtras it is
confirmed that the Lord is never partial to any living entity. The living entity
is responsible for his own acts. The Lord only gives him facilities, through the
agency of material nature, the external energy. Anyone who is fully conversant
with all the intricacies of this law of karma, or fruitive activities, does not
become affected by the results of his activities. In other words, the person who
understands this transcendental nature of the Lord is an experienced man in
Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and thus he is never subjected to the laws of karma. One
who does not know the transcendental nature of the Lord and who thinks that the
activities of the Lord are aimed at fruitive results, as are the activities of
the ordinary living entities, certainly becomes entangled himself in fruitive
reaction. But one who knows the Supreme Truth is a liberated soul fixed in Kṛṣṇa
consciousness.</p>

<p>TRANSLATION</p>
<p>All the liberated souls in ancient times acted with this understanding and so
attained liberation. Therefore, as the ancients, you should perform your duty in
this divine consciousness.</p>
<p>PURPORT</p>
<p>There are two classes of men. Some of them are full of polluted material things
within their hearts, and some of them are materially free. Kṛṣṇa consciousness
is equally beneficial for both of these persons. Those who are full of dirty
things can take to the line of Kṛṣṇa consciousness for a gradual cleansing
process, following the regulative principles of devotional service. Those who
are already cleansed of the impurities may continue to act in the same Kṛṣṇa
consciousness so that others may follow their exemplary activities and thereby
be benefitted. Foolish persons or neophytes in Kṛṣṇa consciousness often want to
retire from activities without having knowledge of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Arjuna’s
desire to retire from activities on the battlefield was not approved by the
Lord. One need only know how to act. To retire from the activities of Kṛṣṇa
consciousness and to sit aloof making a show of Kṛṣṇa consciousness; is less
important than actually engaging in the field of activities for the sake of
Kṛṣṇa. Arjuna is here advised to act in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, following in the
footsteps of the Lord’s previous disciples, such as the sun-god Vivasvān, as
mentioned hereinbefore. The Supreme Lord knows all His past activities, as well
as those of persons who acted in Kṛṣṇa consciousness in the past. Therefore He
recommends the acts of the sun-god, who learned this art from the Lord some
millions of years before. All such students of Lord Kṛṣṇa are mentioned here as
past liberated persons, engaged in the discharge of duties allotted by Kṛṣṇa.</p></div>
