<p>TRANSLATION</p>
<p>Nor do we know which is better—conquering them or being conquered by them. The
sons of Dhṛtarāṣṭra, whom if we killed we should not care to live, are now
standing before us on this battlefield.</p>
<p>PURPORT</p>
<p>Arjuna did not know whether he should fight and risk unnecessary violence,
although fighting is the duty of the kṣatriyas, or whether he should refrain and
live by begging. If he did not conquer the enemy, begging would be his only
means of subsistence. Nor was there certainty of victory, because either side
might emerge victorious. Even if victory awaited them (and their cause was
justified), still, if the sons of Dhṛtarāṣṭra died in battle, it would be very
difficult to live in their absence. Under the circumstances, that would be
another kind of defeat for them. All these considerations by Arjuna definitely
prove that he was not only a great devotee of the Lord but that he was also
highly enlightened and had complete control over his mind and senses. His desire
to live by begging, although he was born in the royal household, is another sign
of detachment. He was truly virtuous, as these qualities, combined with his
faith in the words of instruction of Śrī Kṛṣṇa (his spiritual master), indicate.
It is concluded that Arjuna was quite fit for liberation. Unless the senses are
controlled, there is no chance of elevation to the platform of knowledge, and
without knowledge and devotion there is no chance of liberation. Arjuna was
competent in all these attributes, over and above his enormous attributes in his
material relationships.</p>

<p>PURPORT</p>
<p>By nature’s own way the complete system of material activities is a source of
perplexity for everyone. In every step there is perplexity, and therefore it
behooves one to approach a bona fide spiritual master who can give one proper
guidance for executing the purpose of life. All Vedic literatures advise us to
approach a bona fide spiritual master to get free from the perplexities of life
which happen without our desire. They are like a forest fire that somehow blazes
without being set by anyone. Similarly, the world situation is such that
perplexities of life automatically appear, without our wanting such confusion.
No one wants fire, and yet it takes place, and we become perplexed. The Vedic
wisdom therefore advises that in order to solve the perplexities of life and to
understand the science of the solution, one must approach a spiritual master who
is in the disciplic succession. A person with a bona fide spiritual master is
supposed to know everything. One should not, therefore, remain in material
perplexities but should approach a spiritual master. This is the purport of this
verse.</p>
<p>Who is the man in material perplexities? It is he who does not understand the
problems of life. In the Garga Upaniṣad the perplexed man is described as
follows:</p>
<p>yo vā etad akṣaraṁ gārgy aviditvāsmāl lokāt praiti sa kṛpaṇaḥ</p>
<p>“He is a miserly man who does not solve the problems of life as a human and who
thus quits this world like the cats and dogs, without understanding the science
of self-realization.” This human form of life is a most valuable asset for the
living entity who can ultilize it for solving the problems of life; therefore,
one who does not utilize this opportunity properly is a miser. On the other
hand, there is the brāhmaṇa, or he who is intelligent enough to utilize this
body to solve all the problems of life.</p>
<p>The kṛpaṇas, or miserly persons, waste their time in being overly affectionate
for family, society, country, etc., in the material conception of life. One is
often attached to family life, namely to wife, children and other members, on
the basis of “skin disease.” The kṛpaṇa thinks that he is able to protect his
family members from death; or the kṛpaṇa thinks that his family or society can
save him from the verge of death. Such family attachment can be found even in
the lower animals who take care of children also. Being intelligent, Arjuna
could understand that his affection for family members and his wish to protect
them from death were the causes ot his perplexities. Although he could
understand that his duty to fight was awaiting him, still, on account of miserly
weakness, he could not discharge the duties. He is therefore asking Lord Kṛṣṇa,
the supreme spiritual master, to make a definite solution. He offers himself to
Kṛṣṇa as a disciple. He wants to stop friendly talks. Talks between the master
and the disciple are serious, and now Arjuna wants to talk very seriously before
the recognized spiritual master. Kṛṣṇa is therefore the original spiritual
master of the science of Bhagavad-gītā, and Arjuna is the first disciple for
understanding the Gītā. How Arjuna understands the Bhagavad-gītā is stated in
the Gītā itself. And yet foolish mundane scholars explain that one need not
submit to Kṛṣṇa as a person, but to “the unborn within Kṛṣṇa.” There is no
difference between Kṛṣṇa’s within and without. And one who has no sense of this
understanding is the greatest fool in trying to understand Bhagavad-gītā.</p>

<p>I can find no means to drive away this grief which is drying up my senses. I

with sovereignty like the demigods in heaven.</p>
<p>PURPORT</p>
<p>Although Arjuna was putting forward so many arguments based on knowledge of the
principles of religion and moral codes, it appears that he was unable to solve
his real problem without the help of the spiritual master, Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa. He
could understand that his so-called knowledge was useless in driving away his
problems, which were drying up his whole existence; and it was impossible for
him to solve such perplexities without the help of a spiritual master like Lord
Kṛṣṇa. Academic knowledge, scholarship, high position, etc., are all useless in
solving the problems of life; help can only be given by a spiritual master like
Kṛṣṇa. Therefore, the conclusion is that a spiritual master who is one hundred
percent Kṛṣṇa conscious is the bona fide spiritual master, for he can solve the
problems of life. Lord Caitanya said that one who is master in the science of
Kṛṣṇa consciousness, regardless of his social position, is the real spiritual
master.</p>
<p>kibāvipra, kibā nyāsī, śūdra kene naya yei kṛṣṇa-tattva-vettā, sei ‘guru’ haya.</p>
<p>(Caitanya-caritāmṛta, Madhya 8.128)</p>
<p>“It does not matter whether a person is a vipra [learned scholar in Vedic
wisdom] or is born in a lower family, or is in the renounced order of life—if he
is master in the science of Kṛṣṇa, he is the perfect and bona fide spiritual
master.” So without being a master in the science of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, no one
is a bona fide spiritual master. It is also said in Vedic literatures:</p>
<p>ṣaṭ-karma-nipuṇo vipro mantra-tantra-viśāradaḥ avaiṣṇavo gurur na syād vaiṣṇavaḥ
śvapaco guruḥ</p>
<p>“A scholarly brāhmaṇa, expert in all subjects of Vedic knowledge, is unfit to
become a spiritual master without being a Vaiṣṇava, or expert in the science of
Kṛṣṇa consciousness. But a person born in a family of a lower caste can become a
spiritual master if he is a Vaiṣṇava, or Kṛṣṇa conscious.”</p>
<p>The problems of material existence—birth, old age, disease and death—cannot be
counteracted by accumulation of wealth and economic development. In many parts
of the world there are states which are replete with all facilities of life,
which are full of wealth, and economically developed, yet the problems of
material existence are still present. They are seeking peace in different ways,
but they ean achieve real happiness only if they consult Kṛṣṇa, or the
Bhagavad-gītā and Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam—which constitute the science of Kṛṣṇa—or the
bona fide representative of Kṛṣṇa, the man in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</p>
<p>If economic development and material comforts could drive away one’s
lamentations for family, social, national or international inebrieties, then
Arjuna would not have said that even an unrivalled kingdom on earth or supremacy
like that of the demigods in the heavenly planets would not be able to drive
away his lamentations. He sought, therefore, refuge in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and
that is the right path for peace and harmony. Economic development or supremacy
over the world can be finished at any moment by the cataclysms of material
nature. Even elevation into a higher planetary situation, as men are now seeking
a place on the moon planet, can also be finished at one stroke. The
Bhagavad-gītā confirms this: kṣīṇe puṇye martyalokaṁ viśanti “When the results
of pious activities are finished, one falls down again from the peak of
happiness to the lowest status of life.” Many politicians of the world have
fallen down in that way. Such downfalls only constitute more causes for
lamentation.</p>
<p>Therefore, if we want to curb lamentation for good, then we have to take shelter
of Kṛṣṇa, as Arjuna is seeking to do. So Arjuna asked Kṛṣṇa to solve his problem
definitely, and that is the way of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</p>

<p>sañjayaḥ uvāca—Sañjaya said; evam—thus; uktvā—speaking; hṛṣīkeśam—unto Kṛṣṇa,
the master of the senses; guḍākeśaḥ—Arjuna, the master at curbing ignorance;
parantapaḥ—the chastiser of the enemies; na yotsye—I shall not fight; iti—thus;
govindam—unto Kṛṣṇa, the giver of pleasure; uktvā—saying; tūṣṇīm—silent;
babhūva—became; ha—certainly.</p>
<p>TRANSLATION</p>
<p>Sañjaya said: Having spoken thus, Arjuna, chastiser of enemies, told Kṛṣṇa,
“Govinda, I shall not fight,” and fell silent.</p>
<p>PURPORT</p>
<p>Dhṛtarāṣṭra must have been very glad to understand that Arjuna was not going to
fight and was instead leaving the battlefield for the begging profession. But
Sañjaya disappointed him again in relating that Arjuna was competent to kill his
enemies (parantapaḥ). Although Arjuna was for the time being overwhelmed with
false grief due to family affection, he surrendered unto Kṛṣṇa, the supreme
spiritual master, as a disciple. This indicated that he would soon be free from
the false lamentation resulting from family affection and would be enlightened
with perfect knowledge of self-realization, or Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and would
then surely fight. Thus Dhṛtarāṣṭra’s joy would be frustrated, since Arjuna
would be enlightened. by Kṛṣṇa and would fight to the end.</p>

<p>tam uvāca hṛṣīkeśaḥ prahasann iva bhārata senayor ubhayor madhye viṣīdantam idaṁ
vacaḥ</p>
<p>tam—unto him; uvāca—said; hṛṣīkeśaḥ—the master of the senses, Kṛṣṇa;
prahasan—smiling; iva—like that; bhārata—O Dhṛtarāṣṭra, descendant of Bharata;
senayoḥ—of the armies; ubhayoḥ—of both parties; madhye—between; viṣīdantam—unto
the lamenting one; idam—the following; vacaḥ—words.</p>
<p>TRANSLATION</p>
<p>O descendant of Bharata, at that time Kṛṣṇa, smiling, in the midst of both the
armies, spoke the following words to the grief-stricken Arjuna.</p>
<p>PURPORT</p>
<p>The talk was going on between intimate friends, namely the Hṛṣīkeśa and the
Guḍākeśa. As friends, both of them were on the same level, but one of them
voluntarily became a student of the other. Kṛṣṇa was smiling because a friend
had chosen to become a disciple. As Lord of all, He is always in the superior
position as the master of everyone, and yet the Lord accepts one who wishes to
be a friend, a son, a lover or a devotee, or who wants Him in such a role. But
when He was accepted as the master, He at once assumed the role and talked with
the disciple like the master—with gravity, as it is required. It appears that
the talk between the master and the disciple was openly exchanged in the
presence of both armies so that all were benefitted. So the talks of
Bhagavad-gītā are not for any particular person, society, or community, but they
are for all, and friends or enemies are equally entitled to hear them.</p>
