<p>English), but almost all of them are not according to authorized disciplic
succession. There are innumerable interpretations rendered by different mundane
scholars, but almost all of them do not accept the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, although they make a good business on the words of Śrī Kṛṣṇa.
This spirit is demonic, because demons do not believe in God but simply enjoy
the property of the Supreme. Since there is a great need of an edition of the
Gītā in English, as it is received by the paramparā (disciplic succession)
system, an attempt is made herewith to fulfill this great want.
Bhagavad-gītā—accepted as it is—is a great boon to humanity; but if it is
accepted as a treatise of philosophical speculations, it is simply a waste of
time.</p>

<p>That very ancient science of the relationship with the Supreme is today told by
Me to you because you are My devotee as well as My friend; therefore you can

<p>PURPORT</p>
<p>There are two classes of men, namely the devotee and the demon. The Lord
selected Arjuna as the recipient of this great science owing to his becoming the
devotee of the Lord, but for the demon it is not possible to understand this
great mysterious science. There are a number of editions of this great book of
knowledge, and some of them have commentaries by the devotees, and some of them
have commentaries by the demons. Commentation by the devotees is real, whereas
that of the demons is useless. Arjuna accepts Śrī Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, and any commentary on the Gītā following in the
footsteps of Arjuna is real devotional service to the cause of this great
science. The demonic, however, concoct something about Kṛṣṇa and mislead the
public and general readers from the path of Kṛṣṇa’s instructions. One should try
to follow the disciplic succession from Arjuna, and thus be benefitted.</p>

<p>TRANSLATION</p>
<p>Arjuna said: The sun-god Vivasvān is senior by birth to You. How am I to
understand that in the beginning You instructed this science to him?</p>
<p>PURPORT</p>
<p>Arjuna is an accepted devotee of the Lord, so how could he not believe Kṛṣṇa’s
words? The fact is that Arjuna is not inquiring for himself but for those who do
not believe in the Supreme Personality of Godhead or for the demons who do not
like the idea that Kṛṣṇa should be accepted as the Supreme Personality of
Godhead; for them only Arjuna inquires on this point, as if he were himself not
aware of the Personality of Godhead, or Kṛṣṇa. As it will be evident from the
Tenth Chapter, Arjuna knew perfectly well that Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality
of Godhead, the fountainhead of everything and the last word in Transcendence.
Of course, Kṛṣṇa also appeared as the son of Devakī on this earth. How Kṛṣṇa
remained the same Supreme Personality of Godhead, the eternal, original person,
is very difficult for an ordinary man to understand. Therefore, to clarify this
point, Arjuna put this question before Kṛṣṇa so that He Himself could speak
authoritatively. That Kṛṣṇa is the supreme authority is accepted by the whole
world, not only at present, but from time immemorial, and the demons alone
reject Him. Anyway, since Kṛṣṇa is the authority accepted by all, Arjuna put
this question before Him in order that Kṛṣṇa would describe Himself without
being depicted by the demons who always try to distort Him in a way
understandable to the demons and their followers. It is necessary that everyone,
for his own interest, know the science of Kṛṣṇa. Therefore, when Kṛṣṇa Himself
speaks about Himself, it is auspicious for all the worlds. To the demons, such
explanations by Kṛṣṇa Himself may appear to be strange because the demons always
study Kṛṣṇa from their own standpoint, but those who are devotees heartily
welcome the statements of Kṛṣṇa when they are spoken by Kṛṣṇa Himself. The
devotees will always worship such authoritative statements of Kṛṣṇa because they
are always eager to know more and more about Him. The atheists, who consider
Kṛṣṇa an ordinary man, may in this way come to know that Kṛṣṇa is superhuman,
that He is sac-cid-ānanda-vigraha—the eternal form of bliss and knowledge—that
He is transcendental, and that He is above the domination of the modes of
material nature and above the influence of time and space. A devotee of Kṛṣṇa’s,
like Arjuna, is undoubtedly above any misunderstanding of the transcendental
position of Kṛṣṇa. Arjuna’s putting this question before the Lord is simply an
attempt by the devotee to defy the atheistic attitude of persons who consider
Kṛṣṇa to be an ordinary human being subject to the modes of material nature.</p>

<p>The Blessed Lord said: Many, many births both you and I have passed. I can

<p>PURPORT</p>
<p>In the Brahma-saṁhitā we have information of many, many incarnations of the
Lord. lt is stated there:</p>
<p>advaitam acyutam anādim ananta-rūpam ādyaṁ purāṇa-puruṣaṁ nava-yauvanaṁ ca
vedeṣu durllabham adurllabham ātma-bhaktau govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ
bhajāmi.</p>
<p>(Bs. 5.33)</p>
<p>“I worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda [Kṛṣṇa], who is the
original person—absolute, infallible, without beginning, although expanded into
unlimited forms, still the same original, the oldest, and the person always
appearing as a fresh youth. Such eternal, blissful, all-knowing forms of the
Lord are usually understood by the best Vedic scholars, but they are always
manifest to pure, unalloyed devotees.” It is also stated in Brahma-saṁhitā:</p>
<p>rāmādi mūrttiṣu kalā-niyamena tiṣṭhan nānāvatāram akarod bhuvaneṣu kintu kṛṣṇaḥ
svayaṁ samabhavat paramaḥ pumān yo govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi</p>
<p>(Bs. 5.39)</p>
<p>“I worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda [Kṛṣṇa], who is always
situated in various incarnations such as Rāma, Nṛsiṁha and many sub-incarnations
as well, but who is the original Personality of Godhead known as Kṛṣṇa, and who
incarnates personally also.”</p>
<p>In the Vedas also it is said that the Lord, although one without a second,
nevertheless manifests Himself in innumerable forms. He is like the vaidurya
stone, which changes color yet still remains one. All those multi-forms are
understood by the pure, unalloyed devotees, but not by a simple study of the
Vedas: vedeṣu durllabham adurllabham ātma-bhaktau. Devotees like Arjuna are
constant companions of the Lord, and whenever the Lord incarnates, the associate
devotees also incarnate in order to serve the Lord in different capacities.
Arjuna is one of these devotees, and in this verse it is understood that some
millions of years ago when Lord Kṛṣṇa spoke the Bhagavad-gītā to the sun-god
Vivasvān, Arjuna, in a different capacity, was also present. But the difference
between the Lord and Arjuna is that the Lord remembered the incidence, whereas
Arjuna could not remember. That is the difference between the part and parcel
living entity and the Supreme Lord. Although Arjuna is addressed herein as the
mighty hero who could subdue the enemies, he is unable to recall what had
happened in his various past births. Therefore, a living entity, however great
he may be in the material estimation, can never equal the Supreme Lord. Anyone
who is a constant companion of the Lord is certainly a liberated person, but he
cannot be equal to the Lord. The Lord is described in the Brahma-saṁhitā as
infallible (acyuta), which means that He never forgets Himself, even though He
is in material contact. Therefore, the Lord and the living entity can never be
equal in all respects, even if the living entity is as liberated as Arjuna.
Although Arjuna is a devotee of the Lord, he sometimes forgets the nature of the
Lord, but by the divine grace a devotee can at once understand the infallible
condition of the Lord, whereas a nondevotee or a demon cannot understand this
transcendental nature. Consequently these descriptions in the Gītā cannot be
understood by demonic brains. Kṛṣṇa remembered acts which were performed by Him
millions of years before, but Arjuna could not, despite the fact that both Kṛṣṇa
and Arjuna are eternal in nature. We may also note herein that a living entity
forgets everything due to his change of body, but the Lord remembers because He
does not change His sac-cid-ānanda body. He is advaita, which means there is no
distinction between His body and Himself. Everything in relation to Him is
spirit—whereas the conditioned soul is different from his material body. And,
because the Lord’s body and self are identical, His position is always different
from the ordinary living entity, even when He descends to the material platform.
The demons cannot adjust themselves to this transcendental nature of the Lord,
as the Lord explains in the following verse.</p>

like an ordinary person, He remembers everything of His many, many past
“births,” whereas a common man cannot remember what he has done even a few hours
before. If someone is asked what he did exactly at the same time one day
earlier, it would be very difficult for a common man to answer immediately. He
would surely have to dredge his memory to recall what he was doing exactly at
the same time one day before. And yet, men often dare claim to be God, or Kṛṣṇa.
One should not be misled by such meaningless claims. Then again, the Lord
explains His prakṛti or His form. Prakṛti means nature as well as svarūpa, or
one’s own form. The Lord says that He appears in His own body. He does not
change His body, as the common living entity changes from one body to another.
The conditioned soul may have one kind of body in the present birth, but he has
a different body in the next birth. In the material world, the living entity has
no fixed body but transmigrates from one body to another. The Lord, however,
does not do so. Whenever He appears, He does so in the same original body, by
His internal potency. In other words, Kṛṣṇa appears in this material world in
His original eternal form, with two hands, holding a flute. He appears exactly
in His eternal body, uncontaminated by this material world. Although He appears
in the same transcendental body and is Lord of the universe, it still appears
that He takes His birth like an ordinary living entity. Despite the fact Lord
Kṛṣṇa grows from childhood to boyhood and from boyhood to youth, astonishingly
enough He never ages beyond youth. At the time of the Battle of Kurukṣetra, He
had many grandchildren at home; or, in other words, He had sufficiently aged by
material calculations. Still He looked just like a young man twenty or
twenty-five years old. We never see a picture of Kṛṣṇa in old age because He
never grows old like us, although He is the oldest person in the whole
creation—past, present, and future. Neither His body nor His intelligence ever
deteriorates or changes. Therefore, it is clear that in spite of His being in
the material world, He is the same unborn, eternal form of bliss and knowledge,
changeless in His transcendental body and intelligence. Factually, His
appearance and disappearance is like the sun’s rising, moving before us, and
then disappearing from our eyesight. When the sun is out of sight, we think that
the sun is set, and when the sun is before our eyes, we think that the sun is on
the horizon. Actually, the sun is always in its fixed position, but owing to our
defective, insufficient senses, we calculate the appearance and disappearance of
the sun in the sky. And, because His appearance and disappearance are completely
different from that of any ordinary, common living entity, it is evident that He
is eternal, blissful knowledge by His internal potency—and He is never
contaminated by material nature. The Vedas also confirm that the Supreme
Personality of Godhead is unborn, yet He still appears to take His birth in
multi-manifestations. The Vedic supplementary literatures also confirm that even
though the Lord appears to be taking His birth, He is still without change of
body. In the Bhāgavatam, He appears before His mother as Nārāyaṇa, with four
hands and the decorations of the six kinds of full opulences. His appearance in
His original eternal form is His causeless mercy, according to the Viśvakośa
dictionary. The Lord is conscious of all of His previous appearances and
disappearances, but a common living entity forgets everything about his past
body as soon as he gets another body. He is the Lord of all living entities
because He performs wonderful and superhuman activities while He is on this
earth. Therefore, the Lord is always the same Absolute Truth and is without
differentiation between His form and self, or between His quality and body. A
question may now be raised as to why the Lord appears and disappears in this
world. This is explained in the next verse.</p>
