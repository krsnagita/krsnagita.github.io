It is the essence of Vedic knowledge\nand one of the most important Upani\u1e63ads in Vedic literature. Of course there are\nmany commentaries in English on the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, and one may question the\nnecessity for another one. This present edition can be explained in the\nfollowing way. Recently an American lady asked me to recommend an English\ntranslation of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Of course in America there are so many editions of\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 available in English, but as far as I have seen, not only in\nAmerica but also in India, none of them can be strictly said to be authoritative\nbecause in almost every one of them the commentator has expressed his own\nopinions without touching the spirit of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 as it is.\n\n\nThe spirit of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is mentioned in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 itself. It is just\nlike this: if we want to take a particular medicine, then we have to follow the\ndirections written on the label. We cannot take the medicine according to our\nown whim or the direction of a friend. It must be taken according to the\ndirections on the label or the directions given by a physician. Similarly,\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 should be taken or accepted as it is directed by the speaker\nhimself. The speaker of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He is mentioned on\nevery page of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Bhagav\u0101n. Of\ncourse the word \u201cbhagav\u0101n\u201d sometimes refers to any powerful person or any\npowerful demigod, and certainly here Bhagav\u0101n designates Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as a\ngreat personality, but at the same time we should know that Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is\nthe Supreme Personality of Godhead, as is confirmed by all great \u0101c\u0101ryas\n(spiritual masters) like \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101c\u0101rya, R\u0101m\u0101nuj\u0101c\u0101rya, Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya, Nimb\u0101rka\nSv\u0101m\u012b, \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu and many other authorities of Vedic knowledge in\nIndia. The Lord Himself also establishes Himself as the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, and He is accepted as such in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101\nand all the Pur\u0101\u1e47as, especially the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, known as the Bh\u0101gavata\nPur\u0101\u1e47a (K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47as tu bhagav\u0101n svayam). Therefore we should take Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 as it\nis directed by the Personality of Godhead Himself.\n\n\nIn the Fourth Chapter of the G\u012bt\u0101 the Lord says:\n\n\n(1) ima\u1e41 vivasvate yoga\u1e41 proktav\u0101n aham avyayam vivasv\u0101n manave pr\u0101ha manur\nik\u1e63v\u0101kave \u2019brav\u012bt\n\n\n(2) eva\u1e41 parampar\u0101-pr\u0101ptam ima\u1e41 r\u0101jar\u1e63ayo vidu\u1e25 sa k\u0101leneha mahat\u0101 yogo na\u1e63\u1e6da\u1e25\nparantapa\n\n\n(3) sa ev\u0101ya\u1e41 may\u0101 te \u2019dya yoga\u1e25 prokta\u1e25 pur\u0101tana\u1e25 bhakto \u2019si me sakh\u0101 ceti\nrahasya\u1e41 hy etad uttamam\n\n\nHere the Lord informs Arjuna that this system of yoga, the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, was\nfirst spoken to the sun-god, and the sun-god explained it to Manu, and Manu\nexplained it to Ik\u1e63v\u0101ku, and in that way, by disciplic succession, one speaker\nafter another, this yoga system has been coming down. But in the course of time\nit has become lost. Consequently the Lord has to speak it again, this time to\nArjuna on the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra.\n\n\nHe tells Arjuna that He is relating this supreme secret to him because he is His\ndevotee and His friend. The purport of this is that Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is a treatise\nwhich is especially meant for the devotee of the Lord. There are three classes\nof transcendentalists, namely the j\u00f1\u0101n\u012b, the yog\u012b and the bhakta, or the\nimpersonalist, the meditator and the devotee. Here the Lord clearly tells Arjuna\nthat He is making him the first receiver of a new parampar\u0101 (disciplic\nsuccession) because the old succession was broken. It was the Lord\u2019s wish,\ntherefore, to establish another parampar\u0101 in the same line of thought that was\ncoming down from the sun-god to others, and it was His wish that His teaching be\ndistributed anew by Arjuna. He wanted Arjuna to become the authority in\nunderstanding the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. So we see that Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is instructed to\nArjuna especially because Arjuna was a devotee of the Lord, a direct student of\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and His intimate friend. Therefore Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is best understood by a\nperson who has qualities similar to Arjuna\u2019s. That is to say he must be a\ndevotee in a direct relationship with the Lord. As soon as one becomes a devotee\nof the Lord, he also has a direct relationship with the Lord. That is a very\nelaborate subject matter, but briefly it can be stated that a devotee is in a\nrelationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead in one of five different\nways:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne may be a devotee in a passive state; \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne may be a devotee in an active state; \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne may be a devotee as a friend; \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne may be a devotee as a parent;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne may be a devotee as a conjugal lover.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArjuna was in a relationship with the Lord as friend. Of course there is a gulf\nof difference between this friendship and the friendship found in the material\nworld. This is transcendental friendship which cannot be had by everyone. Of\ncourse everyone has a particular relationship with the Lord, and that\nrelationship is evoked by the perfection of devotional service. But in the\npresent status of our life, we have not only forgotten the Supreme Lord, but we\nhave forgotten our eternal relationship with the Lord. Every living being, out\nof many, many billions and trillions of living beings, has a particular\nrelationship with the Lord eternally. That is called svar\u016bpa. By the process of\ndevotional service, one can revive that svar\u016bpa, and that stage is called\nsvar\u016bpa-siddhi\u2014perfection of one\u2019s constitutional position. So Arjuna was a\ndevotee, and he was in touch with the Supreme Lord in friendship.\n\n\nHow Arjuna accepted this Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 should be noted. His manner of acceptance\nis given in the Tenth Chapter.\n\n\n(12) arjuna uv\u0101ca para\u1e41 brahma para\u1e41 dh\u0101ma pavitra\u1e41 parama\u1e41 bhav\u0101n puru\u1e63a\u1e41\n\u015b\u0101\u015bvata\u1e41 divyam \u0101di-devam aja\u1e41 vibhum\n\n\n(13) \u0101hus tv\u0101m \u1e5b\u1e63aya\u1e25 sarve devar\u1e63ir n\u0101radas tath\u0101 asito devalo vy\u0101sa\u1e25 svaya\u1e41\ncaiva brav\u012b\u1e63i me\n\n\n(14) sarvam etad \u1e5bta\u1e41 manye yan m\u0101\u1e41 vadasi ke\u015bava na hi te bhagavan vyakti\u1e41\nvidur dev\u0101 na d\u0101nav\u0101\u1e25\n\n\n\u201cArjuna said: You are the Supreme Brahman, the ultimate, the supreme abode and\npurifier, the Absolute Truth and the eternal Divine Person. You are the primal\nGod, transcendental and original, and You are the unborn and all-pervading\nbeauty. All the great sages like N\u0101rada, Asita, Devala, and Vy\u0101sa proclaim this\nof You, and now You Yourself are declaring it to me. O K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, I totally accept\nas truth all that You have told me. Neither the gods nor demons, O Lord, know\nThy personality.\u201d (### . 10. 12\u201314).\n\n\nAfter hearing Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Arjuna\naccepted K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as Para\u1e41 Brahma, the Supreme Brahman. Every living being is\nBrahman, but the supreme living being, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is\nthe Supreme Brahman. Para\u1e41 dh\u0101ma means that He is the supreme rest or abode of\neverything, pavitram means that He is pure, untainted by material contamination,\npuru\u1e63am means that He is the supreme enjoyer, divyam, transcendental, \u0101di-devam,\nthe Supreme Personality of Godhead, ajam, the unborn, and vibhum, the greatest,\nthe all-pervading.\n\n\nNow one may think that because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was the friend of Arjuna, Arjuna was\ntelling Him all this by way of flattery, but Arjuna, just to drive out this kind\nof doubt from the minds of the readers of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, substantiates these\npraises in the next verse when he says that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is accepted as the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead not only by himself but by authorities like the sage\nN\u0101rada, Asita, Devala, Vy\u0101sadeva and so on. These are great personalities who\ndistribute the Vedic knowledge as it is accepted by all \u0101c\u0101ryas. Therefore\nArjuna tells K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a that he accepts whatever He says to be completely perfect.\nSarvam etad \u1e5bta\u1e41 manye: \u201cI accept everything You say to be true.\u201d Arjuna also\nsays that the personality of the Lord is very difficult to understand and that\nHe cannot be known even by the great demigods. This means that the Lord cannot\neven be known by personalities greater than human beings. So how can a human\nbeing understand \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a without becoming His devotee?\n\n\nTherefore Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 should be taken up in a spirit of devotion. One should\nnot think that he is equal to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, nor should he think that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is an\nordinary personality or even a very great personality. Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead, at least theoretically, according to the\nstatements of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 or the statements of Arjuna, the person who is\ntrying to understand the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. We should therefore at least\ntheoretically accept \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and with\nthat submissive spirit we can understand the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Unless one reads the\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 in a submissive spirit, it is very difficult to understand\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 because it is a great mystery.\n\n\nJust what is the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101? The purpose of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is to deliver\nmankind from the nescience of material existence. Every man is in difficulty in\nso many ways, as Arjuna also was in difficulty in having to fight the Battle of\nKuruk\u1e63etra. Arjuna surrendered unto \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and consequently this\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 was spoken. Not only Arjuna, but every one of us is full of\nanxieties because of this material existence. Our very existence is in the\natmosphere of nonexistence. Actually we are not meant to be threatened by\nnonexistence. Our existence is eternal. But somehow or other we are put into\nasat. Asat refers to that which does not exist.\n\n\nOut of so many human beings who are suffering, there are a few who are actually\ninquiring about their position, as to what they are, why they are put into this\nawkward position and so on. Unless one is awakened to this position of\nquestioning his suffering, unless he realizes that he doesn\u2019t want suffering but\nrather wants to make a solution to all sufferings, then one is not to be\nconsidered a perfect human being. Humanity begins when this sort of inquiry is\nawakened in one\u2019s mind. In the Brahma-s\u016btra this inquiry is called\n\u201cbrahma-jij\u00f1\u0101s\u0101.\u201d Every activity of the human being is to be considered a\nfailure unless he inquires about the nature of the Absolute. Therefore those who\nbegin to question why they are suffering or where they came from and where they\nshall go after death are proper students for understanding Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. The\nsincere student should also have a firm respect for the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead. Such a student was Arjuna.\n\n\nLord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a descends specifically to reestablish the real purpose of life when\nman forgets that purpose. Even then, out of many, many human beings who awaken,\nthere may be one who actually enters the spirit of understanding his position,\nand for him this Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is spoken. Actually we are all followed by the\ntiger of nescience, but the Lord is very merciful upon living entities,\nespecially human beings. To this end He spoke the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, making His\nfriend Arjuna His student.\n\n\nBeing an associate of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Arjuna was above all ignorance, but Arjuna was\nput into ignorance on the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra just to question Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nabout the problems of life so that the Lord could explain them for the benefit\nof future generations of human beings and chalk out the plan of life. Then man\ncould act accordingly and perfect the mission of human life.\n\n\nThe subject of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 entails the comprehension of five basic truths.\nFirst of all, the science of God is explained and then the constitutional\nposition of the living entities, j\u012bvas. There is \u012b\u015bvara, which means controller,\nand there are j\u012bvas, the living entities which are controlled. If a living\nentity says that he is not controlled but that he is free, then he is insane.\nThe living being is controlled in every respect, at least in his conditioned\nlife. So in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 the subject matter deals with the \u012b\u015bvara, the\nsupreme controller, and the j\u012bvas, the controlled living entities. Prak\u1e5bti\n(material nature) and time (the duration of existence of the whole universe or\nthe manifestation of material nature) and karma (activity) are also discussed.\nThe cosmic manifestation is full of different activities. All living entities\nare engaged in different activities. From Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 we must learn what God\nis, what the living entities are, what prakrti is, what the cosmic manifestation\nis and how it is controlled by time, and what the activities of the living\nentities are.\n\n\nOut of these five basic subject matters in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 it is established that\nthe Supreme Godhead, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or Brahman, or supreme controller, or\nParam\u0101tm\u0101\u2014you may use whatever name you like\u2014is the greatest of all. The living\nbeings are in quality like the supreme controller. For instance, the Lord has\ncontrol over the universal affairs, over material nature, etc., as will be\nexplained in the later chapters of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Material nature is not\nindependant. She is acting under the directions of the Supreme Lord. As Lord\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says, \u201cPrak\u1e5bti is working under My direction.\u201d When we see wonderful\nthings happening in the cosmic nature, we should know that behind this cosmic\nmanifestation there is a controller. Nothing could be manifested without being\ncontrolled. It is childish not to consider the controller. For instance, a child\nmay think that an automobile is quite wonderful to be able to run without a\nhorse or other animal pulling it, but a sane man knows the nature of the\nautomobile\u2019s engineering arrangement. He always knows that behind the machinery\nthere is a man, a driver. Similarly, the Supreme Lord is a driver under whose\ndirection everything is working. Now the j\u012bvas, or the living entities, have\nbeen accepted by the Lord, as we will note in the later chapters, as His parts\nand parcels. A particle of gold is also gold, a drop of water from the ocean is\nalso salty, and similarly, we the living entities, being part and parcel of the\nsupreme controller, \u012bsvara, or Bhagav\u0101n, Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, have all the qualities\nof the Supreme Lord in minute quantity because we are minute \u012b\u015bvaras,\nsubordinate \u012b\u015bvaras. We are trying to control nature, as presently we are trying\nto control space or planets, and this tendency to control is there because it is\nin K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. But although we have a tendency to lord it over material nature, we\nshould know that we are not the supreme controller. This is explained in\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.\n\n\nWhat is material nature? This is also explained in G\u012bt\u0101 as inferior prak\u1e5bti,\ninferior nature. The living entity is explained as the superior prak\u1e5bti. Prak\u1e5bti\nis always under control, whether inferior or superior. Prak\u1e5bti is female, and\nshe is controlled by the Lord just as the activities of a wife are controlled by\nthe husband. Prak\u1e5bti is always subordinate, predominated by the Lord, who is the\npredominator. The living entities and material nature are both predominated,\ncontrolled by the Supreme Lord. According to the G\u012bt\u0101, the living entities,\nalthough parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord, are to be considered prak\u1e5bti.\nThis is clearly mentioned in the Seventh Chapter, fifth verse of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101:\n\u201cApareyam itas tv any\u0101m.\u201d \u201cThis prak\u1e5bti is My lower nature.\u201d \u201cPrak\u1e5bti\u1e41 viddhi me\npar\u0101m j\u012bva-bh\u016bt\u0101\u1e41 mah\u0101-b\u0101ho yayeda\u1e41 dh\u0101ryate jagat.\u201d And beyond this there is\nanother prak\u1e5bti: j\u012bva-bh\u016bt\u0101m, the living entity.\n\n\nPrak\u1e5bti itself is constituted by three qualities: the mode of goodness, the mode\nof passion and the mode of ignorance. Above these modes there is eternal time,\nand by a combination of these modes of nature and under the control and purview\nof eternal time there are activities which are called karma. These activities\nare being carried out from time immemorial, and we are suffering or enjoying the\nfruits of our activities. For instance, suppose I am a businessman and have\nworked very hard with intelligence and have amassed a great bank balance. Then I\nam an enjoyer. But then say I have lost all my money in business; then I am a\nsufferer. Similarly, in every field of life we enjoy the results of our work, or\nwe suffer the results. This is called karma.\n\n\n\u012a\u015bvara (the Supreme Lord), j\u012bva (the living entity), prak\u1e5bti (nature), eternal\ntime and karma (activity) are all explained in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Out of these\nfive, the Lord, the living entities, material nature and time are eternal. The\nmanifestation of prak\u1e5bti may be temporary, but it is not false. Some\nphilosophers say that the manifestation of material nature is false, but\naccording to the philosophy of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 or according to the philosophy of\nthe Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas, this is not so. The manifestation of the world is not accepted as\nfalse; it is accepted as real, but temporary. It is likened unto a cloud which\nmoves across the sky, or the coming of the rainy season which nourishes grains.\nAs soon as the rainy season is over and as soon as the cloud goes away, all the\ncrops which were nourished by the rain dry up. Similarly, this material\nmanifestation takes place at a certain interval, stays for a while and then\ndisappears. Such are the workings of prak\u1e5bti But this cycle is working\neternally. Therefore prakrti is eternal; it is not false. The Lord refers to\nthis as \u201cMy prak\u1e5bti.\u201d This material nature is the separated energy of the\nSupreme Lord, and similarly the living entities are also the energy of the\nSupreme Lord, but they are not separated. They are eternally related. So the\nLord, the living entity, material nature and time are all interrelated and are\nall eternal. However, the other item, karma, is not eternal. The effects of\nkarma may be very old indeed. We are suffering or enjoying the results of our\nactivities from time immemorial, but we can change the results of our karma, or\nour activity, and this change depends on the perfection of our knowledge. We are\nengaged in various activities. Undoubtedly we do not know what sort of\nactivities we should adopt to gain relief from the actions and reactions of all\nthese activities, but this is also explained in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.\n\n\nThe position of \u012bsvara is that of supreme consciousness. The j\u012bvas, or the\nliving entities, being parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord, are also\nconscious. Both the living entity and material nature are explained as prak\u1e5bti,\nthe energy of the Supreme Lord, but one of the two, the j\u012bva, is conscious. The\nother prak\u1e5bti is not conscious. That is the difference. Therefore the\nj\u012bva-prak\u1e5bti is called superior because the j\u012bva has consciousness which is\nsimilar to the Lord\u2019s. The Lord\u2019s is supreme consciousness, however, and one\nshould not claim that the j\u012bva, the living entity, is also supremely conscious.\nThe living being cannot be supremely conscious at any stage of his perfection,\nand the theory that he can be so is a misleading theory. Conscious he may be,\nbut he is not perfectly or supremely conscious.\n\n\nThe distinction between the j\u012bva and the \u012b\u015bvara will be explained in the\nThirteenth Chapter of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. The Lord is k\u1e63etra-j\u00f1a\u1e25, conscious, as is\nthe living being, but the living being is conscious of his particular body,\nwhereas the Lord is conscious of all bodies. Because He lives in the heart of\nevery living being, He is conscious of the psychic movements of the particular\nj\u012bvas. We should not forget this. It is also explained that the Param\u0101tm\u0101, the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead, is living in everyone\u2019s heart as \u012b\u015bvara, as the\ncontroller, and that He is giving directions for the living entity to act as he\ndesires. The living entity forgets what to do. First of all he makes a\ndetermination to act in a certain way, and then he is entangled in the acts and\nreactions of his own karma. After giving up one type of body, he enters another\ntype of body, as we put on and take off old clothes. As the soul thus migrates,\nhe suffers the actions and reactions of his past activities. These activities\ncan be changed when the living being is in the mode of goodness, in sanity, and\nunderstands what sort of activities he should adopt. If he does so, then all the\nactions and reactions of his past activities can be changed. Consequently, karma\nis not eternal. Therefore we stated that of the five items (\u012b\u015bvara, j\u012bva,\nprak\u1e5bti time and karma) four are eternal, whereas karma is not eternal.\n\n\nThe supreme conscious \u012b\u015bvara is similar to the living entity in this way: both\nthe consciousness of the Lord and that of the living entity are transcendental.\nIt is not that consciousness is generated by the association of matter. That is\na mistaken idea. The theory that consciousness develops under certain\ncircumstances of material combination is not accepted in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.\nConsciousness may be pervertedly reflected by the covering of material\ncircumstances, just as light reflected through colored glass may appear to be a\ncertain color, but the consciousness of the Lord is not materially affected.\nLord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says, \u201cmay\u0101dhyak\u1e63e\u1e47a prak\u1e5bti\u1e25.\u201d When He descends into the material\nuniverse, His consciousness is not materially affected. If He were so affected,\nHe would be unfit to speak on transcendental matters as He does in the\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. One cannot say anything about the transcendental world without\nbeing free from materially contaminated consciousness. So the Lord is not\nmaterially contaminated. Our consciousness, at the present moment, however, is\nmaterially contaminated. The Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 teaches that we have to purify this\nmaterially contaminated consciousness. In pure consciousness, our actions will\nbe dovetailed to the will of \u012b\u015bvara, and that will make us happy. It is not that\nwe have to cease all activities. Rather, our activities are to be purified, and\npurified activities are called bhakti. Activities in bhakti appear to be like\nordinary activities, but they are not contaminated. An ignorant person may see\nthat a devotee is acting or working like an ordinary man, but such a person with\na poor fund of knowledge does not know that the activities of the devotee or of\nthe Lord are not contaminated by impure consciousness or matter. They are\ntranscendental to the three modes of nature. We should know, however, that at\nthis point our consciousness is contaminated.\n\n\nWhen we are materially contaminated, we are called conditioned. False\nconsciousness is exhibited under the impression that I am a product of material\nnature. This is called false ego. One who is absorbed in the thought of bodily\nconceptions cannot understand his situation. Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 was spoken to\nliberate one from the bodily conception of life, and Arjuna put himself in this\nposition in order to receive this information from the Lord. One must become\nfree from the bodily conception of life; that is the preliminary activity for\nthe transcendentalist. One who wants to become free, who wants to become\nliberated, must first of all learn that he is not this material body. Mukti or\nliberation means freedom from material consciousness. In the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam\nalso the definition of liberation is given: Mukti means liberation from the\ncontaminated consciousness of this material world and situation in pure\nconsciousness. All the instructions of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 are intended to awaken this\npure consciousness, and therefore we find at the last stage of the G\u012bt\u0101\u2019s\ninstructions that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is asking Arjuna whether he is now in purified\nconsciousness. Purified consciousness means acting in accordance with the\ninstructions of the Lord. This is the whole sum and substance of purified\nconsciousness. Consciousness is already there because we are part and parcel of\nthe Lord, but for us there is the affinity of being affected by the inferior\nmodes. But the Lord, being the Supreme, is never affected. That is the\ndifference between the Supreme Lord and the conditioned souls.\n\n\nWhat is this consciousness? This consciousness is \u201cI am.\u201d Then what am I? In\ncontaminated consciousness \u201cI am\u201d means \u201cI am the lord of all I survey. I am the\nenjoyer.\u201d The world revolves because every living being thinks that he is the\nlord and creator of the material world. Material consciousness has two psychic\ndivisions. One is that I am the creator, and the other is that I am the enjoyer.\nBut actually the Supreme Lord is both the creator and the enjoyer, and the\nliving entity, being part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, is neither the creator\nnor the enjoyer, but a cooperator. He is the created and the enjoyed. For\ninstance, a part of a machine cooperates with the whole machine; a part of the\nbody cooperates with the whole body. The hands, feet, eyes, legs and so on are\nall parts of the body, but they are not actually the enjoyers. The stomach is\nthe enjoyer. The legs move, the hands supply food, the teeth chew and all parts\nof the body are engaged in satisfying the stomach because the stomach is the\nprincipal factor that nourishes the body\u2019s organization. Therefore everything is\ngiven to the stomach. One nourishes the tree by watering its root, and one\nnourishes the body by feeding the stomach, for if the body is to be kept in a\nhealthy state, then the parts of the body must cooperate to feed the stomach.\nSimilarly, the Supreme Lord is the enjoyer and the creator, and we, as\nsubordinate living beings, are meant to cooperate to satisfy Him. This\ncooperation will actually help us, just as food taken by the stomach will help\nall other parts of the body. If the fingers of the hand think that they should\ntake the food themselves instead of giving it to the stomach, then they will be\nfrustrated. The central figure of creation and of enjoyment is the Supreme Lord,\nand the living entities are cooperators. By cooperation they enjoy. The relation\nis also like that of the master and the servant. If the master is fully\nsatisfied, then the servant is satisfied. Similarly, the Supreme Lord should be\nsatisfied, although the tendency to become the creator and the tendency to enjoy\nthe material world are there also in the living entities because these\ntendencies are there in the Supreme Lord who has created the manifested cosmic\nworld.\n\n\nWe shall find, therefore, in this Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that the complete whole is\ncomprised of the supreme controller, the controlled living entities, the cosmic\nmanifestation, eternal time, and karma, or activities, and all of these are\nexplained in this text. All of these taken completely form the complete whole,\nand the complete whole is called the Supreme Absolute Truth. The complete whole\nand the complete Absolute Truth are the Supreme Personality of Godhead, \u015ar\u012b\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. All manifestations are due to His different energies. He is the complete\nwhole.\n\n\nIt is also explained in the G\u012bt\u0101 that impersonal Brahman is also subordinate to\nthe complete. Brahman is more explicitly explained in the Brahma-s\u016btra to be\nlike the rays of the sunshine. The impersonal Brahman is the shining rays of the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead. Impersonal Brahman is incomplete realization of\nthe absolute whole, and so also is the conception of Param\u0101tm\u0101 in the Twelfth\nChapter. There it shall be seen that the Supreme Personality of Godhead,\nPuru\u1e63ottama, is above both impersonal Brahman and the partial realization of\nParam\u0101tm\u0101. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is called sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha.\nThe Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 begins in this way: \u012b\u015bvara\u1e25 parama\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u1e25\nsac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha\u1e25/ an\u0101dir \u0101dir govinda\u1e25 sarva-k\u0101ra\u1e47a-k\u0101ra\u1e47am. \u201cK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is\nthe cause of all causes. He is the primal cause, and He is the very form of\neternal being, knowledge and bliss.\u201d Impersonal Brahman realization is the\nrealization of His sat (being) feature. Param\u0101tm\u0101 realization is the realization\nof the cit (eternal knowledge) feature. But realization of the Personality of\nGodhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is realization of all the transcendental features: sat, cit and\n\u0101nanda (being, knowledge, bliss) in complete vigraha (form).\n\n\nPeople with less intelligence consider the Supreme Truth to be impersonal, but\nHe is a transcendental person, and this is confirmed in all Vedic literatures.\nNityo nity\u0101n\u0101m cetana\u015b cetan\u0101n\u0101m. As we are all individual living beings and\nhave our individuality, the Supreme Absolute Truth is also, in the ultimate\nissue, a person, and realization of the Personality of Godhead is realization of\nall of the transcendental features. The complete whole is not formless. If He is\nformless, or if He is less than any other thing, then He cannot be the complete\nwhole. The complete whole must have everything within our experience and beyond\nour experience, otherwise it cannot be complete. The complete whole, Personality\nof Godhead, has immense potencies.\n\n\nHow K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is acting in different potencies is also explained in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.\nThis phenomenal world or material world in which we are placed is also complete\nin itself because the twenty-four elements of which this material universe is a\ntemporary manifestation, according to S\u0101\u1e45khya philosophy, are completely\nadjusted to produce complete resources which are necessary for the maintenance\nand subsistence of this universe. There is nothing extraneous; nor is there\nanything needed. This manifestation has its own time fixed by the energy of the\nsupreme whole, and when its time is complete, these temporary manifestations\nwill be annihilated by the complete arrangement of the complete. There is\ncomplete facility for the small complete units, namely the living entities, to\nrealize the complete, and all sorts of incompleteness are experienced due to\nincomplete knowledge of the complete. So Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 contains the complete\nknowledge of Vedic wisdom.\n\n\nAll Vedic knowledge is infallible, and Hindus accept Vedic knowledge to be\ncomplete and infallible. For example, cow dung is the stool of an animal, and\naccording to sm\u1e5bti or Vedic injunction, if one touches the stool of an animal he\nhas to take a bath to purify himself. But in the Vedic scriptures cow dung is\nconsidered to be a purifying agent. One might consider this to be contradictory,\nbut it is accepted because it is Vedic injunction, and indeed by accepting this,\none will not commit a mistake; subsequently it has been proved by modern science\nthat cow dung contains all antiseptic properties. So Vedic knowledge is complete\nbecause it is above all doubts and mistakes, and Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is the essence of\nall Vedic knowledge.\n\n\nVedic knowledge is not a question of research. Our research work is imperfect\nbecause we are researching things with imperfect senses. We have to accept\nperfect knowledge which comes down, as is stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, by the\nparampar\u0101 disciplic succession. We have to receive knowledge from the proper\nsource in disciplic succession beginning with the supreme spiritual master, the\nLord Himself, and handed down to a succession of spiritual masters. Arjuna, the\nstudent who took lessons from Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, accepts everything that He says\nwithout contradicting Him. One is not allowed to accept one portion of\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and not another. No. We must accept Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 without\ninterpretation, without deletion and without our own whimsical participation in\nthe matter. The G\u012bt\u0101 should be taken as the most perfect presentation of Vedic\nknowledge. Vedic knowledge is received from transcendental sources, and the\nfirst words were spoken by the Lord Himself. The words spoken by the Lord are\ndifferent from words spoken by a person of the mundane world who is infected\nwith four defects. A mundaner 1) is sure to commit mistakes, 2) is invariably\nillusioned, 3) has the tendency to cheat others and 4) is limited by imperfect\nsenses. With these four imperfections, one cannot deliver perfect information of\nall-pervading knowledge.\n\n\nVedic knowledge is not imparted by such defective living entities. It was\nimparted unto the heart of Brahm\u0101, the first created living being, and Brahm\u0101 in\nhis turn disseminated this knowledge to his sons and disciples, as he originally\nreceived it from the Lord. The Lord is p\u016br\u1e47am, all-perfect, and there is no\npossibility of His becoming subjected to the laws of material nature. One should\ntherefore be intelligent enough to know that the Lord is the only proprietor of\neverything in the universe and that He is the original creator, the creator of\nBrahm\u0101. In the Eleventh Chapter the Lord is addressed as prapit\u0101maha because\nBrahm\u0101 is addressed as pit\u0101maha, the grandfather, and He is the creator of the\ngrandfather. So no one should claim to be the proprietor of anything; one should\naccept only things which are set aside for him by the Lord as his quota for his\nmaintenance.\n\n\nThere are many examples given of how we are to utilize those things which are\nset aside for us by the Lord. This is also explained in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. In the\nbeginning, Arjuna decided that he should not fight in the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra.\nThis was his own decision. Arjuna told the Lord that it was not possible for him\nto enjoy the kingdom after killing his own kinsmen. This decision was based on\nthe body because he was thinking that the body was himself and that his bodily\nrelations or expansions were his brothers, nephews, brothers-in-law,\ngrandfathers and so on. He was thinking in this way to satisfy his bodily\ndemands. Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 was spoken by the Lord just to change this view, and at\nthe end Arjuna decides to fight under the directions of the Lord when he says,\n\u201ckari\u1e63ye vacana\u1e41 tava.\u201d \u201cI shall act according to Thy word.\u201d\n\n\nIn this world man is not meant to toil like hogs. He must be intelligent to\nrealize the importance of human life and refuse to act like an ordinary animal.\nA human being should realize the aim of his life, and this direction is given in\nall Vedic literatures, and the essence is given in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Vedic\nliterature is meant for human beings, not for animals. Animals can kill other\nliving animals, and there is no question of sin on their part, but if a man\nkills an animal for the satisfaction of his uncontrolled taste, he must be\nresponsible for breaking the laws of nature. In the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 it is clearly\nexplained that there are three kinds of activities according to the different\nmodes of nature: the activities of goodness, of passion and of ignorance.\nSimilarly, there are three kinds of eatables also: eatables in goodness, passion\nand ignorance. All of this is clearly described, and if we properly utilize the\ninstructions of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, then our whole life will become purified, and\nultimately we will be able to reach the destination which is beyond this\nmaterial sky.\n\n\nThat destination is called the san\u0101tana sky, the eternal spiritual sky. In this\nmaterial world we find that everything is temporary. It comes into being, stays\nfor some time, produces some by-products, dwindles and then vanishes. That is\nthe law of the material world, whether we use as an example this body, or a\npiece of fruit or anything. But beyond this temporary world there is another\nworld of which we have information. This world consists of another nature which\nis san\u0101tana, eternal. J\u012bva is also described as san\u0101tana, eternal, and the Lord\nis also described as san\u0101tana in the Eleventh Chapter. We have an intimate\nrelationship with the Lord, and because we are all qualitatively one\u2014the\nsan\u0101tana-dh\u0101ma, or sky, the san\u0101tana Supreme Personality and the san\u0101tana living\nentities\u2014the whole purpose of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is to revive our san\u0101tana\noccupation, or san\u0101tana-dharma, which is the eternal occupation of the living\nentity. We are temporarily engaged in different activities, but all of these\nactivities can be purified when we give up all these temporary activities and\ntake up the activities which are prescribed by the Supreme Lord. That is called\nour pure life.\n\n\nThe Supreme Lord and His transcendental abode are both san\u0101tana, as are the\nliving entities, and the combined association of the Supreme Lord and the living\nentities in the san\u0101tana abode is the perfection of human life. The Lord is very\nkind to the living entities because they are His sons. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a declares in\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, \u201csarva-yoni\u1e63u\u2026aha\u1e41 b\u012bja-prada\u1e25 pit\u0101.\u201d \u201cI am the father of all.\u201d\nOf course there are all types of living entities according to their various\nkarmas, but here the Lord claims that He is the father of all of them. Therefore\nthe Lord descends to reclaim all of these fallen, conditioned souls to call them\nback to the san\u0101tana eternal sky so that the san\u0101tana living entities may regain\ntheir eternal san\u0101tana positions in eternal association with the Lord. The Lord\ncomes Himself in different incarnations, or He sends His confidential servants\nas sons or His associates or \u0101c\u0101ryas to reclaim the conditioned souls.\n\n\nTherefore, san\u0101tana-dharma does not refer to any sectarian process of religion.\nIt is the eternal function of the eternal living entities in relationship with\nthe eternal Supreme Lord. San\u0101tana-dharma refers, as stated previously, to the\neternal occupation of the living entity. R\u0101m\u0101nuj\u0101c\u0101rya has explained the word\nsan\u0101tana as \u201cthat which has neither beginning nor end,\u201d so when we speak of\nsan\u0101tana-dharma, we must take it for granted on the authority of \u015ar\u012b\nR\u0101m\u0101nuj\u0101c\u0101rya that it has neither beginning nor end.\n\n\nThe English word \u201creligion\u201d is a little different from san\u0101tana-dharma. Religion\nconveys the idea of faith, and faith may change. One may have faith in a\nparticular process, and he may change this faith and adopt another, but\nsan\u0101tana-dharma refers to that activity which cannot be changed. For instance,\nliquidity cannot be taken from water, nor can heat be taken from fire.\nSimilarly, the eternal function of the eternal living entity cannot be taken\nfrom the living entity. San\u0101tana-dharma is eternally integral with the living\nentity. When we speak of san\u0101tana-dharma, therefore, we must take it for granted\non the authority of \u015ar\u012b R\u0101m\u0101nuj\u0101c\u0101rya that it has neither beginning nor end.\nThat which has neither end nor beginning must not be sectarian, for it cannot be\nlimited by any boundaries. Yet those belonging to some sectarian faith will\nwrongly consider that san\u0101tana-dharma is also sectarian, but if we go deeply\ninto the matter and consider it in the light of modern science, it is possible\nfor us to see that san\u0101tana-dharma is the business of all the people of the\nworld\u2014nay, of all the living entities of the universe.\n\n\nNon-san\u0101tana religious faith may have some beginning in the annals of human\nhistory, but there is no beginning to the history of san\u0101tana-dharma because it\nremains eternally with the living entities. Insofar as the living entities are\nconcerned, the authoritative \u015b\u0101stras state that the living entity has neither\nbirth nor death. In the G\u012bt\u0101 it is stated that the living entity is never born,\nand he never dies. He is eternal and indestructible, and he continues to live\nafter the destruction of his temporary material body. In reference to the\nconcept of san\u0101tana-dharma, we must try to understand the concept of religion\nfrom the Sanskrit root meaning of the word. Dharma refers to that which is\nconstantly existing with the particular object. We conclude that there is heat\nand light along with the fire; without heat and light, there is no meaning to\nthe word fire. Similarly, we must discover the essential part of the living\nbeing, that part which is his constant companion. That constant companion is his\neternal quality, and that eternal quality is his eternal religion.\n\n\nWhen San\u0101tana Gosv\u0101m\u012b asked \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu about the svar\u016bpa of every\nliving being, the Lord replied that the svar\u016bpa or constitutional position of\nthe living being is the rendering of service to the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead. If we analyze this statement of Lord Caitanya, we can easily see that\nevery living being is constantly engaged in rendering service to another living\nbeing. A living being serves other living beings in two capacities. By doing so,\nthe living entity enjoys life. The lower animals serve human beings as servants\nserve their master. A serves B master, B serves C master and C serves D master\nand so on. Under these circumstances, we can see that one friend serves another\nfriend, the mother serves the son, the wife serves the husband, the husband\nserves the wife and so on. If we go on searching in this spirit, it will be seen\nthat there is no exception in the society of living beings to the activity of\nservice. The politician presents his manifesto for the public to convince them\nof his capacity for service. The voters therefore give the politician their\nvaluable votes, thinking that he will render valuable service to society. The\nshopkeeper serves the customer, and the artisan serves the capitalist. The\ncapitalist serves the family, and the family serves the state in the terms of\nthe eternal capacity of the eternal living being. In this way we can see that no\nliving being is exempt from rendering service to other living beings, and\ntherefore we can safely conclude that service is the constant companion of the\nliving being and that the rendering of service is the eternal religion of the\nliving being.\n\n\nYet man professes to belong to a particular type of faith with reference to\nparticular time and circumstance and thus claims to be a Hindu, Muslim,\nChristian, Buddhist or any other sect. Such designations are\nnon-san\u0101tana-dharma. A Hindu may change his faith to become a Muslim, or a\nMuslim may change his faith to become a Hindu, or a Christian may change his\nfaith and so on. But in all circumstances the change of religious faith does not\neffect the eternal occupation of rendering service to others. The Hindu, Muslim\nor Christian in all circumstances is servant of someone. Thus, to profess a\nparticular type of sect is not to profess one\u2019s san\u0101tana-dharma. The rendering\nof service is san\u0101tana-dharma.\n\n\nFactually we are related to the Supreme Lord in service. The Supreme Lord is the\nsupreme enjoyer, and we living entities are His servitors. We are created for\nHis enjoyment, and if we participate in that eternal enjoyment with the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead, we become happy. We cannot become happy otherwise. It is\nnot possible to be happy independantly, just as no one part of the body can be\nhappy without cooperating with the stomach. It is not possible for the living\nentity to be happy without rendering transcendental loving service unto the\nSupreme Lord.\n\n\nIn the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, worship of different demigods or rendering service to them\nis not approved. It is stated in the Seventh Chapter, twentieth verse:\n\n\nk\u0101mais tais tair h\u1e5bta-j\u00f1\u0101n\u0101\u1e25 prapadyante \u2019nya-devat\u0101\u1e25 ta\u1e41 ta\u1e41 niyamam \u0101sth\u0101ya\nprak\u1e5bty\u0101 niyat\u0101\u1e25 svay\u0101\n\n\n\u201cThose whose minds are distorted by material desires surrender unto demigods and\nfollow the particular rules and regulations of worship according to their own\nnatures.\u201d (### . 7.20) Here it is plainly said that those who are directed by lust\nworship the demigods and not the Supreme Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. When we mention the name\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, we do not refer to any sectarian name. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a means the highest pleasure,\nand it is confirmed that the Supreme Lord is the reservoir or storehouse of all\npleasure. We are all hankering after pleasure. \u0100nandamayo \u2019bhy\u0101s\u0101t. (Vs. 1.1.12)\nThe living entities, like the Lord, are full of consciousness, and they are\nafter happiness. The Lord is perpetually happy, and if the living entities\nassociate with the Lord, cooperate with Him and take part in His association,\nthen they also become happy.\n\n\nThe Lord descends to this mortal world to show His pastimes in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, which\nare full of happiness. When Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, His activities with\nHis cowherd boy friends, with His damsel friends, with the inhabitants of\nV\u1e5bnd\u0101vana and with the cows were all full of happiness. The total population of\nV\u1e5bnd\u0101vana knew nothing but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. But Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a even discouraged His father\nNanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja from worshiping the demigod Indra because He wanted to establish\nthe fact that people need not worship any demigod. They need only worship the\nSupreme Lord because their ultimate goal is to return to His abode.\n\n\nThe abode of Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is described in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, Fifteenth\nChapter, sixth verse:\n\n\nna tad bh\u0101sayate s\u016bryo na \u015ba\u015b\u0101\u1e45ko na p\u0101vaka\u1e25 yad gatv\u0101 na nivartante tad dh\u0101ma\nparama\u1e41 mama\n\n\n\u201cThat abode of Mine is not illumined by the sun or moon, nor by electricity. And\nanyone who reaches it never comes back to this material world.\u201d (### . 15.6)\n\n\nThis verse gives a description of that eternal sky. Of course we have a material\nconception of the sky, and we think of it in relationship to the sun, moon,\nstars and so on, but in this verse the Lord states that in the eternal sky there\nis no need for the sun nor for the moon nor fire of any kind because the\nspiritual sky is already illuminated by the brahmajyoti, the rays emanating from\nthe Supreme Lord. We are trying with difficulty to reach other planets, but it\nis not difficult to understand the abode of the Supreme Lord. This abode is\nreferred to as Goloka. In the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 it is beautifully described: Goloka\neva nivasaty akhil\u0101tma-bh\u016bta\u1e25. The Lord resides eternally in His abode Goloka,\nyet He can be approached from this world, and to this end the Lord comes to\nmanifest His real form, sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha. When He manifests this form,\nthere is no need for our imagining what He looks like. To discourage such\nimaginative speculation, He descends and exhibits Himself as He is, as\n\u015ay\u0101masundara. Unfortunately, the less intelligent deride Him because He comes as\none of us and plays with us as a human being. But because of this we should not\nconsider that the Lord is one of us. It is by His potency that He presents\nHimself in His real form before us and displays His pastimes, which are\nprototypes of those pastimes found in His abode.\n\n\nIn the effulgent rays of the spiritual sky there are innumerable planets\nfloating. The brahmajyoti emanates from the supreme abode, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aloka, and the\n\u0101nandamaya-cinmaya planets, which are not material, float in those rays. The\nLord says, na tad bh\u0101sayate s\u016bryo na \u015ba\u015b\u0101\u1e45ko na p\u0101vaka\u1e25 yad gatv\u0101 na nivartante\ntad dh\u0101ma parama\u1e41 mama. One who can approach that spiritual sky is not required\nto descend again to the material sky. In the material sky, even if we approach\nthe highest planet (Brahmaloka), what to speak of the moon, we will find the\nsame conditions of life, namely birth, death, disease and old age. No planet in\nthe material universe is free from these four principles of material existence.\nTherefore the Lord says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, \u0101brahma-bhuvan\u0101l lok\u0101\u1e25 punar \u0101vartino\n\u2019rjuna. The living entities are traveling from one planet to another, not by\nmechanical arrangement but by a spiritual process. This is also mentioned: y\u0101nti\ndeva-vrat\u0101 dev\u0101n pit\u1e5dn y\u0101nti pit\u1e5b-vrat\u0101\u1e25. No mechanical arrangement is necessary\nif we want interplanetary travel. The G\u012bt\u0101 instructs: y\u0101nti deva-vrat\u0101 dev\u0101n.\nThe moon, the sun and higher planets are called svargaloka. There are three\ndifferent statuses of planets: higher, middle and lower planetary systems. The\nearth belongs to the middle planetary system. Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 informs us how to\ntravel to the higher planetary systems (devaloka) with a very simple formula:\ny\u0101nti deva-vrat\u0101 dev\u0101n. One need only worship the particular demigod of that\nparticular planet and in that way go to the moon, the sun or any of the higher\nplanetary systems.\n\n\nYet Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 does not advise us to go to any of the planets in this\nmaterial world because even if we go to Brahmaloka, the highest planet, through\nsome sort of mechanical contrivance by maybe traveling for forty thousand years\n(and who would live that long?), we will still find the material inconveniences\nof birth, death, disease and old age. But one who wants to approach the supreme\nplanet, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aloka, or any of the other planets within the spiritual sky, will\nnot meet with these material inconveniences. Amongst all of the planets in the\nspiritual sky there is one supreme planet called Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, which is the\noriginal planet in the abode of the original Personality of Godhead \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\nAll of this information is given in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, and we are given through its\ninstruction information how to leave the material world and begin a truly\nblissful life in the spiritual sky.\n\n\nIn the Fifteenth Chapter of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, the real picture of the material\nworld is given. It is said there:\n\n\n\u016brdhva-m\u016blam adha\u1e25-\u015b\u0101kham a\u015bvattha\u1e41 pr\u0101hur avyayam chand\u0101\u1e41si yasya par\u1e47\u0101ni yas\nta\u1e41 veda sa veda-vit\n\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Lord said: There is a banyan tree which has its roots upward and\nits branches down, and the Vedic hymns are its leaves. One who knows this tree\nis the knower of the Vedas.\u201d (### . 15.1) Here the material world is described as\na tree whose roots are upwards and branches are below. We have experience of a\ntree whose roots are upward: if one stands on the bank of a river or any\nreservoir of water, he can see that the trees reflected in the water are upside\ndown. The branches go downward and the roots upward. Similarly, this material\nworld is a reflection of the spiritual world. The material world is but a shadow\nof reality. In the shadow there is no reality or substantiality, but from the\nshadow we can understand that there is substance and reality. In the desert\nthere is no water, but the mirage suggests that there is such a thing as water.\nIn the material world there is no water, there is no happiness, but the real\nwater of actual happiness is there in the spiritual world.\n\n\nThe Lord suggests that we attain the spiritual world in the following manner:\n\n\nnirm\u0101na-moh\u0101 jita-sa\u1e45ga-do\u1e63\u0101 adhy\u0101tma-nity\u0101 viniv\u1e5btta-k\u0101m\u0101\u1e25 dvandvair vimukt\u0101\u1e25\nsukha-du\u1e25kha-sa\u1e41j\u00f1air gacchanty am\u016b\u1e0dh\u0101\u1e25 padam avyaya\u1e41 tat.\n\n\nThat padam avyayam or eternal kingdom can be reached by one who is nirm\u0101na-moha.\nWhat does this mean? We are after designations. Someone wants to become a son,\nsomeone wants to become Lord, someone wants to become the president or a rich\nman or a king or something else. As long as we are attached to these\ndesignations, we are attached to the body because designations belong to the\nbody. But we are not these bodies, and realizing this is the first stage in\nspiritual realization. We are associated with the three modes of material\nnature, but we must become detached through devotional service to the Lord. If\nwe are not attached to devotional service to the Lord, then we cannot become\ndetached from the modes of material nature. Designations and attachments are due\nto our lust and desire, our wanting to lord it over the material nature. As long\nas we do not give up this propensity of lording it over material nature, there\nis no possibility of returning to the kingdom of the Supreme, the\nsan\u0101tana-dh\u0101ma. That eternal kingdom, which is never destroyed, can be\napproached by one who is not bewildered by the attractions of false material\nenjoyments, who is situated in the service of the Supreme Lord. One so situated\ncan easily approach that supreme abode.\n\n\nElsewhere in the G\u012bt\u0101 it is stated:\n\n\navyakto \u2019k\u1e63ara ity uktas tam \u0101hu\u1e25 param\u0101\u1e41 gatim ya\u1e41 pr\u0101pya na nivartante tad\ndh\u0101ma parama\u1e41 mama.\n\n\nAvyakta means unmanifested. Not even all of the material world is manifested\nbefore us. Our senses are so imperfect that we cannot even see all of the stars\nwithin this material universe. In Vedic literature we can receive much\ninformation about all the planets, and we can believe it or not believe it. All\nof the important planets are described in Vedic literatures, especially\n\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, and the spiritual world, which is beyond this material sky,\nis described as avyakta, unmanifested. One should desire and hanker after that\nsupreme kingdom, for when one attains that kingdom, he does not have to return\nto this material world.\n\n\nNext, one may raise the question of how one goes about approaching that abode of\nthe Supreme Lord. Information of this is given in the Eighth Chapter. It is said\nthere:\n\n\nanta-k\u0101le ca m\u0101m eva smaran muktv\u0101 kalevaram ya\u1e25 pray\u0101ti sa mad-bh\u0101vam y\u0101ti\nn\u0101sty atra sa\u1e41\u015baya\u1e25\n\n\n\u201cAnyone who quits his body, at the end of life, remembering Me, attains\nimmediately to My nature; and there is no doubt of this.\u201d (### . 8.5) One who\nthinks of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a at the time of his death goes to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. One must remember the\nform of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; if he quits his body thinking of this form, he approaches the\nspiritual kingdom. Mad-bh\u0101va\u1e41 refers to the supreme nature of the Supreme Being.\nThe Supreme Being is sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha\u2014eternal, full of knowledge and\nbliss. Our present body is not sac-cid-\u0101nanda. It is asat, not sat. It is not\neternal; it is perishable. It is not cit, full of knowledge, but it is full of\nignorance. We have no knowledge of the spiritual kingdom, nor do we even have\nperfect knowledge of this material world where there are so many things unknown\nto us. The body is also nir\u0101nanda; instead of being full of bliss it is full of\nmisery. All of the miseries we experience in the material world arise from the\nbody, but one who leaves this body thinking of the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead at once attains a sac-cid-\u0101nanda body, as is promised in this fifth\nverse of the Eighth Chapter where Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says, \u201cHe attains My nature.\u201d\n\n\nThe process of quitting this body and getting another body in the material world\nis also organized. A man dies after it has been decided what form of body he\nwill have in the next life. Higher authorities, not the living entity himself,\nmake this decision. According to our activities in this life, we either rise or\nsink. This life is a preparation for the next life. If we can prepare,\ntherefore, in this life to get promotion to the kingdom of God, then surely,\nafter quitting this material body, we will attain a spiritual body just like the\nLord.\n\n\nAs explained before, there are different kinds of transcendentalists, the\nbrahmav\u0101di, param\u0101tm\u0101v\u0101di and the devotee, and, as mentioned, in the brahmajyoti\n(spiritual sky) there are innumerable spiritual planets. The number of these\nplanets is far, far greater than all of the planets of this material world. This\nmaterial world has been approximated as only one quarter of the creation. In\nthis material segment there are millions and billions of universes with\ntrillions of planets and suns, stars and moons. But this whole material creation\nis only a fragment of the total creation. Most of the creation is in the\nspiritual sky. One who desires to merge into the existence of the Supreme\nBrahman is at once transferred to the brahmajyoti of the Supreme Lord and thus\nattains the spiritual sky. The devotee, who wants to enjoy the association of\nthe Lord, enters into the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets, which are innumerable, and the\nSupreme Lord by His plenary expansions as N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a with four hands and with\ndifferent names like Pradyumna, Aniruddha, Govinda, etc., associates with him\nthere. Therefore at the end of life the transcendentalists either think of the\nbrahmajyoti, the Param\u0101tm\u0101 or the Supreme Personality of Godhead \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In\nall cases they enter into the spiritual sky, but only the devotee, or he who is\nin personal touch with the Supreme Lord, enters into the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets. The\nLord further adds that of this \u201cthere is no doubt.\u201d This must be believed\nfirmly. We should not reject that which does not tally with our imagination; our\nattitude should be that of Arjuna: \u201cI believe everything that You have said.\u201d\nTherefore when the Lord says that at the time of death whoever thinks of Him as\nBrahman or Param\u0101tm\u0101 or as the Personality of Godhead certainly enters into the\nspiritual sky, there is no doubt about it. There is no question of disbelieving\nit.\n\n\nThe information on how to think of the Supreme Being at the time of death is\nalso given in the G\u012bt\u0101:\n\n\nya\u1e41 ya\u1e41 v\u0101pi smaran bh\u0101va\u1e41 tyajaty ante kalevaram ta\u1e41 tam evaiti kaunteya sad\u0101\ntad-bh\u0101va-bh\u0101vita\u1e25\n\n\n\u201cIn whatever condition one quits his present body, in his next life he will\nattain to that state of being without fail.\u201d (### . 8.6) Material nature is a\ndisplay of one of the energies of the Supreme Lord. In the Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Pur\u0101\u1e47a the\ntotal energies of the Supreme Lord as Vi\u1e63\u1e47u-\u015bakti\u1e25 par\u0101 prokt\u0101, etc., are\ndelineated. The Supreme Lord has diverse and innumerable energies which are\nbeyond our conception; however, great learned sages or liberated souls have\nstudied these energies and have analyzed them into three parts. All of the\nenergies are of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u-\u015bakti, that is to say they are different potencies of Lord\nVi\u1e63\u1e47u. That energy is par\u0101, transcendental. Living entities also belong to the\nsuperior energy, as has already been explained. The other energies, or material\nenergies, are in the mode of ignorance. At the time of death we can either\nremain in the inferior energy of this material world, or we can transfer to the\nenergy of the spiritual world.\n\n\nIn life we are accustomed to thinking either of the material or the spiritual\nenergy. There are so many literatures which fill our thoughts with the material\nenergy\u2014newspapers, novels, etc. Our thinking, which is now absorbed in these\nliteratures, must be transferred to the Vedic literatures. The great sages,\ntherefore, have written so many Vedic literatures such as the Pur\u0101\u1e47as, etc. The\nPur\u0101\u1e47as are not imaginative; they are historical records. In the\nCaitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta there is the following verse:\n\n\nm\u0101y\u0101 mugdha j\u012bver n\u0101hi svata\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-j\u00f1\u0101na j\u012bvera k\u1e5bp\u0101ya kail\u0101 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a veda-pur\u0101\u1e47a\n\n\n(Cc. Madhya 20.122)\n\n\nThe forgetful living entities or conditioned souls have forgotten their\nrelationship with the Supreme Lord, and they are engrossed in thinking of\nmaterial activities. Just to transfer their thinking power to the spiritual sky,\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has given a great number of Vedic literatures. First He divided the Vedas\ninto four, then He explained them in the Pur\u0101\u1e47as, and for less capable people He\nwrote the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata. In the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata there is given the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Then\nall Vedic literature is summarized in the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra, and for future guidance\nHe gave a natural commentation on the Ved\u0101nta-sutra, called \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam.\nWe must always engage our minds in reading these Vedic literatures. Just as\nmaterialists engage their minds in reading newspapers, magazines and so many\nmaterialistic literatures, we must transfer our reading to these literatures\nwhich are given to us by Vy\u0101sadeva; in that way it will be possible for us to\nremember the Supreme Lord at the time of death. That is the only way suggested\nby the Lord, and He guarantees the result: \u201cThere is no doubt.\u201d (### . 8.7)\n\n\ntasm\u0101t sarve\u1e63u k\u0101le\u1e63u m\u0101m anusmara yudhya ca mayy arpita-mano-buddhir m\u0101m\nevai\u1e63yasy asa\u1e41\u015baya\u1e25\n\n\n\u201cTherefore, Arjuna, you should always think of Me, and at the same time you\nshould continue your prescribed duty and fight. With your mind and activities\nalways fixed on Me, and everything engaged in Me, you will attain to Me without\nany doubt.\u201d\n\n\nHe does not advise Arjuna to simply remember Him and give up his occupation. No,\nthe Lord never suggests anything impractical. In this material world, in order\nto maintain the body one has to work. Human society is divided, according to\nwork, into four divisions of social order\u2014br\u0101hma\u1e47a, k\u1e63atriya, vai\u015bya, \u015b\u016bdra. The\nbr\u0101hma\u1e47a class or intelligent class is working in one way, the k\u1e63atriya or\nadministrative class is working in another way, and the mercantile class and the\nlaborers are all tending to their specific duties. In the human society, whether\none is a laborer, merchant, warrior, administrator, or farmer, or even if one\nbelongs to the highest class and is a literary man, a scientist or a theologian,\nhe has to work in order to maintain his existence. The Lord therefore tells\nArjuna that he need not give up his occupation, but while he is engaged in his\noccupation he should remember K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. If he doesn\u2019t practice remembering K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nwhile he is struggling for existence, then it will not be possible for him to\nremember K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a at the time of death. Lord Caitanya also advises this. He says\nthat one should practice remembering the Lord by chanting the names of the Lord\nalways. The names of the Lord and the Lord are nondifferent. So Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s\ninstruction to Arjuna to \u201cremember Me\u201d and Lord Caitanya\u2019s injunction to always\n\u201cchant the names of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u201d are the same instruction. There is no\ndifference, because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s name are nondifferent. In the absolute\nstatus there is no difference between reference and referent. Therefore we have\nto practice remembering the Lord always, twenty-four hours a day, by chanting\nHis names and molding our life\u2019s activities in such a way that we can remember\nHim always.\n\n\nHow is this possible? The \u0101c\u0101ryas give the following example. If a married woman\nis attached to another man, or if a man has an attachment for a woman other than\nhis wife, then the attachment is to be considered very strong. One with such an\nattachment is always thinking of the loved one. The wife who is thinking of her\nlover is always thinking of meeting him, even while she is carrying out her\nhousehold chores. In fact, she carries out her household work even more\ncarefully so her husband will not suspect her attachment. Similarly, we should\nalways remember the supreme lover, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and at the same time perform our\nmaterial duties very nicely. A strong sense of love is required here. If we have\na strong sense of love for the Supreme Lord, then we can discharge our duty and\nat the same time remember Him. But we have to develop that sense of love.\nArjuna, for instance, was always thinking of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; he was the constant\ncompanion of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and at the same time he was a warrior. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a did not advise\nhim to give up fighting and go to the forest to meditate. When Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\ndelineates the yoga system to Arjuna, Arjuna says that the practice of this\nsystem is not possible for him.\n\n\narjuna uv\u0101ca yo \u2019ya\u1e41 yogas tvay\u0101 prokta\u1e25 s\u0101myena madhus\u016bdana etasy\u0101ha\u1e41 na\npa\u015by\u0101mi ca\u00f1calatv\u0101t sthiti\u1e41 sthir\u0101m\n\n\n\u201cArjuna said, O Madhus\u016bdana, the system of yoga which you have summarized\nappears impractical and unendurable to me, for the mind is restless and\nunsteady.\u201d (### . 6.33)\n\n\nBut the Lord says:\n\n\nyogin\u0101m api sarve\u1e63\u0101\u1e41 mad-gaten\u0101ntar\u0101tman\u0101 \u015braddh\u0101v\u0101n bhajate yo m\u0101\u1e41 sa me\nyuktatamo mata\u1e25\n\n\n\u201cOf all yog\u012bs, he who always abides in Me with great faith, worshiping Me in\ntranscendental loving service, is most intimately united with Me in yoga, and is\nthe highest of all.\u201d (### . 6.47) So one who thinks of the Supreme Lord always is\nthe greatest yog\u012b, the supermost j\u00f1\u0101n\u012b, and the greatest devotee at the same\ntime. The Lord further tells Arjuna that as a k\u1e63atriya he cannot give up his\nfighting, but if Arjuna fights remembering K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, then he will be able to\nremember Him at the time of death. But one must be completely surrendered in the\ntranscendental loving service of the Lord.\n\n\nWe work not with our body, actually, but with our mind and intelligence. So if\nthe intelligence and the mind are always engaged in the thought of the Supreme\nLord, then naturally the senses are also engaged in His service. Superficially,\nat least, the activities of the senses remain the same, but the consciousness is\nchanged. The Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 teaches one how to absorb the mind and intelligence\nin the thought of the Lord. Such absorption will enable one to transfer himself\nto the kingdom of the Lord. If the mind is engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s service, then the\nsenses are automatically engaged in His service. This is the art, and this is\nalso the secret of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101: total absorption in the thought of \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\n\n\nModern man has struggled very hard to reach the moon, but he has not tried very\nhard to elevate himself spiritually. If one has fifty years of life ahead of\nhim, he should engage that brief time in cultivating this practice of\nremembering the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This practice is the devotional\nprocess of:\n\n\n\u015brava\u1e47a\u1e41 k\u012brtana\u1e41 vi\u1e63\u1e47o\u1e25 smara\u1e47a\u1e41 p\u0101da-sevanam arcana\u1e41 vandana\u1e41 d\u0101sya\u1e41 sakhyam\n\u0101tma-nivedanam\n\n\nThese nine processes, of which the easiest is \u015brava\u1e47a\u1e41, hearing Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101\nfrom the realized person, will turn one to the thought of the Supreme Being.\nThis will lead to ni\u015bcala, remembering the Supreme Lord, and will enable one,\nupon leaving the body, to attain a spiritual body which is just fit for\nassociation with the Supreme Lord.\n\n\nThe Lord further says:\n\n\nabhy\u0101sa-yoga-yuktena cetas\u0101 n\u0101nya-g\u0101min\u0101 parama\u1e41 puru\u1e63a\u1e41 divya\u1e41 y\u0101ti\np\u0101rth\u0101nucintayan\n\n\n\u201cBy practicing this remembering, without being deviated, thinking ever of the\nSupreme Godhead, one is sure to achieve the planet of the Divine, the Supreme\nPersonality, O son of Kunt\u012b.\u201d (### . 8.8)\n\n\nThis is not a very difficult process. However, one must learn it from an\nexperienced person, from one who is already in the practice. The mind is always\nflying to this and that, but one must always practice concentrating the mind on\nthe form of the Supreme Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or on the sound of His name. The mind is\nnaturally restless, going hither and thither, but it can rest in the sound\nvibration of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. One must thus meditate on parama\u1e41 puru\u1e63a\u1e41, the Supreme\nPerson; and thus attain Him. The ways and the means for ultimate realization,\nultimate attainment, are stated in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, and the doors of this\nknowledge are open for everyone. No one is barred out. All classes of men can\napproach the Lord by thinking of Him, for hearing and thinking of Him is\npossible for everyone.\n\n\nThe Lord further says:\n\n\nm\u0101\u1e41 hi p\u0101rtha vyap\u0101\u015britya ye \u2019pi syu\u1e25 p\u0101pa-yonaya\u1e25 striyo vai\u015by\u0101s tath\u0101 \u015b\u016bdr\u0101s\nte \u2019pi y\u0101nti par\u0101\u1e41 gatim\n\n\nki\u1e41 punar br\u0101hma\u1e47\u0101\u1e25 pu\u1e47y\u0101 bhakt\u0101 r\u0101jar\u1e63ayas tath\u0101 anityam asukha\u1e41 lokam ima\u1e41\npr\u0101pya bhajasva m\u0101m\n\n\n\u201cO son of P\u1e5bth\u0101, anyone who will take shelter in Me, whether a woman, or a\nmerchant, or one born in a low family, can yet approach the supreme destination.\nHow much greater then are the br\u0101hma\u1e47as, the righteous, the devotees, and\nsaintly kings! In this miserable world, these are fixed in devotional service to\nthe Lord.\u201d (### . 9.32\u201333)\n\n\nHuman beings even in the lower statuses of life (a merchant, a woman or a\nlaborer) can attain the Supreme. One does not need highly developed\nintelligence. The point is that anyone who accepts the principle of bhakti-yoga\nand accepts the Supreme Lord as the summum bonum of life, as the highest target,\nthe ultimate goal, can approach the Lord in the spiritual sky. If one adopts the\nprinciples enunciated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, he can make his life perfect and make a\nperfect solution to all the problems of life which arise out of the transient\nnature of material existence. This is the sum and substance of the entire\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.\n\n\nIn conclusion, Bhagavad-g\u012bta is a transcendental literature which one should\nread very carefully. It is capable of saving one from all fear.\n\n\nneh\u0101bhikrama-n\u0101\u015bo \u2019sti pratyav\u0101yo na vidyate svalpam apy asya dharmasya tr\u0101yate\nmahato bhay\u0101t\n\n\n\u201cIn this endeavor there is no loss or diminution, and a little advancement on\nthis path can protect one from the most dangerous type of fear.\u201d (### . 2.40) If\none reads Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 sincerely and seriously, then all of the reactions of\nhis past misdeeds will not react upon him. In the last portion of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101,\nLord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a proclaims:\n\n\nsarva-dharm\u0101n parityajya m\u0101m eka\u1e41 \u015bara\u1e47a\u1e41 vraja aha\u1e41 tv\u0101\u1e41 sarva-p\u0101pebhyo\nmok\u1e63ayi\u1e63y\u0101mi m\u0101 \u015buca\u1e25\n\n\n\u201cGive up all varieties of religiousness, and just surrender unto Me; and in\nreturn I shall protect you from all sinful reactions. Therefore, you have\nnothing to fear.\u201d (### . 18.66) Thus the Lord takes all responsibility for one who\nsurrenders unto Him, and He indemnifies all the reactions of sin.\n\n\nOne cleanses himself daily by taking a bath in water, but one who takes his bath\nonly once in the sacred Ganges water of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 cleanses away all the\ndirt of material life. Because Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is spoken by the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead, one need not read any other Vedic literature. One need\nonly attentively and regularly hear and read Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. In the present age,\nmankind is so absorbed with mundane activities that it is not possible to read\nall of the Vedic literatures. But this is not necessary. This one book,\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, will suffice because it is the essence of all Vedic literatures\nand because it is spoken by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is said that\none who drinks the water of the Ganges certainly gets salvation, but what to\nspeak of one who drinks the waters of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101? G\u012bt\u0101 is the very nectar of\nthe Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata spoken by Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Himself, for Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the original Vi\u1e63\u1e47u.\nIt is nectar emanating from the mouth of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and\nthe Ganges is said to be emanating from the lotus feet of the Lord. Of course\nthere is no difference between the mouth and the feet of the Supreme Lord, but\nin our position we can appreciate that the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is even more important\nthan the Ganges.\n\n\nThe Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is just like a cow, and Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who is a cowherd boy, is\nmilking this cow. The milk is the essence of the Vedas, and Arjuna is just like\na calf. The wise men, the great sages and pure devotees, are to drink the\nnectarean milk of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.\n\n\nIn this present day, man is very eager to have one scripture, one God, one\nreligion, and one occupation. So let there be one common scripture for the whole\nworld\u2014Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. And let there be one God only for the whole world\u2014\u015ar\u012b\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. And one mantra only\u2014Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare\nR\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare. And let there be one work only\u2014the\nservice of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\n\n\nTHE DISCIPLIC SUCCESSION\n\n\nEva\u1e41 parampar\u0101-pr\u0101ptam ima\u1e41 r\u0101jar\u1e63ayo vidu\u1e25.

There it says that one should read\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 very scrutinizingly with the help of a person who is a devotee of\n\u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and try to understand it without personally motivated interpretations.\nThe example of clear understanding is there in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 itself, in the\nway the teaching is understood by Arjuna, who heard the G\u012bt\u0101 directly from the\nLord. If someone is fortunate enough to understand Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 in that line of\ndisciplic succession, without motivated interpretation, then he surpasses all\nstudies of Vedic wisdom, and all scriptures of the world. One will find in the\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 all that is contained in other scriptures, but the reader will\nalso find things which are not to be found elsewhere. That is the specific\nstandard of the G\u012bt\u0101. It is the perfect theistic science because it is directly\nspoken by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\n\n\nThe topics discussed by Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra and Sa\u00f1jaya, as described in the\nMah\u0101bh\u0101rata, form the basic principle for this great philosophy. It is\nunderstood that this philosophy evolved on the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra, which\nis a sacred place of pilgrimage from the immemorial time of the Vedic age. It\nwas spoken by the Lord when He was present personally on this planet for the\nguidance of mankind.\n\n\nThe word dharma-k\u1e63etra (a place where religious rituals are performed) is\nsignificant because, on the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra, the Supreme Personality\nof Godhead was present on the side of Arjuna. Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra, the father of the\nKurus, was highly doubtful about the possibility of his sons\u2019 ultimate victory.\nIn his doubt, he inquired from his secretary Sa\u00f1jaya, \u201cWhat did my sons and the\nsons of P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du do?\u201d He was confident that both his sons and the sons of his\nyounger brother P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du were assembled in that Field of Kuruk\u1e63etra for a\ndetermined engagement of the war. Still, his inquiry is significant. He did not\nwant a compromise between the cousins and brothers, and he wanted to be sure of\nthe fate of his sons on the battlefield. Because the battle was arranged to be\nfought at Kuruk\u1e63etra, which is mentioned elsewhere in the Vedas as a place of\nworship\u2014even for the denizens of heaven\u2014Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra became very fearful about\nthe influence of the holy place on the outcome of the battle. He knew very well\nthat this would influence Arjuna and the sons of P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du favorably, because by\nnature they were all virtuous. Sa\u00f1jaya was a student of Vy\u0101sa, and therefore, by\nthe mercy of Vy\u0101sa, Sa\u00f1jaya was able to envision the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra\neven while he was in the room of Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra. And so, Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra asked him\nabout the situation on the battlefield.\n\n\nBoth the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas and the sons of Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra belong to the same family, but\nDh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra\u2019s mind is disclosed herein. He deliberately claimed only his sons as\nKurus, and he separated the sons of P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du from the family heritage. One can thus\nunderstand the specific position of Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra in his relationship with his\nnephews, the sons of P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du. As in the paddy field the unnecessary plants are\ntaken out, so it is expected from the very beginning of these topics that in the\nreligious field of Kuruk\u1e63etra where the father of religion, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, was\npresent, the unwanted plants like Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra\u2019s son Duryodhana and others would\nbe wiped out and the thoroughly religious persons, headed by Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, would\nbe established by the Lord. This is the significance of the words dharma-k\u1e63etre\nand kuru-k\u1e63etre, apart from their historical and Vedic importance.\n\n\n1.2\n\n\nsa\u00f1jaya uv\u0101ca\n\n\nd\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dv\u0101 tu p\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dav\u0101n\u012bka\u1e41\n\n\nvy\u016b\u1e0dha\u1e41 duryodhanas tad\u0101\n\n\n\u0101c\u0101ryam upasa\u1e45gamya\n\n\nr\u0101j\u0101 vacanam abrav\u012bt\n\n\nsa\u00f1jaya\u1e25\u2014Sa\u00f1jaya; uv\u0101ca\u2014said; d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dv\u0101\u2014after seeing; tu\u2014but; p\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dava-an\u012bkam\u2014the\nsoldiers of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas; vy\u016b\u1e0dham\u2014arranged in military phalanx; duryodhana\u1e25\u2014King\nDuryodhana; tad\u0101\u2014at that time; \u0101c\u0101ryam\u2014the teacher; upasa\u1e45gamya\u2014approaching\nnearby; r\u0101j\u0101\u2014the king; vacanam\u2014words; abrav\u012bt\u2014spoke.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nSa\u00f1jaya said: O King, after looking over the army gathered by the sons of P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du,\nKing Duryodhana went to his teacher and began to speak the following words:\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nDh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra was blind from birth. Unfortunately, he was also bereft of spiritual\nvision. He knew very well that his sons were equally blind in the matter of\nreligion, and he was sure that they could never reach an understanding with the\nP\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, who were all pious since birth. Still he was doubtful about the\ninfluence of the place of pilgrimage, and Sa\u00f1jaya could understand his motive in\nasking about the situation on the battlefield. He wanted, therefore, to\nencourage the despondent King, and thus he warned him that his sons were not\ngoing to make any sort of compromise under the influence of the holy place.\nSa\u00f1jaya therefore informed the King that his son, Duryodhana, after seeing the\nmilitary force of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, at once went to the commander-in-chief,\nDro\u1e47\u0101c\u0101rya, to inform him of the real position.

Dro\u1e47\u0101c\u0101rya had some political quarrel with\nKing Drupada, the father of Draupad\u012b, who was Arjuna\u2019s wife.

Dro\u1e47\u0101c\u0101rya\nknew this perfectly well, and yet, as a liberal br\u0101hma\u1e47a, he did not hesitate to\nimpart all his military secrets when the son of Drupada, Dh\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dadyumna, was\nentrusted to him for military education.

Duryodhana\npointed out this mistake of Dro\u1e47\u0101c\u0101rya\u2019s so that he might be alert and\nuncompromising in the fighting. By this he wanted to point out also that he\nshould not be similarly lenient in battle against the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, who were also\nDro\u1e47\u0101c\u0101rya\u2019s affectionate students.

The sounding of the\ntranscendental conchshells indicated that there was no hope of victory for the\nother side because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was on the side of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas.

And whenever and\nwherever the Lord is present, the goddess of fortune is also there because the\ngoddess of fortune never lives alone without her husband. Therefore, victory and\nfortune were awaiting Arjuna, as indicated by the transcendental sound produced\nby the conchshell of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, or Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Besides that, the chariot on which\nboth the friends were seated was donated by Agni (the fire-god) to Arjuna, and\nthis indicated that this chariot was capable of conquering all sides, wherever\nit was drawn over the three worlds.\n\n\n1.15\n\n\np\u0101\u00f1cajanya\u1e41 h\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015bo\n\n\ndevadatta\u1e41 dhana\u00f1jaya\u1e25\n\n\npau\u1e47\u1e0dra\u1e41 dadhmau mah\u0101-\u015ba\u1e45kha\u1e41\n\n\nbh\u012bma-karm\u0101 v\u1e5bkodara\u1e25\n\n\np\u0101\u00f1cajanyam\u2014the conchshell named P\u0101\u00f1cajanya; h\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba\u1e25\u2014H\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba (K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Lord\nwho directs the senses of the devotees); devadattam\u2014the conchshell named\nDevadatta; dhana\u00f1jaya\u1e25\u2014Dhana\u00f1jaya (Arjuna, the winner of wealth); pau\u1e47\u1e0dram\u2014the\nconch named Pau\u1e47\u1e0dram; dadhmau\u2014blew; mah\u0101-\u015ba\u1e45kham\u2014the terrific conchshell;\nbh\u012bma-karm\u0101\u2014one who performs Herculean tasks; v\u1e5bkodara\u1e25\u2014the voracious eater\n(Bh\u012bma).\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThen, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a blew His conchshell, called P\u0101\u00f1cajanya; Arjuna blew his, the\nDevadatta; and Bh\u012bma, the voracious eater and performer of Herculean tasks, blew\nhis terrific conchshell called Pau\u1e47\u1e0dram.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nLord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is referred to as H\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba in this verse because He is the owner of\nall senses. The living entities are part and parcel of Him, and, therefore, the\nsenses of the living entities are also part and parcel of His senses. The\nimpersonalists cannot account for the senses of the living entities, and\ntherefore they are always anxious to describe all living entities as sense-less,\nor impersonal. The Lord, situated in the hearts of all living entities, directs\ntheir senses. But, He directs in terms of the surrender of the living entity,\nand in the case of a pure devotee He directly controls the senses. Here on the\nBattlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra the Lord directly controls the transcendental senses\nof Arjuna, and thus His particular name of H\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba. The Lord has different\nnames according to His different activities. For example, His name is\nMadhus\u016bdana because He killed the demon of the name Madhu; His name is Govinda\nbecause He gives pleasure to the cows and to the senses; His name is V\u0101sudeva\nbecause He appeared as the son of Vasudeva; His name is Devak\u012b-nandana because\nHe accepted Devak\u012b as His mother; His name is Ya\u015bod\u0101-nandana because He awarded\nHis childhood pastimes to Ya\u015bod\u0101 at V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana; His name is P\u0101rtha-s\u0101rathi\nbecause He worked as charioteer of His friend Arjuna. Similarly, His name is\nH\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba because He gave direction to Arjuna on the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra.\n\n\nArjuna is referred to as Dhana\u00f1jaya in this verse because he helped his elder\nbrother in fetching wealth when it was required by the King to make expenditures\nfor different sacrifices. Similarly, Bh\u012bma is known as V\u1e5bkodara because he could\neat as voraciously as he could perform Herculean tasks, such as killing the\ndemon Hi\u1e0dimba. So, the particular types of conchshell blown by the different\npersonalities on the side of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, beginning with the Lord\u2019s, were all\nvery encouraging to the fighting soldiers. On the other side there were no such\ncredits, nor the presence of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the supreme director, nor that of the\ngoddess of fortune. So, they were predestined to lose the battle\u2014and that was\nthe message announced by the sounds of the conchshells.\n\n\n1.16-18\n\n\nanantavijaya\u1e41 r\u0101j\u0101\n\n\nkunt\u012b-putro yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira\u1e25\n\n\nnakula\u1e25 sahadeva\u015b ca\n\n\nsugho\u1e63a-ma\u1e47ipu\u1e63pakau\n\n\nk\u0101\u015bya\u015b ca parame\u1e63v-\u0101sa\u1e25\n\n\n\u015bikha\u1e47\u1e0d\u012b ca mah\u0101-ratha\u1e25\n\n\ndh\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dadyumno vir\u0101\u1e6da\u015b ca\n\n\ns\u0101tyaki\u015b c\u0101par\u0101jita\u1e25\n\n\ndrupado draupadey\u0101\u015b ca\n\n\nsarva\u015ba\u1e25 p\u1e5bthiv\u012b-pate\n\n\nsaubhadra\u015b ca mah\u0101-b\u0101hu\u1e25\n\n\n\u015ba\u1e45kh\u0101n dadhmu\u1e25 p\u1e5bthak p\u1e5bthak\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nKing Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, the son of Kunt\u012b, blew his conchshell, the Anantavijaya, and\nNakula and Sahadeva blew the Sugho\u1e63a and Ma\u1e47ipu\u1e63paka.

The emblem of Hanum\u0101n on the flag\nof Arjuna is another sign of victory because Hanum\u0101n cooperated with Lord R\u0101ma\nin the battle between R\u0101ma and R\u0101va\u1e47a, and Lord R\u0101ma emerged victorious. Now\nboth R\u0101ma and Hanum\u0101n were present on the chariot of Arjuna to help him. Lord\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is R\u0101ma Himself, and wherever Lord R\u0101ma is, His eternal servitor Hanum\u0101n\nand His eternal consort S\u012bt\u0101, the goddess of fortune, are present. Therefore,\nArjuna had no cause to fear any enemies whatsoever. And above all, the Lord of\nthe senses, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, was personally present to give him direction. Thus, all\ngood counsel was available to Arjuna in the matter of executing the battle.

He never fails in His\naffection for His devotees, and thus He is addressed herein as infallible. As\ncharioteer, He had to carry out the orders of Arjuna, and since He did not\nhesitate to do so, He is addressed as infallible. Although He had accepted the\nposition of a charioteer for His devotee, His supreme position was not\nchallenged. In all circumstances, He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead,\nH\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba, the Lord of the total senses. The relationship between the Lord and\nHis servitor is very sweet and transcendental. The servitor is always ready to\nrender a service to the Lord, and, similarly, the Lord is always seeking an\nopportunity to render some service to the devotee. He takes greater pleasure in\nHis pure devotee\u2019s assuming the advantageous postion of ordering Him than He\ndoes in being the giver of orders. As master, everyone is under His orders, and\nno one is above Him to order Him. But when he finds that a pure devotee is\nordering Him, He obtains transcendental pleasure, although He is the infallible\nmaster of all circumstances.\n\n\nAs a pure devotee of the Lord, Arjuna had no desire to fight with his cousins\nand brothers, but he was forced to come onto the battlefield by the obstinacy of\nDuryodhana, who was never agreeable to any peaceful negotiation. Therefore, he\nwas very anxious to see who the leading persons present on the battlefield were.\nAlthough there was no question of a peacemaking endeavor on the battlefield, he\nwanted to see them again, and to see how much they were bent upon demanding an\nunwanted war.\n\n\n1.23\n\n\nyotsyam\u0101n\u0101n avek\u1e63e \u2019ha\u1e41\n\n\nya ete \u2019tra sam\u0101gat\u0101\u1e25\n\n\ndh\u0101rtar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6drasya durbuddher\n\n\nyuddhe priya-cik\u012br\u1e63ava\u1e25\n\n\nyotsyam\u0101n\u0101n\u2014those who will be fighting; avek\u1e63e\u2014let me see; aham\u2014I; ye\u2014who;\nete\u2014those; atra\u2014here; sam\u0101gat\u0101\u1e25\u2014assembled; dh\u0101rtar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6drasya\u2014the son of\nDh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra; durbuddhe\u1e25\u2014evil-minded; yuddhe\u2014in the fight; priya\u2014well;\ncik\u012br\u1e63ava\u1e25\u2014wishing.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nLet me see those who have come here to fight, wishing to please the evil-minded\nson of Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nIt was an open secret that Duryodhana wanted to usurp the kingdom of the\nP\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas by evil plans, in collaboration with his father, Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra.\nTherefore, all persons who had joined the side of Duryodhana must have been\nbirds of the same feather. Arjuna wanted to see them in the battlefield before\nthe fight was begun, just to learn who they were, but he had no intention of\nproposing peace negotiations with them. It was also a fact that he wanted to see\nthem to make an estimate of the strength which he had to face, although he was\nquite confident of victory because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was sitting by his side.\n\n\n1.24\n\n\nsa\u00f1jaya uv\u0101ca\n\n\nevam ukto h\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015bo\n\n\ngu\u1e0d\u0101ke\u015bena bh\u0101rata\n\n\nsenayor ubhayor madhye\n\n\nsth\u0101payitv\u0101 rathottamam\n\n\nsa\u00f1jaya\u1e25\u2014Sa\u00f1jaya; uv\u0101ca\u2014said; evam\u2014thus; ukta\u1e25\u2014addressed; h\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba\u1e25\u2014Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a;\ngu\u1e0d\u0101ke\u015bena\u2014by Arjuna; bh\u0101rata\u2014O descendant of Bharata; senayo\u1e25\u2014of armies;\nubhayo\u1e25\u2014of both; madhye\u2014in the midst of; sth\u0101payitv\u0101\u2014by placing; rathottamam\u2014the\nfinest chariot.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nSa\u00f1jaya said: O descendant of Bharata, being thus addressed by Arjuna, Lord\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a drew up the fine chariot in the midst of the armies of both parties.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nIn this verse Arjuna is referred to as Gu\u1e0d\u0101ke\u015ba. Gu\u1e0d\u0101ka means sleep, and one who\nconquers sleep is called gu\u1e0d\u0101ke\u015ba. Sleep also means ignorance. So Arjuna\nconquered both sleep and ignorance because of his friendship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. As a\ngreat devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he could not forget K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a even for a moment, because\nthat is the nature of a devotee. Either in waking or in sleep, a devotee of the\nLord can never be free from thinking of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s name, form, quality and\npastimes. Thus a devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can conquer both sleep and ignorance simply by\nthinking of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a constantly. This is called K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, or sam\u0101dhi. As\nH\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba, or the director of the senses and mind of every living entity, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\ncould understand Arjuna\u2019s purpose in placing the chariot in the midst of the\narmies.

And the word P\u0101rtha, or the son of Kunt\u012b or\nP\u1e5bth\u0101, is also similarly significant in reference to Arjuna. As a friend, He\nwanted to inform Arjuna that because Arjuna was the son of P\u1e5bth\u0101, the sister of\nHis own father Vasudeva, He had agreed to be the charioteer of Arjuna. Now what\ndid K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mean when He told Arjuna to \u201cbehold the Kurus\u201d? Did Arjuna want to\nstop there and not fight? K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a never expected such things from the son of His\naunt P\u1e5bth\u0101.

As such, Arjuna, just after seeing his kinsmen, friends and\nrelatives on the battlefield, was at once overwhelmed by compassion for them who\nhad so decided to fight amongst themselves. As far as his soldiers were\nconcerned, he was sympathetic from the beginning, but he felt compassion even\nfor the soldiers of the opposite party, foreseeing their imminent death. And so\nthinking, the limbs of his body began to quiver, and his mouth became dry. He\nwas more or less astonished to see their fighting spirit. Practically the whole\ncommunity, all blood relatives of Arjuna, had come to fight with him. This\noverwhelmed a kind devotee like Arjuna. Although it is not mentioned here, still\none can easily imagine that not only were Arjuna\u2019s bodily limbs quivering and\nhis mouth drying up, but that he was also crying out of compassion. Such\nsymptoms in Arjuna were not due to weakness but to his softheartedness, a\ncharacteristic of a pure devotee of the Lord. It is said therefore:\n\n\nyasy\u0101sti bhaktir bhagavaty aki\u00f1can\u0101 sarvair gu\u1e47ais tatra sam\u0101sate sur\u0101\u1e25 har\u0101v\nabhaktasya kuto mahad-gu\u1e47\u0101 mano-rathen\u0101sati dh\u0101vato bahi\u1e25\n\n\n\u201cOne who has unflinching devotion for the Personality of Godhead has all the\ngood qualities of the demigods.

Such phenomena occur either in great spiritual ecstasy or out of\ngreat fear under material conditions. There is no fear in transcendental\nrealization. Arjuna\u2019s symptoms in this situation are out of material\nfear\u2014namely, loss of life. This is evident from other symptoms also; he became\nso impatient that his famous bow G\u0101\u1e47\u1e0d\u012bva was slipping from his hands, and,\nbecause his heart was burning within him, he was feeling a burning sensation of\nthe skin.

Excessive attachment\nfor material things puts a man in a bewildering condition of existence. Bhaya\u1e41\ndvit\u012by\u0101bhinive\u015bata\u1e25: such fearfulness and loss of mental equilibrium take place\nin persons who are too affected by material conditions. Arjuna envisioned only\nunhappiness in the battlefield\u2014he would not be happy even by gaining victory\nover the foe. The word nimitta is significant. When a man sees only frustration\nin his expectations, he thinks, \u201cWhy am I here?\u201d Everyone is interested in\nhimself and his own welfare. No one is interested in the Supreme Self. Arjuna is\nsupposed to show disregard for self-interest by submission to the will of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a,\nwho is everyone\u2019s real self-interest. The conditioned soul forgets this, and\ntherefore suffers material pains.

Under delusion, they forget that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is also the cause of material\nhappiness. Arjuna appears to have even forgotten the moral codes for a k\u1e63atriya.\nIt is said that two kinds of men, namely the k\u1e63atriya who dies directly in front\nof the battlefield under K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s personal orders and the person in the renounced\norder of life who is absolutely devoted to spiritual culture, are eligible to\nenter into the sun-globe, which is so powerful and dazzling. Arjuna is reluctant\neven to kill his enemies, let alone his relatives. He thought that by killing\nhis kinsmen there would be no happiness in his life, and therefore he was not\nwilling to fight, just as a person who does not feel hunger is not inclined to\ncook. He has now decided to go into the forest and live a secluded life in\nfrustration. But as a k\u1e63atriya, he requires a kingdom for his subsistence,\nbecause the k\u1e63atriyas cannot engage themselves in any other occupation. But\nArjuna has had no kingdom. Arjuna\u2019s sole opportunity for gaining a kingdom lay\nin fighting with his cousins and brothers and reclaiming the kingdom inherited\nfrom his father, which he does not like to do. Therefore he considers himself\nfit to go to the forest to live a secluded life of frustration.\n\n\n1.32-35\n\n\nki\u1e41 no r\u0101jyena govinda\n\n\nki\u1e41 bhogair j\u012bvitena v\u0101\n\n\nye\u1e63\u0101m arthe k\u0101\u1e45k\u1e63ita\u1e41 no\n\n\nr\u0101jya\u1e41 bhog\u0101\u1e25 sukh\u0101ni ca\n\n\nta ime \u2019vasthit\u0101 yuddhe\n\n\npr\u0101\u1e47\u0101\u1e41s tyaktv\u0101 dhan\u0101ni ca\n\n\n\u0101c\u0101ry\u0101\u1e25 pitara\u1e25 putr\u0101s\n\n\ntathaiva ca pit\u0101mah\u0101\u1e25\n\n\nm\u0101tul\u0101\u1e25 \u015bva\u015bur\u0101\u1e25 pautr\u0101\u1e25\n\n\n\u015by\u0101l\u0101\u1e25 sambandhinas tath\u0101\n\n\net\u0101n na hantum icch\u0101mi\n\n\nghnato \u2019pi madhus\u016bdana\n\n\napi trailokya-r\u0101jyasya\n\n\nheto\u1e25 ki\u1e41 nu mah\u012b-k\u1e5bte\n\n\nnihatya dh\u0101rtar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dr\u0101n na\u1e25\n\n\nk\u0101 pr\u012bti\u1e25 sy\u0101j jan\u0101rdana\n\n\nkim\u2014what use; na\u1e25\u2014to us; r\u0101jyena\u2014is the kingdom; govinda\u2014O K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; kim\u2014what;\nbhogai\u1e25\u2014enjoyment; j\u012bvitena\u2014by living; v\u0101\u2014either; ye\u1e63\u0101m\u2014for whom; arthe\u2014for the\nmatter of; k\u0101\u1e45k\u1e63itam\u2014desired; na\u1e25\u2014our; r\u0101jyam\u2014kingdom; bhog\u0101\u1e25\u2014material\nenjoyment; sukh\u0101ni\u2014all happiness; ca\u2014also; te\u2014all of them; ime\u2014these;\navasthit\u0101\u1e25\u2014situated; yuddhe\u2014in this battlefield; pr\u0101\u1e47\u0101n\u2014lives; tyaktv\u0101\u2014giving\nup; dhan\u0101ni\u2014riches; ca\u2014also; \u0101c\u0101ry\u0101\u1e25\u2014teachers; pitara\u1e25\u2014fathers; putr\u0101\u1e25\u2014sons;\ntath\u0101\u2014as well as; eva\u2014certainly; ca\u2014also; pit\u0101mah\u0101\u1e25\u2014grandfathers;\nm\u0101tul\u0101\u1e25\u2014maternal uncles; \u015bva\u015bur\u0101\u1e25\u2014fathers-in-law; pautr\u0101\u1e25\u2014grandsons;\n\u015by\u0101l\u0101\u1e25\u2014brothers-in-law; sambandhina\u1e25\u2014relatives; tath\u0101\u2014as well as; et\u0101n\u2014all\nthese; na\u2014never; hantum\u2014for killing; icch\u0101mi\u2014do I wish; ghnata\u1e25\u2014being killed;\napi\u2014even; madhus\u016bdana\u2014O killer of the demon Madhu (K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a); api\u2014even if;\ntrailokya\u2014of the three worlds; r\u0101jyasya\u2014of the kingdoms; heto\u1e25\u2014in exchange;\nkim\u2014what to speak of; nu\u2014only; mah\u012b-k\u1e5bte\u2014for the sake of earth; nihatya\u2014by\nkilling; dh\u0101rtar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dr\u0101n\u2014the sons of Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra; na\u1e25\u2014our; k\u0101\u2014what;\npr\u012bti\u1e25\u2014pleasure; sy\u0101t\u2014will there be; jan\u0101rdana\u2014O maintainer of all living\nentities.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nO Govinda, of what avail to us are kingdoms, happiness or even life itself when\nall those for whom we may desire them are now arrayed in this battlefield?

O maintainer of all creatures, I am not\nprepared to fight with them even in exchange for the three worlds, let alone\nthis earth.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nArjuna has addressed Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as Govinda because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the object of all\npleasures for cows and the senses. By using this significant word, Arjuna\nindicates what will satisfy his senses. Although Govinda is not meant for\nsatisfying our senses, if we try to satisfy the senses of Govinda then\nautomatically our own senses are satisfied. Materially, everyone wants to\nsatisfy his senses, and he wants God to be the order supplier for such\nsatisfaction. The Lord will satisfy the senses of the living entities as much as\nthey deserve, but not to the extent that they may covet. But when one takes the\nopposite way\u2014namely, when one tries to satisfy the senses of Govinda without\ndesiring to satisfy one\u2019s own senses\u2014then by the grace of Govinda all desires of\nthe living entity are satisfied. Arjuna\u2019s deep affection for community and\nfamily members is exhibited here partly due to his natural compassion for them.\nHe is therefore not prepared to fight. Everyone wants to show his opulence to\nfriends and relatives, but Arjuna fears that all his relatives and friends will\nbe killed in the battlefield, and he will be unable to share his opulence after\nvictory. This is a typical calculation of material life. The transcendental life\nis, however, different. Since a devotee wants to satisfy the desires of the\nLord, he can, Lord willing, accept all kinds of opulence for the service of the\nLord, and if the Lord is not willing, he should not accept a farthing. Arjuna\ndid not want to kill his relatives, and if there were any need to kill them, he\ndesired that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a kill them personally. At this point he did not know that\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a had already killed them before their coming into the battlefield and that\nhe was only to become an instrument for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This fact is disclosed in\nfollowing chapters. As a natural devotee of the Lord, Arjuna did not like to\nretaliate against his miscreant cousins and brothers, but it was the Lord\u2019s plan\nthat they should all be killed. The devotee of the Lord does not retaliate\nagainst the wrongdoer, but the Lord does not tolerate any mischief done to the\ndevotee by the miscreants. The Lord can excuse a person on His own account, but\nHe excuses no one who has done harm to His devotees. Therefore the Lord was\ndetermined to kill the miscreants, although Arjuna wanted to excuse them.\n\n\n1.36\n\n\np\u0101pam ev\u0101\u015brayed asm\u0101n\n\n\nhatvait\u0101n \u0101tat\u0101yina\u1e25\n\n\ntasm\u0101n n\u0101rh\u0101 vaya\u1e41 hantu\u1e41\n\n\ndh\u0101rtar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dr\u0101n sa-b\u0101ndhav\u0101n\n\n\nsva-jana\u1e41 hi katha\u1e41 hatv\u0101\n\n\nsukhina\u1e25 sy\u0101ma m\u0101dhava\n\n\np\u0101pam\u2014vices; eva\u2014certainly; \u0101\u015brayet\u2014must take upon; asm\u0101n\u2014us; hatv\u0101\u2014by killing;\net\u0101n\u2014all these; \u0101tat\u0101yina\u1e25\u2014aggressors; tasm\u0101t\u2014therefore; na\u2014never;\narh\u0101\u1e25\u2014deserving; vayam\u2014us; hantum\u2014to kill; dh\u0101rtar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dr\u0101n\u2014the sons of\nDh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra; svab\u0101ndhav\u0101n\u2014along with friends; svajanam\u2014kinsmen; hi\u2014certainly;\nkatham\u2014how; hatv\u0101\u2014by killing; sukhina\u1e25\u2014happy; sy\u0101ma\u2014become; m\u0101dhava\u2014O K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a,\nhusband of the goddess of fortune.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nSin will overcome us if we slay such aggressors. Therefore it is not proper for\nus to kill the sons of Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra and our friends. What should we gain, O\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, husband of the goddess of fortune, and how could we be happy by killing\nour own kinsmen?\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nAccording to Vedic injunctions there are six kinds of aggressors: 1) a poison\ngiver, 2) one who sets fire to the house, 3) one who attacks with deadly\nweapons, 4) one who plunders riches, 5) one who occupies another\u2019s land, and 6)\none who kidnaps a wife. Such aggressors are at once to be killed, and no sin is\nincurred by killing such aggressors. Such killing of aggressors is quite\nbefitting for any ordinary man, but Arjuna was not an ordinary person. He was\nsaintly by character, and therefore he wanted to deal with them in saintliness.\nThis kind of saintliness, however, is not for a k\u1e63atriya. Although a responsible\nman in the administration of a state is required to be saintly, he should not be\ncowardly. For example, Lord R\u0101ma was so saintly that people were anxious to live\nin His kingdom, (R\u0101ma-r\u0101jya), but Lord R\u0101ma never showed any cowardice. R\u0101va\u1e47a\nwas an aggressor against R\u0101ma because he kidnapped R\u0101ma\u2019s wife, S\u012bt\u0101, but Lord\nR\u0101ma gave him sufficient lessons, unparalleled in the history of the world. In\nArjuna\u2019s case, however, one should consider the special type of aggressors,\nnamely his own grandfather, own teacher, friends, sons, grandsons, etc. Because\nof them, Arjuna thought that he should not take the severe steps necessary\nagainst ordinary aggressors. Besides that, saintly persons are advised to\nforgive. Such injunctions for saintly persons are more important than any\npolitical emergency. Arjuna considered that rather than kill his own kinsmen for\npolitical reasons, it would be better to forgive them on grounds of religion and\nsaintly behavior. He did not, therefore, consider such killing profitable simply\nfor the matter of temporary bodily happiness. After all, kingdoms and pleasures\nderived therefrom are not permanent, so why should he risk his life and eternal\nsalvation by killing his own kinsmen? Arjuna\u2019s addressing of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as \u201cM\u0101dhava,\u201d\nor the husband of the goddess of fortune, is also significant in this\nconnection. He wanted to point out to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a that, as husband of the goddess of\nfortune, He should not have to induce Arjuna to take up a matter which would\nultimately bring about misfortune. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, however, never brings misfortune to\nanyone, to say nothing of His devotees.\n\n\n1.37-38\n\n\nyady apy ete na pa\u015byanti\n\n\nlobhopahata-cetasa\u1e25\n\n\nkula-k\u1e63aya-k\u1e5bta\u1e41 do\u1e63a\u1e41\n\n\nmitra-drohe ca p\u0101takam\n\n\nkatha\u1e41 na j\u00f1eyam asm\u0101bhi\u1e25\n\n\np\u0101p\u0101d asm\u0101n nivartitum\n\n\nkula-k\u1e63aya-k\u1e5bta\u1e41 do\u1e63a\u1e41\n\n\nprapa\u015byadbhir jan\u0101rdana\n\n\nyadi\u2014if; api\u2014certainly; ete\u2014they; na\u2014do not; pa\u015byanti\u2014see; lobha\u2014greed;\nupahata\u2014overpowered; cetasa\u1e25\u2014the hearts; kula-k\u1e63aya\u2014in killing the family;\nk\u1e5btam\u2014done; do\u1e63am\u2014fault; mitra-drohe\u2014quarreling with friends; ca\u2014also;\np\u0101takam\u2014sinful reactions; katham\u2014why; na\u2014shall not; j\u00f1eyam\u2014know this;\nasm\u0101bhi\u1e25\u2014by us; p\u0101p\u0101t\u2014from sins; asm\u0101t\u2014ourselves; nivartitum\u2014to cease;\nkula-k\u1e63aya\u2014the destruction of a dynasty; k\u1e5btam\u2014by so doing; do\u1e63am\u2014crime;\nprapa\u015byadbhi\u1e25\u2014by those who can see; jan\u0101rdana\u2014O K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nO Jan\u0101rdana, although these men, overtaken by greed, see no fault in killing\none\u2019s family or quarreling with friends, why should we, with knowledge of the\nsin, engage in these acts?\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nA k\u1e63atriya is not supposed to refuse to battle or gamble when he is so invited\nby some rival party. Under such obligation, Arjuna could not refuse to fight\nbecause he was challenged by the party of Duryodhana. In this connection, Arjuna\nconsidered that the other party might be blind to the effects of such a\nchallenge. Arjuna, however, could see the evil consequences and could not accept\nthe challenge. Obligation is actually binding when the effect is good, but when\nthe effect is otherwise, then no one can be bound.

The var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama religion\u2019s principles were so\ndesigned that the good population would prevail in society for the general\nspiritual progress of state and community. Such population depends on the\nchastity and faithfulness of its womanhood. As children are very prone to be\nmisled, women are similarly very prone to degradation. Therefore, both children\nand women require protection by the elder members of the family. By being\nengaged in various religious practices, women will not be misled into adultery.\nAccording to C\u0101\u1e47akya Pa\u1e47\u1e0dit, women are generally not very intelligent and\ntherefore not trustworthy. So, the different family traditions of religious\nactivities should always engage them, and thus their chastity and devotion will\ngive birth to a good population eligible for participating in the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama\nsystem. On the failure of such var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma, naturally the women become\nfree to act and mix with men, and thus adultery is indulged in at the risk of\nunwanted population. Irresponsible men also provoke adultery in society, and\nthus unwanted children flood the human race at the risk of war and pestilence.\n\n\n1.41\n\n\nsa\u1e45karo narak\u0101yaiva\n\n\nkula-ghn\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 kulasya ca\n\n\npatanti pitaro hy e\u1e63\u0101\u1e41\n\n\nlupta-pi\u1e47\u1e0dodaka-kriy\u0101\u1e25\n\n\nsa\u1e45kara\u1e25\u2014such unwanted children; narak\u0101ya\u2014for hellish life; eva\u2014certainly;\nkula-ghn\u0101n\u0101m\u2014of those who are killers of the family; kulasya\u2014of the family;\nca\u2014also; patanti\u2014fall down; pitara\u1e25\u2014forefathers; hi\u2014certainly; e\u1e63\u0101m\u2014of them;\nlupta\u2014stopped; pi\u1e47\u1e0da\u2014offerings; udaka\u2014water; kriy\u0101\u1e25\u2014performance.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nWhen there is increase of unwanted population, a hellish situation is created\nboth for the family and for those who destroy the family tradition. In such\ncorrupt families, there is no offering of oblations of food and water to the\nancestors.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nAccording to the rules and regulations of fruitive activities, there is a need\nto offer periodical food and water to the forefathers of the family. This\noffering is performed by worship of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, because eating the remnants of food\noffered to Vi\u1e63\u1e47u can deliver one from all kinds of sinful actions. Sometimes the\nforefathers may be suffering from various types of sinful reactions, and\nsometimes some of them cannot even acquire a gross material body and are forced\nto remain in subtle bodies as ghosts. Thus, when remnants of pras\u0101dam food are\noffered to forefathers by descendants, the forefathers are released from ghostly\nor other kinds of miserable life. Such help rendered to forefathers is a family\ntradition, and those who are not in devotional life are required to perform such\nrituals.

TRANSLATION  Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra said: O Sa\u00f1jaya, after assembling in the place of pilgrimage at\nKuruk\u1e63etra, what did my sons and the sons of P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du do, being desirous to fight?  PURPORT  Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is the widely read theistic science summarized in the\nG\u012bt\u0101-m\u0101h\u0101tmya (Glorification of the G\u012bt\u0101). There it says that one should read\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 very scrutinizingly with the help of a person who is a devotee of\n\u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and try to understand it without personally motivated interpretations.\nThe example of clear understanding is there in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 itself, in the\nway the teaching is understood by Arjuna, who heard the G\u012bt\u0101 directly from the\nLord. If someone is fortunate enough to understand Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 in that line of\ndisciplic succession, without motivated interpretation, then he surpasses all\nstudies of Vedic wisdom, and all scriptures of the world. One will find in the\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 all that is contained in other scriptures, but the reader will\nalso find things which are not to be found elsewhere. That is the specific\nstandard of the G\u012bt\u0101. It is the perfect theistic science because it is directly\nspoken by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.  The topics discussed by Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra and Sa\u00f1jaya, as described in the\nMah\u0101bh\u0101rata, form the basic principle for this great philosophy. It is\nunderstood that this philosophy evolved on the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra, which\nis a sacred place of pilgrimage from the immemorial time of the Vedic age. It\nwas spoken by the Lord when He was present personally on this planet for the\nguidance of mankind.  The word dharma-k\u1e63etra (a place where religious rituals are performed) is\nsignificant because, on the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra, the Supreme Personality\nof Godhead was present on the side of Arjuna. Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra, the father of the\nKurus, was highly doubtful about the possibility of his sons\u2019 ultimate victory.\nIn his doubt, he inquired from his secretary Sa\u00f1jaya, \u201cWhat did my sons and the\nsons of P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du do?\u201d He was confident that both his sons and the sons of his\nyounger brother P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du were assembled in that Field of Kuruk\u1e63etra for a\ndetermined engagement of the war. Still, his inquiry is significant. He did not\nwant a compromise between the cousins and brothers, and he wanted to be sure of\nthe fate of his sons on the battlefield. Because the battle was arranged to be\nfought at Kuruk\u1e63etra, which is mentioned elsewhere in the Vedas as a place of\nworship\u2014even for the denizens of heaven\u2014Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra became very fearful about\nthe influence of the holy place on the outcome of the battle. He knew very well\nthat this would influence Arjuna and the sons of P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du favorably, because by\nnature they were all virtuous. Sa\u00f1jaya was a student of Vy\u0101sa, and therefore, by\nthe mercy of Vy\u0101sa, Sa\u00f1jaya was able to envision the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra\neven while he was in the room of Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra. And so, Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra asked him\nabout the situation on the battlefield.  Both the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas and the sons of Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra belong to the same family, but\nDh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra\u2019s mind is disclosed herein. He deliberately claimed only his sons as\nKurus, and he separated the sons of P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du from the family heritage. One can thus\nunderstand the specific position of Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra in his relationship with his\nnephews, the sons of P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du. As in the paddy field the unnecessary plants are\ntaken out, so it is expected from the very beginning of these topics that in the\nreligious field of Kuruk\u1e63etra where the father of religion, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, was\npresent, the unwanted plants like Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra\u2019s son Duryodhana and others would\nbe wiped out and the thoroughly religious persons, headed by Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, would\nbe established by the Lord. This is the significance of the words dharma-k\u1e63etre\nand kuru-k\u1e63etre, apart from their historical and Vedic importance.",

TRANSLATION  Then, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a blew His conchshell, called P\u0101\u00f1cajanya; Arjuna blew his, the\nDevadatta; and Bh\u012bma, the voracious eater and performer of Herculean tasks, blew\nhis terrific conchshell called Pau\u1e47\u1e0dram.  PURPORT  Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is referred to as H\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba in this verse because He is the owner of\nall senses. The living entities are part and parcel of Him, and, therefore, the\nsenses of the living entities are also part and parcel of His senses. The\nimpersonalists cannot account for the senses of the living entities, and\ntherefore they are always anxious to describe all living entities as sense-less,\nor impersonal. The Lord, situated in the hearts of all living entities, directs\ntheir senses. But, He directs in terms of the surrender of the living entity,\nand in the case of a pure devotee He directly controls the senses. Here on the\nBattlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra the Lord directly controls the transcendental senses\nof Arjuna, and thus His particular name of H\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba. The Lord has different\nnames according to His different activities. For example, His name is\nMadhus\u016bdana because He killed the demon of the name Madhu; His name is Govinda\nbecause He gives pleasure to the cows and to the senses; His name is V\u0101sudeva\nbecause He appeared as the son of Vasudeva; His name is Devak\u012b-nandana because\nHe accepted Devak\u012b as His mother; His name is Ya\u015bod\u0101-nandana because He awarded\nHis childhood pastimes to Ya\u015bod\u0101 at V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana; His name is P\u0101rtha-s\u0101rathi\nbecause He worked as charioteer of His friend Arjuna. Similarly, His name is\nH\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba because He gave direction to Arjuna on the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra.  Arjuna is referred to as Dhana\u00f1jaya in this verse because he helped his elder\nbrother in fetching wealth when it was required by the King to make expenditures\nfor different sacrifices. Similarly, Bh\u012bma is known as V\u1e5bkodara because he could\neat as voraciously as he could perform Herculean tasks, such as killing the\ndemon Hi\u1e0dimba. So, the particular types of conchshell blown by the different\npersonalities on the side of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, beginning with the Lord\u2019s, were all\nvery encouraging to the fighting soldiers. On the other side there were no such\ncredits, nor the presence of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the supreme director, nor that of the\ngoddess of fortune. So, they were predestined to lose the battle\u2014and that was\nthe message announced by the sounds of the conchshells.",

O King, Arjuna then spoke to H\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba\n[K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a] these words:  PURPORT  The battle was just about to begin.

The emblem of Hanum\u0101n on the flag\nof Arjuna is another sign of victory because Hanum\u0101n cooperated with Lord R\u0101ma\nin the battle between R\u0101ma and R\u0101va\u1e47a, and Lord R\u0101ma emerged victorious.

Therefore,\nArjuna had no cause to fear any enemies whatsoever. And above all, the Lord of\nthe senses, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, was personally present to give him direction.

TRANSLATION  Arjuna said: O infallible one, please draw my chariot between the two armies so\nthat I may see who is present here, who is desirous of fighting, and with whom I\nmust contend in this great battle attempt.  PURPORT  Although Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, out of His causeless\nmercy He was engaged in the service of His friend. He never fails in His\naffection for His devotees, and thus He is addressed herein as infallible. As\ncharioteer, He had to carry out the orders of Arjuna, and since He did not\nhesitate to do so, He is addressed as infallible. Although He had accepted the\nposition of a charioteer for His devotee, His supreme position was not\nchallenged. In all circumstances, He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead,\nH\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba, the Lord of the total senses. The relationship between the Lord and\nHis servitor is very sweet and transcendental. The servitor is always ready to\nrender a service to the Lord, and, similarly, the Lord is always seeking an\nopportunity to render some service to the devotee. He takes greater pleasure in\nHis pure devotee\u2019s assuming the advantageous postion of ordering Him than He\ndoes in being the giver of orders. As master, everyone is under His orders, and\nno one is above Him to order Him. But when he finds that a pure devotee is\nordering Him, He obtains transcendental pleasure, although He is the infallible\nmaster of all circumstances.  As a pure devotee of the Lord, Arjuna had no desire to fight with his cousins\nand brothers, but he was forced to come onto the battlefield by the obstinacy of\nDuryodhana, who was never agreeable to any peaceful negotiation. Therefore, he\nwas very anxious to see who the leading persons present on the battlefield were.\nAlthough there was no question of a peacemaking endeavor on the battlefield, he\nwanted to see them again, and to see how much they were bent upon demanding an\nunwanted war.",

PURPORT  In this verse Arjuna is referred to as Gu\u1e0d\u0101ke\u015ba. Gu\u1e0d\u0101ka means sleep, and one who\nconquers sleep is called gu\u1e0d\u0101ke\u015ba. Sleep also means ignorance. So Arjuna\nconquered both sleep and ignorance because of his friendship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. As a\ngreat devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he could not forget K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a even for a moment, because\nthat is the nature of a devotee. Either in waking or in sleep, a devotee of the\nLord can never be free from thinking of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s name, form, quality and\npastimes. Thus a devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can conquer both sleep and ignorance simply by\nthinking of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a constantly. This is called K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, or sam\u0101dhi. As\nH\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba, or the director of the senses and mind of every living entity, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\ncould understand Arjuna\u2019s purpose in placing the chariot in the midst of the\narmies.

As a friend, He\nwanted to inform Arjuna that because Arjuna was the son of P\u1e5bth\u0101, the sister of\nHis own father Vasudeva, He had agreed to be the charioteer of Arjuna. Now what\ndid K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mean when He told Arjuna to \u201cbehold the Kurus\u201d? Did Arjuna want to\nstop there and not fight? K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a never expected such things from the son of His\naunt P\u1e5bth\u0101. The mind of Arjuna was thus predicated by the Lord in friendly\njoking.",

PURPORT  Any man who has genuine devotion to the Lord has all the good qualities which\nare found in godly persons or in the demigods, whereas the nondevotee, however\nadvanced he may be in material qualifications by education and culture, lacks in\ngodly qualities. As such, Arjuna, just after seeing his kinsmen, friends and\nrelatives on the battlefield, was at once overwhelmed by compassion for them who\nhad so decided to fight amongst themselves. As far as his soldiers were\nconcerned, he was sympathetic from the beginning, but he felt compassion even\nfor the soldiers of the opposite party, foreseeing their imminent death. And so\nthinking, the limbs of his body began to quiver, and his mouth became dry. He\nwas more or less astonished to see their fighting spirit. Practically the whole\ncommunity, all blood relatives of Arjuna, had come to fight with him. This\noverwhelmed a kind devotee like Arjuna. Although it is not mentioned here, still\none can easily imagine that not only were Arjuna\u2019s bodily limbs quivering and\nhis mouth drying up, but that he was also crying out of compassion. Such\nsymptoms in Arjuna were not due to weakness but to his softheartedness, a\ncharacteristic of a pure devotee of the Lord.

PURPORT  Due to his impatience, Arjuna was unable to stay on the battlefield, and he was\nforgetting himself on account of the weakness of his mind. Excessive attachment\nfor material things puts a man in a bewildering condition of existence. Bhaya\u1e41\ndvit\u012by\u0101bhinive\u015bata\u1e25: such fearfulness and loss of mental equilibrium take place\nin persons who are too affected by material conditions.

PURPORT  Without knowing that one\u2019s self-interest is in Vi\u1e63\u1e47u (or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a), conditioned\nsouls are attracted by bodily relationships, hoping to be happy in such\nsituations. Under delusion, they forget that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is also the cause of material\nhappiness. Arjuna appears to have even forgotten the moral codes for a k\u1e63atriya.\nIt is said that two kinds of men, namely the k\u1e63atriya who dies directly in front\nof the battlefield under K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s personal orders and the person in the renounced\norder of life who is absolutely devoted to spiritual culture, are eligible to\nenter into the sun-globe, which is so powerful and dazzling. Arjuna is reluctant\neven to kill his enemies, let alone his relatives. He thought that by killing\nhis kinsmen there would be no happiness in his life, and therefore he was not\nwilling to fight, just as a person who does not feel hunger is not inclined to\ncook. He has now decided to go into the forest and live a secluded life in\nfrustration. But as a k\u1e63atriya, he requires a kingdom for his subsistence,\nbecause the k\u1e63atriyas cannot engage themselves in any other occupation. But\nArjuna has had no kingdom. Arjuna\u2019s sole opportunity for gaining a kingdom lay\nin fighting with his cousins and brothers and reclaiming the kingdom inherited\nfrom his father, which he does not like to do. Therefore he considers himself\nfit to go to the forest to live a secluded life of frustration.",

TRANSLATION  O Govinda, of what avail to us are kingdoms, happiness or even life itself when\nall those for whom we may desire them are now arrayed in this battlefield? O\nMadhus\u016bdana, when teachers, fathers, sons, grandfathers, maternal uncles,\nfathers-in-law, grandsons, brothers-in-law and all relatives are ready to give\nup their lives and properties and are standing before me, then why should I wish\nto kill them, though I may survive? O maintainer of all creatures, I am not\nprepared to fight with them even in exchange for the three worlds, let alone\nthis earth.  PURPORT  Arjuna has addressed Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as Govinda because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the object of all\npleasures for cows and the senses. By using this significant word, Arjuna\nindicates what will satisfy his senses. Although Govinda is not meant for\nsatisfying our senses, if we try to satisfy the senses of Govinda then\nautomatically our own senses are satisfied. Materially, everyone wants to\nsatisfy his senses, and he wants God to be the order supplier for such\nsatisfaction. The Lord will satisfy the senses of the living entities as much as\nthey deserve, but not to the extent that they may covet. But when one takes the\nopposite way\u2014namely, when one tries to satisfy the senses of Govinda without\ndesiring to satisfy one\u2019s own senses\u2014then by the grace of Govinda all desires of\nthe living entity are satisfied. Arjuna\u2019s deep affection for community and\nfamily members is exhibited here partly due to his natural compassion for them.\nHe is therefore not prepared to fight. Everyone wants to show his opulence to\nfriends and relatives, but Arjuna fears that all his relatives and friends will\nbe killed in the battlefield, and he will be unable to share his opulence after\nvictory. This is a typical calculation of material life. The transcendental life\nis, however, different. Since a devotee wants to satisfy the desires of the\nLord, he can, Lord willing, accept all kinds of opulence for the service of the\nLord, and if the Lord is not willing, he should not accept a farthing. Arjuna\ndid not want to kill his relatives, and if there were any need to kill them, he\ndesired that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a kill them personally. At this point he did not know that\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a had already killed them before their coming into the battlefield and that\nhe was only to become an instrument for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This fact is disclosed in\nfollowing chapters. As a natural devotee of the Lord, Arjuna did not like to\nretaliate against his miscreant cousins and brothers, but it was the Lord\u2019s plan\nthat they should all be killed. The devotee of the Lord does not retaliate\nagainst the wrongdoer, but the Lord does not tolerate any mischief done to the\ndevotee by the miscreants. The Lord can excuse a person on His own account, but\nHe excuses no one who has done harm to His devotees. Therefore the Lord was\ndetermined to kill the miscreants, although Arjuna wanted to excuse them.",

TRANSLATION  Sin will overcome us if we slay such aggressors. Therefore it is not proper for\nus to kill the sons of Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra and our friends. What should we gain, O\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, husband of the goddess of fortune, and how could we be happy by killing\nour own kinsmen?  PURPORT  According to Vedic injunctions there are six kinds of aggressors: 1) a poison\ngiver, 2) one who sets fire to the house, 3) one who attacks with deadly\nweapons, 4) one who plunders riches, 5) one who occupies another\u2019s land, and 6)\none who kidnaps a wife. Such aggressors are at once to be killed, and no sin is\nincurred by killing such aggressors. Such killing of aggressors is quite\nbefitting for any ordinary man, but Arjuna was not an ordinary person. He was\nsaintly by character, and therefore he wanted to deal with them in saintliness.\nThis kind of saintliness, however, is not for a k\u1e63atriya. Although a responsible\nman in the administration of a state is required to be saintly, he should not be\ncowardly. For example, Lord R\u0101ma was so saintly that people were anxious to live\nin His kingdom, (R\u0101ma-r\u0101jya), but Lord R\u0101ma never showed any cowardice. R\u0101va\u1e47a\nwas an aggressor against R\u0101ma because he kidnapped R\u0101ma\u2019s wife, S\u012bt\u0101, but Lord\nR\u0101ma gave him sufficient lessons, unparalleled in the history of the world. In\nArjuna\u2019s case, however, one should consider the special type of aggressors,\nnamely his own grandfather, own teacher, friends, sons, grandsons, etc. Because\nof them, Arjuna thought that he should not take the severe steps necessary\nagainst ordinary aggressors. Besides that, saintly persons are advised to\nforgive. Such injunctions for saintly persons are more important than any\npolitical emergency. Arjuna considered that rather than kill his own kinsmen for\npolitical reasons, it would be better to forgive them on grounds of religion and\nsaintly behavior. He did not, therefore, consider such killing profitable simply\nfor the matter of temporary bodily happiness. After all, kingdoms and pleasures\nderived therefrom are not permanent, so why should he risk his life and eternal\nsalvation by killing his own kinsmen? Arjuna\u2019s addressing of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as \u201cM\u0101dhava,\u201d\nor the husband of the goddess of fortune, is also significant in this\nconnection. He wanted to point out to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a that, as husband of the goddess of\nfortune, He should not have to induce Arjuna to take up a matter which would\nultimately bring about misfortune. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, however, never brings misfortune to\nanyone, to say nothing of His devotees.",

PURPORT  A k\u1e63atriya is not supposed to refuse to battle or gamble when he is so invited\nby some rival party. Under such obligation, Arjuna could not refuse to fight\nbecause he was challenged by the party of Duryodhana. In this connection, Arjuna\nconsidered that the other party might be blind to the effects of such a\nchallenge. Arjuna, however, could see the evil consequences and could not accept\nthe challenge. Obligation is actually binding when the effect is good, but when\nthe effect is otherwise, then no one can be bound. Considering all these pros\nand cons, Arjuna decided not to fight.",

PURPORT  Good population in human society is the basic principle for peace, prosperity\nand spiritual progress in life. The var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama religion\u2019s principles were so\ndesigned that the good population would prevail in society for the general\nspiritual progress of state and community. Such population depends on the\nchastity and faithfulness of its womanhood. As children are very prone to be\nmisled, women are similarly very prone to degradation. Therefore, both children\nand women require protection by the elder members of the family. By being\nengaged in various religious practices, women will not be misled into adultery.\nAccording to C\u0101\u1e47akya Pa\u1e47\u1e0dit, women are generally not very intelligent and\ntherefore not trustworthy. So, the different family traditions of religious\nactivities should always engage them, and thus their chastity and devotion will\ngive birth to a good population eligible for participating in the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama\nsystem. On the failure of such var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma, naturally the women become\nfree to act and mix with men, and thus adultery is indulged in at the risk of\nunwanted population. Irresponsible men also provoke adultery in society, and\nthus unwanted children flood the human race at the risk of war and pestilence.",

In such\ncorrupt families, there is no offering of oblations of food and water to the\nancestors.  PURPORT  According to the rules and regulations of fruitive activities, there is a need\nto offer periodical food and water to the forefathers of the family. This\noffering is performed by worship of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, because eating the remnants of food\noffered to Vi\u1e63\u1e47u can deliver one from all kinds of sinful actions. Sometimes the\nforefathers may be suffering from various types of sinful reactions, and\nsometimes some of them cannot even acquire a gross material body and are forced\nto remain in subtle bodies as ghosts. Thus, when remnants of pras\u0101dam food are\noffered to forefathers by descendants, the forefathers are released from ghostly\nor other kinds of miserable life. Such help rendered to forefathers is a family\ntradition, and those who are not in devotional life are required to perform such\nrituals.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the First Chapter of the\n\u015ar\u012bmad-Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 in the matter of Observing the Armies on the Battlefield of\nKuruk\u1e63etra.",

Compassion for the eternal soul is self-realization. The word\n\u201cMadhus\u016bdana\u201d is significant in this verse. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a killed the demon Madhu,\nand now Arjuna wanted K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to kill the demon of misunderstanding that had\novertaken him in the discharge of his duty. No one knows where compassion should\nbe applied. Compassion for the dress of a drowning man is senseless. A man\nfallen in the ocean of nescience cannot be saved simply by rescuing his outward\ndress\u2014the gross material body. One who does not know this and laments for the\noutward dress is called a \u015b\u016bdra, or one who laments unnecessarily. Arjuna was a\nk\u1e63atriya, and this conduct was not expected from him. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, however, can\ndissipate the lamentation of the ignorant man, and for this purpose the\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 was sung by Him. This chapter instructs us in self-realization by\nan analytical study of the material body and the spirit soul, as explained by\nthe supreme authority, Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This realization is made possible by\nworking with the fruitive being situated in the fixed conception of the real\nself.\n\n\n2.2\n\n\n\u015br\u012b-bhagav\u0101n uv\u0101ca\n\n\nkutas tv\u0101 ka\u015bmalam ida\u1e41\n\n\nvi\u1e63ame samupasthitam\n\n\nan\u0101rya-ju\u1e63\u1e6dam asvargyam\n\n\nak\u012brti-karam arjuna\n\n\n\u015br\u012b bhagav\u0101n uv\u0101ca\u2014the Supreme Personality of Godhead said; kuta\u1e25\u2014wherefrom;\ntv\u0101\u2014unto you; ka\u015bmalam\u2014dirtiness; idam\u2014this lamentation; vi\u1e63ame\u2014this hour of\ncrisis; samupasthitam\u2014arrived; an\u0101rya\u2014persons who do not know the value of life;\nju\u1e63\u1e6dam\u2014practiced by; asvargyam\u2014that which does not lead to higher planets;\nak\u012brti\u2014infamy; karam\u2014the cause of; arjuna\u2014O Arjuna.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThe Supreme Person [Bhagav\u0101n] said: My dear Arjuna, how have these impurities\ncome upon you? They are not at all befitting a man who knows the progressive\nvalues of life. They do not lead to higher planets, but to infamy.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and the Supreme Personality of Godhead are identical. Therefore Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nis referred to as \u201cBhagav\u0101n\u201d throughout the G\u012bt\u0101. Bhagav\u0101n is the ultimate in\nthe Absolute Truth. Absolute Truth is realized in three phases of understanding,\nnamely Brahman or the impersonal all-pervasive spirit; Param\u0101tm\u0101, or the\nlocalized aspect of the Supreme within the heart of all living entities; and\nBhagav\u0101n, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In the\n\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam this conception of the Absolute Truth is explained thus:\n\n\nvadanti tat tattva-vidas tattva\u1e41 yaj j\u00f1\u0101nam advayam brahmeti param\u0101tmeti\nbhagav\u0101n iti \u015babdyate.\n\n\n\u201cThe Absolute Truth is realized in three phases of understanding by the knower\nof the Absolute Truth, and all of them are identical. Such phases of the\nAbsolute Truth are expressed as Brahman, Param\u0101tm\u0101, and Bhagav\u0101n.\u201d (Bh\u0101g.\n1.2.11) These three divine aspects can be explained by the example of the sun,\nwhich also has three different aspects, namely the sunshine, the sun\u2019s surface\nand the sun planet itself. One who studies the sunshine only is the preliminary\nstudent. One who understands the sun\u2019s surface is further advanced. And one who\ncan enter into the sun planet is the highest. Ordinary students who are\nsatisfied by simply understanding the sunshine\u2014its universal pervasiveness and\nthe glaring effulgence of its impersonal nature\u2014may be compared to those who can\nrealize only the Brahman feature of the Absolute Truth. The student who has\nadvanced still further can know the sun disc, which is compared to knowledge of\nthe Param\u0101tm\u0101 feature of the Absolute Truth. And the student who can enter into\nthe heart of the sun planet is compared to those who realize the personal\nfeatures of the Supreme Absolute Truth. Therefore, the bhaktas, or the\ntranscendentalists who have realized the Bhagav\u0101n feature of the Absolute Truth,\nare the topmost transcendentalists, although all students who are engaged in the\nstudy of the Absolute Truth are engaged in the same subject matter. The\nsunshine, the sun disc and the inner affairs of the sun planet cannot be\nseparated from one another, and yet the students of the three different phases\nare not in the same category.\n\n\nThe Sanskrit word Bhagav\u0101n is explained by the great authority, Par\u0101\u015bara Muni,\nthe father of Vy\u0101sadeva. The Supreme Personality who possesses all riches, all\nstrength, all fame, all beauty, all knowledge and all renunciation is called\nBhagav\u0101n. There are many persons who are very rich, very powerful, very\nbeautiful, very famous, very learned, and very much detached, but no one can\nclaim that he possesses all riches, all strength, etc., entirely. Only K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can\nclaim this because He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. No living entity,\nincluding Brahm\u0101, Lord \u015aiva, or N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, can possess opulences as fully as\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore it is concluded in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 by Lord Brahm\u0101 himself\nthat Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. No one is equal to or\nabove Him. He is the primeval Lord, or Bhagav\u0101n, known as Govinda, and He is the\nsupreme cause of all causes.\n\n\n\u012b\u015bvara\u1e25 parama\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u1e25 sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha\u1e25 an\u0101dir \u0101dir govinda\u1e25\nsarua-k\u0101ra\u1e47a-k\u0101ra\u1e47am\n\n\n\u201cThere are many personalities possessing the qualities of Bhagav\u0101n, but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is\nthe supreme because none can excel Him. He is the Supreme Person, and His body\nis eternal, full of knowledge and bliss. He is the primeval Lord Govinda and the\ncause of all causes.\u201d (Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 5.1)\n\n\nIn the Bh\u0101gavatam also there is a list of many incarnations of the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead, but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is described as the original Personality of\nGodhead, from whom many, many incarnations and Personalities of Godhead expand:\n\n\nete c\u0101\u1e41\u015ba-kal\u0101\u1e25 pu\u1e41sa\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47as tu bhagav\u0101n svayam indr\u0101ri-vy\u0101kula\u1e41 loka\u1e41\nm\u1e5b\u1e0dayanti yuge yuge\n\n\n\u201cAll the lists of the incarnations of Godhead submitted herewith are either\nplenary expansions or parts of the plenary expansions of the Supreme Godhead,\nbut K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself.\u201d (Bhag. 1.3.28)\n\n\nTherefore, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the original Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Absolute\nTruth, the source of both the Supersoul and the impersonal Brahman.\n\n\nIn the presence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Arjuna\u2019s lamentation for\nhis kinsmen is certainly unbecoming, and therefore K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a expressed His surprise\nwith the word kutas, \u201cwherefrom.\u201d Such unmanly sentiments were never expected\nfrom a person belonging to the civilized class of men known as \u0100ryans. The word\n\u0101ryan is applicable to persons who know the value of life and have a\ncivilization based on spiritual realization. Persons who are led by the material\nconception of life do not know that the aim of life is realization of the\nAbsolute Truth, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, or Bhagav\u0101n, and they are captivated by the external\nfeatures of the material world, and therefore they do not know what liberation\nis. Persons who have no knowledge of liberation from material bondage are called\nnon-\u0100ryans. Although Arjuna was a k\u1e63atriya, he was deviating from his prescribed\nduties by declining to fight. This act of cowardice is described as befitting\nthe non-\u0100ryans. Such deviation from duty does not help one in the progress of\nspiritual life, nor does it even give one the opportunity to become famous in\nthis world. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a did not approve of the so-called compassion of Arjuna for\nhis kinsmen.\n\n\n2.3\n\n\nklaibya\u1e41 m\u0101 sma gama\u1e25 p\u0101rtha\n\n\nnaitat tvayy upapadyate\n\n\nk\u1e63udra\u1e41 h\u1e5bdaya-daurbalya\u1e41\n\n\ntyaktvotti\u1e63\u1e6dha parantapa\n\n\nklaibyam\u2014impotence; m\u0101\u2014do not; sma\u2014take it; gama\u1e25\u2014go in; p\u0101rtha\u2014O son of P\u1e5bth\u0101;\nna\u2014never; etat\u2014like this; tvayi\u2014unto you; upapadyate\u2014is befitting; k\u1e63udram\u2014very\nlittle; h\u1e5bdaya\u2014heart; daurbalyam\u2014weakness; tyaktv\u0101\u2014giving up; utti\u1e63\u1e6dha\u2014get up;\nparantapa\u2014O chastiser of the enemies.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nO son of P\u1e5bth\u0101, do not yield to this degrading impotence. It does not become\nyou. Give up such petty weakness of heart and arise, O chastiser of the enemy.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nArjuna was addressed as the \u201cson of P\u1e5bth\u0101,\u201d who happened to be the sister of\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s father Vasudeva. Therefore Arjuna had a blood relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\nIf the son of a ksatriya declines to fight, he is a k\u1e63atriya in name only, and\nif the son of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a acts impiously, he is a br\u0101hma\u1e47a in name only. Such\nk\u1e63atriyas and br\u0101hma\u1e47as are unworthy sons of their fathers; therefore, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a did\nnot want Arjuna to become an unworthy son of a k\u1e63atriya. Arjuna was the most\nintimate friend of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was directly guiding him on the chariot; but\nin spite of all these credits, if Arjuna abandoned the battle, he would be\ncommitting an infamous act; therefore K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a said that such an attitude in Arjuna\ndid not fit his personality. Arjuna might argue that he would give up the battle\non the grounds of his magnanimous attitude for the most respectable Bh\u012b\u1e63ma and\nhis relatives, but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a considered that sort of magnanimity not approved by\nauthority. Therefore, such magnanimity or so-called nonviolence should be given\nup by persons like Arjuna under the direct guidance of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\n\n\n2.4\n\n\narjuna uv\u0101ca\n\n\nkatha\u1e41 bh\u012b\u1e63mam aha\u1e41 sa\u1e45khye\n\n\ndro\u1e47a\u1e41 ca madhus\u016bdana\n\n\ni\u1e63ubhi\u1e25 pratiyotsy\u0101mi\n\n\np\u016bj\u0101rh\u0101v ari-s\u016bdana\n\n\narjuna\u1e25 uv\u0101ca\u2014Arjuna said; katham\u2014how; bh\u012b\u1e63mam\u2014unto Bh\u012b\u1e63ma; aham\u2014I; sa\u1e45khye\u2014in\nthe fight; dro\u1e47am\u2014unto Dro\u1e47a; ca\u2014also, madhus\u016bdana\u2014O killer of Madhu;\ni\u1e63ubhi\u1e25\u2014with arrows; pratiyotsy\u0101mi\u2014shall counterattack; p\u016bj\u0101-arhau\u2014those who are\nworshipable; aris\u016bdana\u2014O killer of the enemies.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nArjuna said: O killer of Madhu [K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a], how can I counterattack with arrows in\nbattle men like Bh\u012b\u1e63ma and Dro\u1e47a, who are worthy of my worship?\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nRespectable superiors like Bh\u012b\u1e63ma the grandfather and Dro\u1e47\u0101c\u0101rya the teacher are\nalways worshipable.

It\nis general etiquette that superiors are not to be offered even a verbal fight.\nEven if they are sometimes harsh in behavior, they should not be harshly\ntreated. Then, how is it possible for Arjuna to counterattack them? Would K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\never attack His own grandfather, Ugrasena, or His teacher, S\u0101nd\u012bpani Muni?

Under the circumstances, they have lost the respectability of\nteachers. But Arjuna thinks that nevertheless they remain his superiors, and\ntherefore to enjoy material profits after killing them would mean to enjoy\nspoils tainted with blood.### 2.6\n\n\nna caitad vidma\u1e25 kataran no gar\u012byo\n\n\nyad v\u0101 jayema yadi v\u0101 no jayeyu\u1e25\n\n\ny\u0101n eva hatv\u0101 na jij\u012bvi\u1e63\u0101mas\n\n\nte \u2019vasthit\u0101\u1e25 pramukhe dh\u0101rtar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dr\u0101\u1e25\n\n\nna\u2014nor; ca\u2014also; etat\u2014this; vidma\u1e25\u2014do know; katarat\u2014which; na\u1e25\u2014us;\ngar\u012bya\u1e25\u2014better; yat\u2014what; v\u0101\u2014either; jayema\u2014conquer us; yadi\u2014if; v\u0101\u2014or; na\u1e25\u2014us;\njayeyu\u1e25\u2014conquer; y\u0101n\u2014those; eva\u2014certainly; hatv\u0101\u2014by killing; na\u2014never;\njij\u012bvi\u1e63\u0101ma\u1e25\u2014want to live; te\u2014all of them; avasthit\u0101\u1e25\u2014are situated; pramukhe\u2014in\nthe front; dh\u0101rtar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dr\u0101\u1e25\u2014the sons of Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nNor do we know which is better\u2014conquering them or being conquered by them.

If he did not conquer the enemy, begging would be his only\nmeans of subsistence. Nor was there certainty of victory, because either side\nmight emerge victorious. Even if victory awaited them (and their cause was\njustified), still, if the sons of Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra died in battle, it would be very\ndifficult to live in their absence. Under the circumstances, that would be\nanother kind of defeat for them. All these considerations by Arjuna definitely\nprove that he was not only a great devotee of the Lord but that he was also\nhighly enlightened and had complete control over his mind and senses. His desire\nto live by begging, although he was born in the royal household, is another sign\nof detachment. He was truly virtuous, as these qualities, combined with his\nfaith in the words of instruction of \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (his spiritual master), indicate.\nIt is concluded that Arjuna was quite fit for liberation. Unless the senses are\ncontrolled, there is no chance of elevation to the platform of knowledge, and\nwithout knowledge and devotion there is no chance of liberation.

In every step there is perplexity, and therefore it\nbehooves one to approach a bona fide spiritual master who can give one proper\nguidance for executing the purpose of life. All Vedic literatures advise us to\napproach a bona fide spiritual master to get free from the perplexities of life\nwhich happen without our desire. They are like a forest fire that somehow blazes\nwithout being set by anyone. Similarly, the world situation is such that\nperplexities of life automatically appear, without our wanting such confusion.\nNo one wants fire, and yet it takes place, and we become perplexed. The Vedic\nwisdom therefore advises that in order to solve the perplexities of life and to\nunderstand the science of the solution, one must approach a spiritual master who\nis in the disciplic succession. A person with a bona fide spiritual master is\nsupposed to know everything. One should not, therefore, remain in material\nperplexities but should approach a spiritual master. This is the purport of this\nverse.\n\n\nWho is the man in material perplexities? It is he who does not understand the\nproblems of life. In the Garga Upani\u1e63ad the perplexed man is described as\nfollows:\n\n\nyo v\u0101 etad ak\u1e63ara\u1e41 g\u0101rgy aviditv\u0101sm\u0101l lok\u0101t praiti sa k\u1e5bpa\u1e47a\u1e25\n\n\n\u201cHe is a miserly man who does not solve the problems of life as a human and who\nthus quits this world like the cats and dogs, without understanding the science\nof self-realization.\u201d This human form of life is a most valuable asset for the\nliving entity who can ultilize it for solving the problems of life; therefore,\none who does not utilize this opportunity properly is a miser. On the other\nhand, there is the br\u0101hma\u1e47a, or he who is intelligent enough to utilize this\nbody to solve all the problems of life.\n\n\nThe k\u1e5bpa\u1e47as, or miserly persons, waste their time in being overly affectionate\nfor family, society, country, etc., in the material conception of life. One is\noften attached to family life, namely to wife, children and other members, on\nthe basis of \u201cskin disease.\u201d The k\u1e5bpa\u1e47a thinks that he is able to protect his\nfamily members from death; or the k\u1e5bpa\u1e47a thinks that his family or society can\nsave him from the verge of death. Such family attachment can be found even in\nthe lower animals who take care of children also. Being intelligent, Arjuna\ncould understand that his affection for family members and his wish to protect\nthem from death were the causes ot his perplexities. Although he could\nunderstand that his duty to fight was awaiting him, still, on account of miserly\nweakness, he could not discharge the duties. He is therefore asking Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a,\nthe supreme spiritual master, to make a definite solution. He offers himself to\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as a disciple. He wants to stop friendly talks. Talks between the master\nand the disciple are serious, and now Arjuna wants to talk very seriously before\nthe recognized spiritual master. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is therefore the original spiritual\nmaster of the science of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, and Arjuna is the first disciple for\nunderstanding the G\u012bt\u0101. How Arjuna understands the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is stated in\nthe G\u012bt\u0101 itself. And yet foolish mundane scholars explain that one need not\nsubmit to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as a person, but to \u201cthe unborn within K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u201d There is no\ndifference between K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s within and without. And one who has no sense of this\nunderstanding is the greatest fool in trying to understand Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.\n\n\n2.8\n\n\nna hi prapa\u015by\u0101mi mam\u0101panudy\u0101d\n\n\nyac chokam uccho\u1e63a\u1e47am indriy\u0101\u1e47\u0101m\n\n\nav\u0101pya bh\u016bm\u0101v asapatnam \u1e5bddha\u1e41\n\n\nr\u0101jya\u1e41 sur\u0101\u1e47\u0101m api c\u0101dhipatyam\n\n\nna\u2014do not; hi\u2014certainly; prapa\u015by\u0101mi\u2014I see; mama\u2014my; apanudy\u0101t\u2014they can drive\naway; yat\u2014that; \u015bokam\u2014lamentation; uccho\u1e63a\u1e47am\u2014drying up; indriy\u0101\u1e47\u0101m\u2014of the\nsenses; av\u0101pya\u2014achieving; bh\u016bmau\u2014on the earth; asapatnam\u2014without rival;\n\u1e5bddham\u2014prosperous; r\u0101jyam\u2014kingdom; sur\u0101\u1e47\u0101m\u2014of the demigods; api\u2014even; ca\u2014also;\n\u0101dhipatyam\u2014supremacy.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nI can find no means to drive away this grief which is drying up my senses. I\nwill not be able to destroy it even if I win an unrivalled kingdom on the earth\nwith sovereignty like the demigods in heaven.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nAlthough Arjuna was putting forward so many arguments based on knowledge of the\nprinciples of religion and moral codes, it appears that he was unable to solve\nhis real problem without the help of the spiritual master, Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He\ncould understand that his so-called knowledge was useless in driving away his\nproblems, which were drying up his whole existence; and it was impossible for\nhim to solve such perplexities without the help of a spiritual master like Lord\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Academic knowledge, scholarship, high position, etc., are all useless in\nsolving the problems of life; help can only be given by a spiritual master like\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore, the conclusion is that a spiritual master who is one hundred\npercent K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious is the bona fide spiritual master, for he can solve the\nproblems of life. Lord Caitanya said that one who is master in the science of\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, regardless of his social position, is the real spiritual\nmaster.\n\n\nkib\u0101vipra, kib\u0101 ny\u0101s\u012b, \u015b\u016bdra kene naya yei k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-tattva-vett\u0101, sei \u2018guru\u2019 haya.\n\n\n(Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta, Madhya 8.128)\n\n\n\u201cIt does not matter whether a person is a vipra [learned scholar in Vedic\nwisdom] or is born in a lower family, or is in the renounced order of life\u2014if he\nis master in the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he is the perfect and bona fide spiritual\nmaster.\u201d So without being a master in the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, no one\nis a bona fide spiritual master. It is also said in Vedic literatures:\n\n\n\u1e63a\u1e6d-karma-nipu\u1e47o vipro mantra-tantra-vi\u015b\u0101rada\u1e25 avai\u1e63\u1e47avo gurur na sy\u0101d vai\u1e63\u1e47ava\u1e25\n\u015bvapaco guru\u1e25\n\n\n\u201cA scholarly br\u0101hma\u1e47a, expert in all subjects of Vedic knowledge, is unfit to\nbecome a spiritual master without being a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, or expert in the science of\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. But a person born in a family of a lower caste can become a\nspiritual master if he is a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious.\u201d\n\n\nThe problems of material existence\u2014birth, old age, disease and death\u2014cannot be\ncounteracted by accumulation of wealth and economic development. In many parts\nof the world there are states which are replete with all facilities of life,\nwhich are full of wealth, and economically developed, yet the problems of\nmaterial existence are still present. They are seeking peace in different ways,\nbut they ean achieve real happiness only if they consult K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or the\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam\u2014which constitute the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2014or the\nbona fide representative of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the man in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\n\n\nIf economic development and material comforts could drive away one\u2019s\nlamentations for family, social, national or international inebrieties, then\nArjuna would not have said that even an unrivalled kingdom on earth or supremacy\nlike that of the demigods in the heavenly planets would not be able to drive\naway his lamentations. He sought, therefore, refuge in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, and\nthat is the right path for peace and harmony. Economic development or supremacy\nover the world can be finished at any moment by the cataclysms of material\nnature. Even elevation into a higher planetary situation, as men are now seeking\na place on the moon planet, can also be finished at one stroke. The\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 confirms this: k\u1e63\u012b\u1e47e pu\u1e47ye martyaloka\u1e41 vi\u015banti \u201cWhen the results\nof pious activities are finished, one falls down again from the peak of\nhappiness to the lowest status of life.\u201d Many politicians of the world have\nfallen down in that way. Such downfalls only constitute more causes for\nlamentation.\n\n\nTherefore, if we want to curb lamentation for good, then we have to take shelter\nof K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, as Arjuna is seeking to do. So Arjuna asked K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to solve his problem\ndefinitely, and that is the way of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\n\n\n2.9\n\n\nsa\u00f1jaya uv\u0101ca\n\n\nevam uktv\u0101 h\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba\u1e41\n\n\ngu\u1e0d\u0101ke\u015ba\u1e25 parantapa\u1e25\n\n\nna yotsya iti govindam\n\n\nuktv\u0101 t\u016b\u1e63\u1e47\u012b\u1e41 babh\u016bva ha\n\n\nsa\u00f1jaya\u1e25 uv\u0101ca\u2014Sa\u00f1jaya said; evam\u2014thus; uktv\u0101\u2014speaking; h\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015bam\u2014unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a,\nthe master of the senses; gu\u1e0d\u0101ke\u015ba\u1e25\u2014Arjuna, the master at curbing ignorance;\nparantapa\u1e25\u2014the chastiser of the enemies; na yotsye\u2014I shall not fight; iti\u2014thus;\ngovindam\u2014unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the giver of pleasure; uktv\u0101\u2014saying; t\u016b\u1e63\u1e47\u012bm\u2014silent;\nbabh\u016bva\u2014became; ha\u2014certainly.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nSa\u00f1jaya said: Having spoken thus, Arjuna, chastiser of enemies, told K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a,\n\u201cGovinda, I shall not fight,\u201d and fell silent.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nDh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra must have been very glad to understand that Arjuna was not going to\nfight and was instead leaving the battlefield for the begging profession. But\nSa\u00f1jaya disappointed him again in relating that Arjuna was competent to kill his\nenemies (parantapa\u1e25). Although Arjuna was for the time being overwhelmed with\nfalse grief due to family affection, he surrendered unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the supreme\nspiritual master, as a disciple. This indicated that he would soon be free from\nthe false lamentation resulting from family affection and would be enlightened\nwith perfect knowledge of self-realization, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, and would\nthen surely fight. Thus Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra\u2019s joy would be frustrated, since Arjuna\nwould be enlightened. by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and would fight to the end.\n\n\n2.10\n\n\ntam uv\u0101ca h\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba\u1e25 prahasann iva bh\u0101rata senayor ubhayor madhye vi\u1e63\u012bdantam ida\u1e41\nvaca\u1e25\n\n\ntam\u2014unto him; uv\u0101ca\u2014said; h\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba\u1e25\u2014the master of the senses, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a;\nprahasan\u2014smiling; iva\u2014like that; bh\u0101rata\u2014O Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra, descendant of Bharata;\nsenayo\u1e25\u2014of the armies; ubhayo\u1e25\u2014of both parties; madhye\u2014between; vi\u1e63\u012bdantam\u2014unto\nthe lamenting one; idam\u2014the following; vaca\u1e25\u2014words.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nO descendant of Bharata, at that time K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, smiling, in the midst of both the\narmies, spoke the following words to the grief-stricken Arjuna.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe talk was going on between intimate friends, namely the H\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba and the\nGu\u1e0d\u0101ke\u015ba. As friends, both of them were on the same level, but one of them\nvoluntarily became a student of the other. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was smiling because a friend\nhad chosen to become a disciple. As Lord of all, He is always in the superior\nposition as the master of everyone, and yet the Lord accepts one who wishes to\nbe a friend, a son, a lover or a devotee, or who wants Him in such a role. But\nwhen He was accepted as the master, He at once assumed the role and talked with\nthe disciple like the master\u2014with gravity, as it is required. It appears that\nthe talk between the master and the disciple was openly exchanged in the\npresence of both armies so that all were benefitted. So the talks of\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 are not for any particular person, society, or community, but they\nare for all, and friends or enemies are equally entitled to hear them.\n\n\n2.11\n\n\n\u015br\u012b-bhagav\u0101n uv\u0101ca\n\n\na\u015bocy\u0101n anva\u015bocas tva\u1e41\n\n\npraj\u00f1\u0101-v\u0101d\u0101\u1e41\u015b ca bh\u0101\u1e63ase\n\n\ngat\u0101s\u016bn agat\u0101s\u016b\u1e41\u015b ca\n\n\nn\u0101nu\u015bocanti pa\u1e47\u1e0dit\u0101\u1e25\n\n\n\u015br\u012b bhagav\u0101n uv\u0101ca\u2014the Supreme Personality of Godhead said; a\u015bocy\u0101n\u2014that which\nis not worthy of lamentation; anva\u015boca\u1e25\u2014you are lamenting; tvam\u2014you;\npraj\u00f1\u0101-v\u0101d\u0101\u1e25\u2014learned talks; ca\u2014also; bh\u0101\u1e63ase\u2014speaking; gata\u2014lost; as\u016bn\u2014life;\nagata\u2014not past; as\u016bn\u2014life; ca\u2014also; na\u2014never; anu\u015bocanti\u2014lament; pa\u1e47\u1e0dit\u0101\u1e25\u2014the\nlearned.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThe Blessed Lord said: While speaking learned words, you are mourning for what\nis not worthy of grief.

As it will be explained in later chapters, it will be\nclear that knowledge means to know matter and spirit and the controller of both.\nArjuna argued that religious principles should be given more importance than\npolitics or sociology, but he did not know that knowledge of matter, soul and\nthe Supreme is even more important than religious formularies. And, because he\nwas lacking in that knowledge, he should not have posed himself as a very\nlearned man. As he did not happen to be a very learned man, he was consequently\nlamenting for something which was unworthy of lamentation. The body is born and\nis destined to be vanquished today or tomorrow; therefore the body is not as\nimportant as the soul.

The Supreme Personality of\nGodhead is the supreme individual person, and Arjuna, the Lord\u2019s eternal\nassociate, and all the kings assembled there are individual, eternal persons. It\nis not that they did not exist as individuals in the past, and it is not that\nthey will not remain eternal persons. Their individuality existed in the past,\nand their individuality will continue in the future without interruption.\nTherefore, there is no cause for lamentation for anyone.\n\n\nThe M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b theory that after liberation the individual soul, separated by the\ncovering of m\u0101y\u0101 or illusion, will merge into the impersonal Brahman and lose\nits individual existence is not supported herein by Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the supreme\nauthority. Nor is the theory that we only think of individuality in the\nconditioned state supported herein. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a clearly says herein that in the future\nalso the individuality of the Lord and others, as it is confirmed in the\nUpani\u1e63ads, will continue eternally. This statement of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is authoritative\nbecause K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a cannot be subject to illusion. If individuality is not a fact,\nthen K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a would not have stressed it so much\u2014even for the future. The M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b\nmay argue that the individuality spoken of by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not spiritual, but\nmaterial. Even accepting the argument that the individuality is material, then\nhow can one distinguish K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s individuality? K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a affirms His individuality\nin the past and confirms His individuality in the future also. He has confirmed\nHis individuality in many ways, and impersonal Brahman has been declared to be\nsubordinate to Him. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has maintained spiritual individuality all along; if\nHe is accepted as an ordinary conditioned soul in individual consciousness, then\nHis Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 has no value as authoritative scripture. A common man with all\nthe four defects of human frailty is unable to teach that which is worth\nhearing. The G\u012bt\u0101 is above such literature. No mundane book compares with the\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. When one accepts K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as an ordinary man, the G\u012bt\u0101 loses all\nimportance. The M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b argues that the plurality mentioned in this verse is\nconventional and that it refers to the body. But previous to this verse such a\nbodily conception is already condemned. After condemning the bodily conception\nof the living entities, how was it possible for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to place a conventional\nproposition on the body again? Therefore, individuality is maintained on\nspiritual grounds and is thus confirmed by great \u0101c\u0101ryas like \u015ar\u012b R\u0101m\u0101nuja and\nothers. It is clearly mentioned in many places in the G\u012bt\u0101 that this spiritual\nindividuality is understood by those who are devotees of the Lord. Those who are\nenvious of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the Supreme Personality of Godhead have no bona fide access\nto the great literature. The nondevotee\u2019s approach to the teachings of the G\u012bta\nis something like bees licking on a bottle of honey. One cannot have a taste of\nhoney unless one opens the bottle. Similarly, the mysticism of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101\ncan be understood only by devotees, and no one else can taste it, as it is\nstated in the Fourth Chapter of the book. Nor can the G\u012bt\u0101 be touched by persons\nwho envy the very existence of the Lord. Therefore, the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b explanation of\nthe G\u012bt\u0101 is a most misleading presentation of the whole truth. Lord Caitanya has\nforbidden us to read commentations made by the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012bs and warns that one who\ntakes to such an understanding of the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophy loses all power to\nunderstand the real mystery of the G\u012bt\u0101. If individuality refers to the\nempirical universe, then there is no need of teaching by the Lord. The plurality\nof the individual soul and of the Lord is an eternal fact, and it is confirmed\nby the Vedas as above mentioned.\n\n\n2.13\n\n\ndehino \u2019smin yath\u0101 dehe\n\n\nkaum\u0101ra\u1e41 yauvana\u1e41 jar\u0101\n\n\ntath\u0101 deh\u0101ntara-pr\u0101ptir\n\n\ndh\u012bras tatra na muhyati\n\n\ndehina\u1e25\u2014of the embodied; asmin\u2014in this; yath\u0101\u2014as; dehe\u2014in the body;\nkaum\u0101ram\u2014boyhood; yauvanam\u2014youth; jar\u0101\u2014old age; tath\u0101\u2014similarly;\ndeh\u0101ntara\u2014transference of the body; pr\u0101pti\u1e25\u2014achievement; dh\u012bra\u1e25\u2014the sober;\ntatra\u2014thereupon; na\u2014never; muhyati\u2014deluded.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nAs the embodied soul continually passes, in this body, from boyhood to youth to\nold age, the soul similarly passes into another body at death. The self-realized\nsoul is not bewildered by such a change.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nSince every living entity is an individual soul, each is changing his body every\nmoment, manifesting sometimes as a child, sometimes as a youth, and sometimes as\nan old man. Yet the same spirit soul is there and does not undergo any change.\nThis individual soul finally changes the body at death and transmigrates to\nanother body; and since it is sure to have another body in the next birth\u2014either\nmaterial or spiritual\u2014there was no cause for lamentation by Arjuna on account of\ndeath, neither for Bh\u012b\u1e63ma nor for Dro\u1e47a, for whom he was so much concerned.\nRather, he should rejoice for their changing bodies from old to new ones,\nthereby rejuvenating their energy. Such changes of body account for varieties of\nenjoyment or suffering, according to one\u2019s work in life. So Bh\u012b\u1e63ma and Dro\u1e47a,\nbeing noble souls, were surely going to have either spiritual bodies in the next\nlife, or at least life in heavenly bodies for superior enjoyment of material\nexistence. So, in either case, there was no cause of lamentation.\n\n\nAny man who has perfect knowledge of the constitution of the individual soul,\nthe Supersoul, and nature\u2014both material and spiritual\u2014is called a dh\u012bra or a\nmost sober man. Such a man is never deluded by the change of bodies. The\nM\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b theory of oneness of the spirit soul cannot be entertained on the\nground that spirit soul cannot be cut into pieces as a fragmental portion. Such\ncutting into different individual souls would make the Supreme cleavable or\nchangeable, against the principle of the Supreme Soul being unchangeable.\n\n\nAs confirmed in the G\u012bt\u0101, the fragmental portions of the Supreme exist eternally\n(san\u0101tana) and are called k\u1e63ara; that is, they have a tendency to fall down into\nmaterial nature. These fragmental portions are eternally so, and even after\nliberation, the individual soul remains the same\u2014fragmental. But once liberated,\nhe lives an eternal life in bliss and knowledge with the Personality of Godhead.\nThe theory of reflection can be applied to the Supersoul who is present in each\nand every individual body and is known as the Param\u0101tm\u0101, who is different from\nthe individual living entity. When the sky is reflected in water, the\nreflections represent both the sun and the moon and the stars also. The stars\ncan be compared to the living entities and the sun or the moon to the Supreme\nLord. The individual fragmental spirit soul is represented by Arjuna, and the\nSupreme Soul is the Personality of Godhead \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. They are not on the same\nlevel, as it will be apparent in the beginning of the Fourth Chapter. If Arjuna\nis on the same level with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not superior to Arjuna, then their\nrelationship of instructor and instructed becomes meaningless. If both of them\nare deluded by the illusory energy (m\u0101y\u0101), then there is no need of one being\nthe instructor and the other the instructed. Such instruction would be useless\nbecause, in the clutches of m\u0101y\u0101, no one can be an authoritative instructor.\nUnder the circumstances, it is admitted that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Lord,\nsuperior in position to the living entity, Arjuna, who is a forgotten soul\ndeluded by m\u0101y\u0101.\n\n\n2.14\n\n\nm\u0101tr\u0101-spar\u015b\u0101s tu kaunteya\n\n\n\u015b\u012bto\u1e63\u1e47a-sukha-du\u1e25kha-d\u0101\u1e25\n\n\n\u0101gam\u0101p\u0101yino \u2019nity\u0101s\n\n\nt\u0101\u1e41s titik\u1e63asva bh\u0101rata\n\n\nm\u0101tr\u0101\u2014sensuous; spar\u015b\u0101\u1e25\u2014perception; tu\u2014only; kaunteya\u2014O son of Kunt\u012b;\n\u015b\u012bta\u2014winter; u\u1e63\u1e47a\u2014summer; sukha\u2014happiness; du\u1e25kha-da\u1e25\u2014giving pain;\n\u0101gama\u2014appearing; ap\u0101yina\u1e25\u2014disappearing; anity\u0101\u1e25\u2014nonpermanent; t\u0101n\u2014all of them;\ntitik\u1e63asva\u2014just try to tolerate; bh\u0101rata\u2014O descendant of the Bh\u0101rata dynasty.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nO son of Kunt\u012b, the nonpermanent appearance of happiness and distress, and their\ndisappearance in due course, are like the appearance and disappearance of winter\nand summer seasons. They arise from sense perception, O scion of Bharata, and\none must learn to tolerate them without being disturbed.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nIn the proper discharge of duty, one has to learn to tolerate nonpermanent\nappearances and disappearances of happiness and distress. According to Vedic\ninjunction, one has to take his bath early in the morning even during the month\nof M\u0101gha (January-February). It is very cold at that time, but in spite of that\na man who abides by the religious principles does not hesitate to take his bath.\nSimilarly, a woman does not hesitate to cook in the kitchen in the months of May\nand June, the hottest part of the summer season. One has to execute his duty in\nspite of climatic inconveniences. Similarly, to fight is the religious principle\nof the k\u1e63atriyas, and although one has to fight with some friend or relative,\none should not deviate from his prescribed duty. One has to follow the\nprescribed rules and regulations of religious principles in order to rise up to\nthe platform of knowledge because by knowledge and devotion only can one\nliberate himself from the clutches of m\u0101y\u0101 (illusion).\n\n\nThe two different names of address given to Arjuna are also significant. To\naddress him as Kaunteya signifies his great blood relations from his mother\u2019s\nside; and to address him as Bh\u0101rata signifies his greatness from his father\u2019s\nside. From both sides he is supposed to have a great heritage. A great heritage\nbrings responsibility in the matter of proper discharge of duties; therefore, he\ncannot avoid fighting.\n\n\n2.15\n\n\nya\u1e41 hi na vyathayanty ete\n\n\npuru\u1e63a\u1e41 puru\u1e63ar\u1e63abha\n\n\nsama-du\u1e25kha-sukha\u1e41 dh\u012bra\u1e41\n\n\nso \u2019m\u1e5btatv\u0101ya kalpate\n\n\nyam\u2014one who; hi\u2014certainly; na\u2014never; vyathayanti\u2014are distressing; ete\u2014all these;\npuru\u1e63am\u2014to a person; puru\u1e63ar\u1e63abha\u2014is best among men; sama\u2014unaltered;\ndu\u1e25kha\u2014distress; sukham\u2014happiness; dh\u012bram\u2014patient; sa\u1e25\u2014he; am\u1e5btatv\u0101ya\u2014for\nliberation; kalpate\u2014is considered eligible.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nO best among men [Arjuna], the person who is not disturbed by happiness and\ndistress and is steady in both is certainly eligible for liberation.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nAnyone who is steady in his determination for the advanced stage of spiritual\nrealization and can equally tolerate the onslaughts of distress and happiness is\ncertainly a person eligible for liberation. In the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama institution, the\nfourth stage of life, namely the renounced order (sanny\u0101sa) is a painstaking\nsituation. But one who is serious about making his life perfect surely adopts\nthe sanny\u0101sa order of life in spite of all difficulties. The difficulties\nusually arise from having to sever family relationships, to give up the\nconnection of wife and children. But if anyone is able to tolerate such\ndifficulties, surely his path to spiritual realization is complete. Similarly,\nin Arjuna\u2019s discharge of duties as a k\u1e63atriya, he is advised to persevere, even\nif it is difficult to fight with his family members or similarly beloved\npersons. Lord Caitanya took sanny\u0101sa at the age of twenty-four, and His\ndependants, young wife as well as old mother, had no one else to look after\nthem. Yet for a higher cause He took sanny\u0101sa and was steady in the discharge of\nhigher duties. That is the way of achieving liberation from material bondage.\n\n\n2.16\n\n\nn\u0101sato vidyate bh\u0101vo\n\n\nn\u0101bh\u0101vo vidyate sata\u1e25\n\n\nubhayor api d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6do \u2019ntas\n\n\ntv anayos tattva-dar\u015bibhi\u1e25\n\n\nna\u2014never; asata\u1e25\u2014of the nonexistent; vidyate\u2014there is; bh\u0101va\u1e25\u2014endurance;\nna\u2014never; abh\u0101va\u1e25\u2014changing quality; vidyate\u2014there is; sata\u1e25\u2014of the eternal;\nubhayo\u1e25\u2014of the two; api\u2014verily; d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da\u1e25\u2014observed; anta\u1e25\u2014conclusion; tu\u2014but;\nanayo\u1e25\u2014of them; tattva\u2014truth; dar\u015bibhi\u1e25\u2014by the seers.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThose who are seers of the truth have concluded that of the nonexistent there is\nno endurance, and of the existent there is no cessation. This seers have\nconcluded by studying the nature of both.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThere is no endurance of the changing body. That the body is changing every\nmoment by the actions and reactions of the different cells is admitted by modern\nmedical science; and thus growth and old age are taking place in the body. But\nthe spirit soul exists permanently, remaining the same despite all changes of\nthe body and the mind. That is the difference between matter and spirit. By\nnature, the body is ever changing, and the soul is eternal. This conclusion is\nestablished by all classes of seers of the truth, both impersonalist and\npersonalist. In the Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Pur\u0101\u1e47a it is stated that Vi\u1e63\u1e47u and His abodes all have\nself-illuminated spiritual existence. \u201cJyot\u012b\u1e41\u1e63i vi\u1e63\u1e47ur bhavan\u0101ni vi\u1e63\u1e47u\u1e25.\u201d The\nwords existent and nonexistent refer only to spirit and matter. That is the\nversion of all seers of truth.\n\n\nThis is the beginning of the instruction by the Lord to the living entities who\nare bewildered by the influence of ignorance. Removal of ignorance involves the\nreestablishment of the eternal relationship between the worshiper and the\nworshipable and the consequent understanding of the difference between the part\nand parcel living entities and the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One can\nunderstand the nature of the Supreme by thorough study of oneself, the\ndifference between oneself and the Supreme being understood as the relationship\nbetween the part and the whole. In the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btras, as well as in the\n\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, the Supreme has been accepted as the origin of all\nemanations. Such emanations are experienced by superior and inferior natural\nsequences. The living entities belong to the superior nature, as it will be\nrevealed in the Seventh Chapter. Although there is no difference between the\nenergy and the energetic, the energetic is accepted as the Supreme, and energy\nor nature is accepted as the subordinate. The living entities, therefore, are\nalways subordinate to the Supreme Lord, as in the case of the master and the\nservant, or the teacher and the taught. Such clear knowledge is impossible to\nunderstand under the spell of ignorance, and to drive away such ignorance the\nLord teaches the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 for the enlightenment of all living entities for\nall time.\n\n\n2.17\n\n\navin\u0101\u015bi tu tad viddhi\n\n\nyena sarvam ida\u1e41 tatam\n\n\nvin\u0101\u015bam avyayasy\u0101sya\n\n\nna ka\u015bcit kartum arhati\n\n\navin\u0101\u015bi\u2014imperishable; tu\u2014but; tat\u2014that; viddhi\u2014know it; yena\u2014by whom; sarvam\u2014all\nof the body; idam\u2014this; tatam\u2014widespread; vin\u0101\u015bam\u2014destruction; avyayasya\u2014of the\nimperishable; asya\u2014of it; na ka\u015bcit\u2014no one; kartum\u2014to do; arhati\u2014able.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nKnow that which pervades the entire body is indestructible. No one is able to\ndestroy the imperishable soul.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThis verse more clearly explains the real nature of the soul, which is spread\nall over the body. Anyone can understand what is spread all over the body: it is\nconsciousness. Everyone is conscious of the pains and pleasures of the body in\npart or as a whole. This spreading of consciousness is limited within one\u2019s own\nbody. The pains and pleasures of one body are unknown to another. Therefore,\neach and every body is the embodiment of an individual soul, and the symptom of\nthe soul\u2019s presence is perceived as individual consciousness. This soul is\ndescribed as one ten-thousandth part of the upper portion of the hair point in\nsize. The \u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad confirms this:\n\n\nb\u0101l\u0101gra-\u015bata-bh\u0101gasya \u015batadh\u0101 kalpitasya ca bh\u0101go j\u012bva\u1e25 sa vij\u00f1eya\u1e25 sa\nc\u0101nanty\u0101ya kalpate.\n\n\n\u201cWhen the upper point of a hair is divided into one hundred parts and again\n each of such parts is further divided into one hundred parts, each such part is\n the measurement of the dimension of the spirit soul.\u201d (Svet. 5.9) Similarly, in\n the Bh\u0101gavatam the same version is stated:\n\n\nke\u015b\u0101gra-\u015bata-bh\u0101gasya \u015bat\u0101\u1e41\u015ba\u1e25 s\u0101d\u1e5b\u015b\u0101tmaka\u1e25 j\u012bva\u1e25 s\u016bk\u1e63ma-svarupo \u2019ya\u1e41\nsa\u1e45khy\u0101t\u012bto hi cit-ka\u1e47a\u1e25\n\n\n\u201cThere are innumerable particles of spiritual atoms, which are measured as one\nten-thousandth of the upper portion of the hair.\u201d\n\n\nTherefore, the individual particle of spirit soul is a spiritual atom smaller\nthan the material atoms, and such atoms are innumerable. This very small\nspiritual spark is the basic principle of the material body, and the influence\nof such a spiritual spark is spread all over the body as the influence of the\nactive principle of some medicine spreads throughout the body. This current of\nthe spirit soul is felt all over the body as consciousness, and that is the\nproof of the presence of the soul. Any layman can understand that the material\nbody minus consciousness is a dead body, and this consciousness cannot be\nrevived in the body by any means of material administration. Therefore,\nconsciousness is not due to any amount of material combination, but to the\nspirit soul. In the Mu\u1e47\u1e0daka Upani\u1e63ad the measurement of the atomic spirit soul\nis further explained:\n\n\ne\u1e63o \u2019\u1e47ur\u0101tm\u0101 cetas\u0101 veditavyo yasmin pr\u0101\u1e47a\u1e25 pa\u00f1cadh\u0101 sa\u1e41vive\u015ba pr\u0101\u1e47ai\u015b citta\u1e41\nsarvam otam praj\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 yasmin vi\u015buddhe vibhavaty e\u1e63a \u0101tm\u0101.\n\n\n\u201cThe soul is atomic in size and can be perceived by perfect intelligence. This\natomic soul is floating in the five kinds of air [pr\u0101\u1e47a, ap\u0101na, vy\u0101na, sam\u0101na\nand ud\u0101na], is situated within the heart, and spreads its influence all over the\nbody of the embodied living entities. When the soul is purified from the\ncontamination of the five kinds of material air, its spiritual influence is\nexhibited.\u201d (Mu\u1e47\u1e0d. 3.1.9)\n\n\nThe ha\u1e6dha-yoga system is meant for controlling the five kinds of air encircling\nthe pure soul by different kinds of sitting postures\u2014not for any material\nprofit, but for liberation of the minute soul from the entanglement of the\nmaterial atmosphere.\n\n\nSo the constitution of the atomic soul is admitted in all Vedic literatures, and\nit is also actually felt in the practical experience of any sane man. Only the\ninsane man can think of this atomic soul as all-pervading Vi\u1e63\u1e47u-tattva.\n\n\nThe influence of the atomic soul can be spread all over a particular body.\nAccording to the Mu\u1e47\u1e0daka Upani\u1e63ad, this atomic soul is situated in the heart of\nevery living entity, and because the measurement of the atomic soul is beyond\nthe power of appreciation of the material scientists, some of them assert\nfoolishly that there is no soul. The individual atomic soul is definitely there\nin the heart along with the Supersoul, and thus all the energies of bodily\nmovement are emanating from this part of the body. The corpuscles which carry\nthe oxygen from the lungs gather energy from the soul. When the soul passes away\nfrom this position, activity of the blood, generating fusion, ceases. Medical\nscience accepts the importance of the red corpuscles, but it cannot ascertain\nthat the source of the energy is the soul. Medical science, however, does admit\nthat the heart is the seat of all energies of the body.\n\n\nSuch atomic particles of the spirit whole are compared to the sunshine\nmolecules. In the sunshine there are innumerable radiant molecules. Similarly,\nthe fragmental parts of the Supreme Lord are atomic sparks of the rays of the\nSupreme Lord, called by the name prabh\u0101 or superior energy. Neither Vedic\nknowledge nor modern science denies the existence of the spirit soul in the\nbody, and the science of the soul is explicitly described in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101\nby the Personality of Godhead Himself.\n\n\n2.18\n\n\nantavanta ime deh\u0101\n\n\nnityasyokt\u0101\u1e25 \u015bar\u012bri\u1e47a\u1e25\n\n\nan\u0101\u015bino \u2019prameyasya\n\n\ntasm\u0101d yudhyasva bh\u0101rata\n\n\nantavanta\u1e25\u2014perishable; ime\u2014all these; deh\u0101\u1e25\u2014material bodies; nityasya\u2014eternal in\nexistence; ukt\u0101\u1e25\u2014it is so said; sar\u012bri\u1e47a\u1e25\u2014the embodied souls; an\u0101\u015bina\u1e25\u2014never to\nbe destroyed; aprameyasya\u2014immeasurable; tasm\u0101t\u2014therefore; yudhyasva\u2014fight;\nbh\u0101rata\u2014O descendant of Bharata.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nOnly the material body of the indestructible, immeasurable and eternal living\nentity is subject to destruction; therefore, fight, O descendant of Bharata.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe material body is perishable by nature. It may perish immediately, or it may\ndo so after a hundred years. It is a question of time only. There is no chance\nof maintaining it indefinitely. But the spirit soul is so minute that it cannot\neven be seen by an enemy, to say nothing of being killed. As mentioned in the\nprevious verse, it is so small that no one can have any idea how to measure its\ndimension. So from both viewpoints there is no cause of lamentation because the\nliving entity can neither be killed as he is, nor can the material body, which\ncannot be saved for any length of time, be permanently protected. The minute\nparticle of the whole spirit acquires this material body according to his work,\nand therefore observance of religious principles should be utilized. In the\nVed\u0101nta-s\u016btras the living entity is qualified as light because he is part and\nparcel of the supreme light. As sunlight maintains the entire universe, so the\nlight of the soul maintains this material body. As soon as the spirit soul is\nout of this material body, the body begins to decompose; therefore it is the\nspirit soul which maintains this body. The body itself is unimportant. Arjuna\nwas advised to fight and sacrifice the material body for the cause of religion.\n\n\n2.19\n\n\nya ena\u1e41 vetti hant\u0101ra\u1e41\n\n\nya\u015b caina\u1e41 manyate hatam\n\n\nubhau tau na vij\u0101n\u012bto\n\n\nn\u0101ya\u1e41 hanti na hanyate\n\n\nya\u1e25\u2014anyone; enam\u2014this; vetti\u2014knows; hant\u0101ram\u2014the killer; ya\u1e25\u2014anyone; ca\u2014also;\nenam\u2014this; manyate\u2014thinks; hatam\u2014killed; ubhau\u2014both of them; tau\u2014they; na\u2014never;\nvij\u0101n\u012bta\u1e25\u2014in knowledge; na\u2014never; ayam\u2014this; hanti\u2014kills; na\u2014nor; hanyate\u2014be\nkilled.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nHe who thinks that the living entity is the slayer or that he is slain, does not\nunderstand. One who is in knowledge knows that the self slays not nor is slain.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nWhen an embodied living entity is hurt by fatal weapons, it is to be known that\nthe living entity within the body is not killed. The spirit soul is so small\nthat it is impossible to kill him by any material weapon, as is evident from the\nprevious verses. Nor is the living entity killable because of his spiritual\nconstitution. What is killed, or is supposed to be killed, is the body only.\nThis, however, does not at all encourage killing of the body. The Vedic\ninjunction is, \u201cm\u0101hi\u1e41sy\u0101t sarva-bh\u016bt\u0101ni\u201d never commit violence to anyone. Nor\ndoes understanding that the living entity is not killed encourage animal\nslaughter. Killing the body of anyone without authority is abominable and is\npunishable by the law of the state as well as by the law of the Lord. Arjuna,\nhowever, is being engaged in killing for the principle of religion, and not\nwhimsically.\n\n\n2.20\n\n\nna j\u0101yate mriyate v\u0101 kad\u0101cin\n\n\nn\u0101ya\u1e41 bh\u016btv\u0101 bhavit\u0101 v\u0101 na bh\u016bya\u1e25\n\n\najo nitya\u1e25 \u015b\u0101\u015bvato \u2019ya\u1e41 pur\u0101\u1e47o\n\n\nna hanyate hanyam\u0101ne \u015bar\u012bre\n\n\nna\u2014never; j\u0101yate\u2014takes birth; mriyate\u2014never dies; v\u0101\u2014either; kad\u0101cit\u2014at any time\n(past, present or future); na\u2014never; ayam\u2014this; bh\u016btv\u0101\u2014came into being;\nbhavit\u0101\u2014will come to be; v\u0101\u2014or; na\u2014not; bh\u016bya\u1e25\u2014or has come to be; aja\u1e25\u2014unborn;\nnitya\u1e25\u2014eternal; \u015b\u0101\u015bvata\u1e25\u2014permanent; ayam\u2014this; pur\u0101\u1e47a\u1e25\u2014the oldest; na\u2014never;\nhanyate\u2014is killed; hanyam\u0101ne\u2014being killed; \u015bar\u012bre\u2014by the body.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nFor the soul there is never birth nor death. Nor, having once been, does he ever\ncease to be. He is unborn, eternal, ever-existing, undying and primeval. He is\nnot slain when the body is slain.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nQualitatively, the small atomic fragmental part of the Supreme Spirit is one\nwith the Supreme. He undergoes no changes like the body. Sometimes the soul is\ncalled the steady, or k\u016b\u1e6dastha. The body is subject to six kinds of\ntransformations. It takes its birth in the womb of the mother\u2019s body, remains\nfor some time, grows, produces some effects, gradually dwindles, and at last\nvanishes into oblivion. The soul, however, does not go through such changes. The\nsoul is not born, but, because he takes on a material body, the body takes its\nbirth. The soul does not take birth there, and the soul does not die. Anything\nwhich has birth also has death. And because the soul has no birth, he therefore\nhas no past, present or future. He is eternal, ever-existing, and primeval\u2014that\nis, there is no trace in history of his coming into being. Under the impression\nof the body, we seek the history of birth, etc., of the soul. The soul does not\nat any time become old, as the body does. The so-called old man, therefore,\nfeels himself to be in the same spirit as in his childhood or youth. The changes\nof the body do not affect the soul. The soul does not deteriorate like a tree,\nnor anything material. The soul has no by-product either. The by-products of the\nbody, namely children, are also different individual souls; and, owing to the\nbody, they appear as children of a particular man. The body develops because of\nthe soul\u2019s presence, but the soul has neither offshoots nor change. Therefore,\nthe soul is free from the six changes of the body.\n\n\nIn the Ka\u1e6dha Upani\u1e63ad also we find a similar passage which reads:\n\n\nna j\u0101yate mriyate v\u0101 vipa\u015bcin n\u0101ya\u1e41 kuta\u015bcin na vibh\u016bva ka\u015bcit ajo nitya\u1e25\n\u015b\u0101\u015bvato \u2019ya\u1e41 pur\u0101\u1e47o na hanyate hanyam\u0101ne \u015bar\u012bre.\n\n\n(Ka\u1e6dha 1.2.18)\n\n\nThe meaning and purport of this verse is the same as in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, but\nhere in this verse there is one special word, vipa\u015bcit, which means learned or\nwith knowledge.\n\n\nThe soul is full of knowledge, or full always with consciousness. Therefore,\nconsciousness is the symptom of the soul. Even if one does not find the soul\nwithin the heart, where he is situated, one can still understand the presence of\nthe soul simply by the presence of consciousness. Sometimes we do not find the\nsun in the sky owing to clouds, or for some other reason, but the light of the\nsun is always there, and we are convinced that it is therefore daytime. As soon\nas there is a little light in the sky early in the morning, we can understand\nthat the sun is in the sky. Similarly, since there is some consciousness in all\nbodies\u2014whether man or animal\u2014we can understand the presence of the soul. This\nconsciousness of the soul is, however, different from the consciousness of the\nSupreme because the supreme consciousness is all-knowledge\u2014past, present and\nfuture. The consciousness of the individual soul is prone to be forgetful. When\nhe is forgetful of his real nature, he obtains education and enlightenment from\nthe superior lessons of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. But K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not like the forgetful soul. If so,\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s teachings of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 would be useless.\n\n\nThere are two kinds of souls\u2014namely the minute particle soul (a\u1e47u-\u0101tm\u0101) and the\nSupersoul (the vibhu-\u0101tm\u0101). This is also confirmed in the Ka\u1e6dha Upani\u1e63ad in this\nway:\n\n\na\u1e47or a\u1e47\u012by\u0101n mahato mah\u012by\u0101n \u0101tm\u0101sya jantor nihito guh\u0101y\u0101m tam akratu\u1e25 pa\u015byati\nv\u012bta-\u015boko dh\u0101tu\u1e25 pras\u0101d\u0101n mahim\u0101nam \u0101tmana\u1e25\n\n\n(Ka\u1e6dha 1.2.20)\n\n\n\u201cBoth the Supersoul [Param\u0101tm\u0101] and the atomic soul [j\u012bv\u0101tm\u0101] are situated on\nthe same tree of the body within the same heart of the living being, and only\none who has become free from all material desires as well as lamentations can,\nby the grace of the Supreme, understand the glories of the soul.\u201d K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the\nfountainhead of the Supersoul also, as it will be disclosed in the following\nchapters, and Arjuna is the atomic soul, forgetful of his real nature; therefore\nhe requires to be enlightened by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or by His bona fide representative (the\nspiritual master).\n\n\n2.21\n\n\nved\u0101vin\u0101\u015bina\u1e41 nitya\u1e41\n\n\nya enam ajam avyayam\n\n\nkatha\u1e41 sa puru\u1e63a\u1e25 p\u0101rtha\n\n\nka\u1e41 gh\u0101tayati hanti kam\n\n\nveda\u2014in knowledge; avin\u0101\u015binam\u2014indestructible; nityam\u2014always; ya\u1e25\u2014one who;\nenam\u2014this (soul); ajam\u2014unborn; avyayam\u2014immutable; katham\u2014how; sa\u1e25\u2014he;\npuru\u1e63a\u1e25\u2014person; p\u0101rtha\u2014O P\u0101rtha (Arjuna); kam\u2014whom; gh\u0101tayati\u2014hurts;\nhanti\u2014kills; kam\u2014whom.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nO P\u0101rtha, how can a person who knows that the soul is indestructible, unborn,\neternal and immutable, kill anyone or cause anyone to kill?\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nEverything has its proper utility, and a man who is situated in complete\nknowledge knows how and where to apply a thing for its proper utility.\nSimilarly, violence also has its utility, and how to apply violence rests with\nthe person in knowledge. Although the justice of the peace awards capital\npunishment to a person condemned for murder, the justice of the peace cannot be\nblamed because he orders violence to another person according to the codes of\njustice. In Manu-sa\u1e41hit\u0101, the lawbook for mankind, it is supported that a\nmurderer should be condemned to death so that in his next life he will not have\nto suffer for the great sin he has committed. Therefore, the king\u2019s punishment\nof hanging a murderer is actually beneficial. Similarly, when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a orders\nfighting, it must be concluded that violence is for supreme justice, and, as\nsuch, Arjuna should follow the instruction, knowing well that such violence,\ncommitted in the act of fighting for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is not violence at all because, at\nany rate, the man, or rather the soul, cannot be killed; so for the\nadministration of justice, so-called violence is permitted. A surgical operation\nis not meant to kill the patient, but to cure him. Therefore the fighting to be\nexecuted by Arjuna at the instruction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is with full knowledge, so there\nis no possibility of sinful reaction.\n\n\n2.22\n\n\nv\u0101s\u0101\u1e41si j\u012br\u1e47\u0101ni yath\u0101 vih\u0101ya\n\n\nnav\u0101ni g\u1e5bh\u1e47\u0101ti naro \u2019par\u0101\u1e47i\n\n\ntath\u0101 \u015bar\u012br\u0101\u1e47i vih\u0101ya j\u012br\u1e47\u0101ny\n\n\nany\u0101ni sa\u1e41y\u0101ti nav\u0101ni deh\u012b\n\n\nv\u0101s\u0101\u1e41si\u2014garments; j\u012br\u1e47\u0101ni\u2014old and worn out; yath\u0101\u2014as it is; vih\u0101ya\u2014giving up;\nnav\u0101ni\u2014new garments; g\u1e5bh\u1e47\u0101ti\u2014does accept; nara\u1e25\u2014a man; apar\u0101\u1e47i\u2014other; tath\u0101\u2014in\nthe same way; \u015bar\u012br\u0101\u1e47i\u2014bodies; vih\u0101ya\u2014giving up; j\u012br\u1e47\u0101ni\u2014old and useless;\nany\u0101ni\u2014different; sa\u1e41y\u0101ti\u2014verily accepts; nav\u0101ni\u2014new sets; deh\u012b\u2014the embodied.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nAs a person puts on new garments, giving up old ones, similarly, the soul\naccepts new material bodies, giving up the old and useless ones.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nChange of body by the atomic individual soul is an accepted fact. Even some of\nthe modern scientists who do not believe in the existence of the soul, but at\nthe same time cannot explain the source of energy from the heart, have to accept\ncontinuous changes of body which appear from childhood to boyhood and from\nboyhood to youth and again from youth to old age. From old age, the change is\ntransferred to another body. This has already been explained in the previous\nverse.\n\n\nTransference of the atomic individual soul to another body is made possible by\nthe grace of the Supersoul.The Supersoul fulfills the desire of the atomic soul\nas one friend fulfills the desire of another. The Vedas, like the Mu\u1e47\u1e0daka\nUpani\u1e63ad, as well as the \u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upanisad, compare the soul and the\nSupersoul to two friendly birds sitting on the same tree. One of the birds (the\nindividual atomic soul) is eating the fruit of the tree, and the other bird\n(K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a) is simply watching His friend. Of these two birds\u2014although they are the\nsame in quality\u2014one is captivated by the fruits of the material tree, while the\nother is simply witnessing the activities of His friend. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the witnessing\nbird, and Arjuna is the eating bird. Although they are friends, one is still the\nmaster and the other is the servant. Forgetfulness of this relationship by the\natomic soul is the cause of one\u2019s changing his position from one tree to another\nor from one body to another. The j\u012bva soul is struggling very hard on the tree\nof the material body, but as soon as he agrees to accept the other bird as the\nsupreme spiritual master\u2014as Arjuna agreed to do by voluntary surrender unto\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a for instruction\u2014the subordinate bird immediately becomes free from all\nlamentations. Both the Ka\u1e6dha Upani\u1e63ad and \u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad confirm this:\n\n\nsam\u0101ne v\u1e5bk\u1e63e puru\u1e63o nimagno \u2019n\u012b\u015bay\u0101 \u015bocati muhyam\u0101na\u1e25 ju\u1e63\u1e6da\u1e41 yad\u0101 pa\u015byaty anyam\n\u012b\u015bam asya mahim\u0101nam iti v\u012bta-\u015boka\u1e25\n\n\n\u201cAlthough the two birds are in the same tree, the eating bird is fully engrossed\nwith anxiety and moroseness as the enjoyer of the fruits of the tree. But if in\nsome way or other he turns his face to his friend who is the Lord and knows His\nglories\u2014at once the suffering bird becomes free from all anxieties.\u201d Arjuna has\nnow turned his face towards his eternal friend, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and is understanding the\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 from Him. And thus, hearing from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he can understand the\nsupreme glories of the Lord and be free from lamentation.\n\n\nArjuna is advised herewith by the Lord not to lament for the bodily change of\nhis old grandfather and his teacher. He should rather be happy to kill their\nbodies in the righteous fight so that they may be cleansed at once of all\nreactions from various bodily activities. One who lays down his life on the\nsacrificial altar, or in the proper battlefield, is at once cleansed of bodily\nreactions and promoted to a higher status of life. So there was no cause for\nArjuna\u2019s lamentation.\n\n\n2.23\n\n\nnaina\u1e41 chindanti \u015bastr\u0101\u1e47i\n\n\nnaina\u1e41 dahati p\u0101vaka\u1e25\n\n\nna caina\u1e41 kledayanty \u0101po\n\n\nna \u015bo\u1e63ayati m\u0101ruta\u1e25\n\n\nna\u2014never; enam\u2014unto this soul; chindanti\u2014can cut into pieces; \u015bastr\u0101\u1e47i \u2014all\nweapons; na\u2014never; enam\u2014unto this soul; dahati\u2014burns; p\u0101vaka\u1e25\u2014fire; na\u2014never;\nca\u2014also; enam\u2014unto this soul; kledayanti\u2014moistens; \u0101pa\u1e25 \u2014water; na\u2014never;\n\u015bo\u1e63ayati\u2014dries; m\u0101ruta\u1e25\u2014wind.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThe soul can never be cut into pieces by any weapon, nor can he be burned by\nfire, nor moistened by water, nor withered by the wind.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nAll kinds of weapons, swords, flames, rains, tornadoes, etc., are unable to kill\nthe spirit soul. It appears that there were many kinds of weapons made of earth,\nwater, air, ether, etc., in addition to the modern weapons of fire. Even the\nnuclear weapons of the modern age are classified as fire weapons, but formerly\nthere were other weapons made of all different types of material elements.\nFirearms were counteracted by water weapons, which are now unknown to modern\nscience. Nor do modern scientists have knowledge of tornado weapons.\nNonetheless, the soul can never be cut into pieces, nor annihilated by any\nnumber of weapons, regardless of scientific devices.\n\n\nNor was it ever possible to cut the individual souls from the original Soul. The\nM\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b, however, cannot describe how the individual soul evolved from\nignorance and consequently became covered by illusory energy. Because they are\natomic individual souls (san\u0101tana) eternally, they are prone to be covered by\nthe illusory energy, and thus they become separated from the association of the\nSupreme Lord, just as the sparks of the fire, although one in quality with the\nfire, are prone to be extinguished when out of the fire. In the Var\u0101ha Pur\u0101\u1e47a,\nthe living entities are described as separated parts and parcels of the Supreme.\nThey are eternally so, according to the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 also. So, even after being\nliberated from illusion, the living entity remains a separate identity, as is\nevident from the teachings of the Lord to Arjuna. Arjuna became liberated by the\nknowledge received from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but he never became one with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\n\n\n2.24\n\n\nacchedyo \u2019yam ad\u0101hyo \u2019yam\n\n\nakledyo \u2019\u015bo\u1e63ya eva ca\n\n\nnitya\u1e25 sarva-gata\u1e25 sth\u0101\u1e47ur\n\n\nacalo \u2019ya\u1e41 san\u0101tana\u1e25\n\n\nacchedya\u1e25\u2014unbreakable; ayam\u2014this soul; ad\u0101hya\u1e25\u2014cannot be burned; ayam\u2014this soul;\nakledya\u1e25\u2014insoluble; a\u015bo\u1e63ya\u1e25\u2014cannot be dried; eva\u2014certainly; ca\u2014and;\nnitya\u1e25\u2014everlasting; sarva-gata\u1e25\u2014all-pervading; sth\u0101\u1e47u\u1e25\u2014unchangeable;\nacala\u1e25\u2014immovable; ayam\u2014this soul; san\u0101tana\u1e25\u2014eternally the same.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThis individual soul is unbreakable and insoluble, and can be neither burned nor\ndried. He is everlasting, all-pervading, unchangeable, immovable and eternally\nthe same.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nAll these qualifications of the atomic soul definitely prove that the individual\nsoul is eternally the atomic particle of the spirit whole, and he remains the\nsame atom eternally, without change. The theory of monism is very difficult to\napply in this case, because the individual soul is never expected to become one\nhomogeneously. After liberation from material contamination, the atomic soul may\nprefer to remain as a spiritual spark in the effulgent rays of the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead, but the intelligent souls enter into the spiritual\nplanets to associate with the Personality of Godhead.\n\n\nThe word sarva-gata\u1e25 (all-pervading) is significant because there is no doubt\nthat living entities are all over God\u2019s creation. They live on the land, in the\nwater, in the air, within the earth and even within fire. The belief that they\nare sterilized in fire is not acceptable, because it is clearly stated here that\nthe soul cannot be burned by fire. Therefore, there is no doubt that there are\nliving entities also in the sun planet with suitable bodies to live there. If\nthe sun globe is uninhabited, then the word sarva-gata\u1e25\u2014living\neverywhere\u2014becomes meaningless.\n\n\n2.25\n\n\navyakto \u2019yam acintyo \u2019yam\n\n\navik\u0101ryo \u2019yam ucyate\n\n\ntasm\u0101d eva\u1e41 viditvaina\u1e41\n\n\nn\u0101nu\u015bocitum arhasi\n\n\navyakta\u1e25\u2014invisible; ayam\u2014this soul; acintya\u1e25\u2014inconceivable; ayam\u2014this soul;\navik\u0101rya\u1e25\u2014unchangeable; ayam\u2014this soul; ucyate\u2014is said; tasm\u0101t\u2014therefore;\nevam\u2014like this; viditv\u0101\u2014knowing it well; enam\u2014this soul; na\u2014do not;\nanu\u015bocitum\u2014may lament over; arhasi\u2014you deserve.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nIt is said that the soul is invisible, inconceivable, immutable, and\nunchangeable. Knowing this, you should not grieve for the body.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nAs described previously, the magnitude of the soul is so small for our material\ncalculation that he cannot be seen even by the most powerful microscope;\ntherefore, he is invisible. As far as the soul\u2019s existence is concerned, no one\ncan establish his existence experimentally beyond the proof of \u015bruti or Vedic\nwisdom. We have to accept this truth, because there is no other source of\nunderstanding the existence of the soul, although it is a fact by perception.\nThere are many things we have to accept solely on grounds of superior authority.\nNo one can deny the existence of his father, based upon the authority of his\nmother. There is no other source of understanding the identity of the father\nexcept by the authority of the mother. Similarly, there is no other source of\nunderstanding the soul except by studying the Vedas. In other words, the soul is\ninconceivable by human experimental knowledge. The soul is consciousness and\nconscious\u2014that also is the statement of the Vedas, and we have to accept that.\nUnlike the bodily changes, there is no change in the soul. As eternally\nunchangeable, the soul remains atomic in comparison to the infinite Supreme\nSoul. The Supreme Soul is infinite, and the atomic soul is infinitesimal.\nTherefore, the infinitesimal soul, being unchangeable, can never become equal to\nthe infinite soul, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This concept is\nrepeated in the Vedas in different ways just to confirm the stability of the\nconception of the soul. Repetition of something is necessary in order that we\nunderstand the matter thoroughly without error.\n\n\n2.26\n\n\natha caina\u1e41 nitya-j\u0101ta\u1e41\n\n\nnitya\u1e41 v\u0101 manyase m\u1e5btam\n\n\ntath\u0101pi tva\u1e41 mah\u0101-b\u0101ho\n\n\nnaina\u1e41 \u015bocitum arhasi\n\n\natha\u2014if, however; ca\u2014also; enam\u2014this soul; nitya-j\u0101tam\u2014always born;\nnityam\u2014forever; v\u0101\u2014either; manyase\u2014so think; m\u1e5btam\u2014dead; tath\u0101pi\u2014still;\ntvam\u2014you; mah\u0101-b\u0101ho\u2014O mighty-armed one; na\u2014never; enam\u2014about the soul;\n\u015bocitum\u2014to lament; arhasi\u2014deserve.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nIf, however, you think that the soul is perpetually born and always dies, still\nyou have no reason to lament, O mighty-armed.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThere is always a class of philosophers, almost akin to the Buddhists, who do\nnot believe in the separate existence of the soul beyond the body. When Lord\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a spoke the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, it appears that such philosophers existed, and\nthey were known as the Lok\u0101yatikas and Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ikas. These philosophers\nmaintained that life symptoms, or soul, takes place at a certain mature\ncondition of material combination. The modern material scientist and materialist\nphilosophers also think similarly. According to them, the body is a combination\nof physical elements, and at a certain stage the life symptoms develop by\ninteraction of the physical and chemical elements. The science of anthropology\nis based on this philosophy. Currently, many pseudo-religions\u2014now becoming\nfashionable in America\u2014are also adhering to this philosophy, as well as to the\nnihilistic nondevotional Buddhist sects.\n\n\nEven if Arjuna did not believe in the existence of the soul\u2014as in the Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika\nphilosophy\u2014there would still have been no cause for lamentation. No one laments\nthe loss of a certain bulk of chemicals and stops discharging his prescribed\nduty. On the other hand, in modern science and scientific warfare, so many tons\nof chemicals are wasted for achieving victory over the enemy. According to the\nVaibh\u0101\u1e63ika philosophy, the so-called soul or \u0101tm\u0101 vanishes along with the\ndeterioration of the body. So, in any case, whether Arjuna accepted the Vedic\nconclusion that there is an atomic soul, or whether he did not believe in the\nexistence of the soul, he had no reason to lament. According to this theory,\nsince there are so many living entities generating out of matter every moment,\nand so many of them are being vanquished every moment, there is no need to\ngrieve for such an incidence. However, since he was not risking rebirth of the\nsoul, Arjuna had no reason to be afraid of being affected with sinful reactions\ndue to his killing his grandfather and teacher. But at the same time, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nsarcastically addressed Arjuna as mah\u0101-b\u0101hu, mighty-armed, because He, at least,\ndid not accept the theory of the Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ikas, which leaves aside the Vedic\nwisdom. As a k\u1e63atriya, Arjuna belonged to the Vedic culture, and it behooved him\nto continue to follow its principles.\n\n\n2.27\n\n\nj\u0101tasya hi dhruvo m\u1e5btyur\n\n\ndhruva\u1e41 janma m\u1e5btasya ca\n\n\ntasm\u0101d aparih\u0101rye \u2019rthe\n\n\nna tva\u1e41 \u015bocitum arhasi\n\n\nj\u0101tasya\u2014one who has taken his birth; hi\u2014certainly; dhruva\u1e25\u2014a fact; m\u1e5btyu\u1e25\u2014death;\ndhruvam\u2014it is also a fact; janma\u2014birth; m\u1e5btasya\u2014of the dead; ca\u2014also;\ntasm\u0101t\u2014therefore; aparih\u0101rye\u2014for that which is unavoidable; arthe\u2014in the matter\nof; na\u2014do not; tvam\u2014you; \u015bocitum\u2014to lament; arhasi\u2014deserve.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nFor one who has taken his birth, death is certain; and for one who is dead,\nbirth is certain. Therefore, in the unavoidable discharge of your duty, you\nshould not lament.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nOne has to take birth according to one\u2019s activities of life. And, after\nfinishing one term of activities, one has to die to take birth for the next. In\nthis way the cycle of birth and death is revolving, one after the other without\nliberation. This cycle of birth and death does not, however, support unnecessary\nmurder, slaughter and war. But at the same time, violence and war are inevitable\nfactors in human society for keeping law and order.\n\n\nThe Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra, being the will of the Supreme, was an inevitable\nevent, and to fight for the right cause is the duty of a k\u1e63atriya. Why should he\nbe afraid of or aggrieved at the death of his relatives since he was discharging\nhis proper duty? He did not deserve to break the law, thereby becoming subjected\nto the reactions of sinful acts, of which he was so afraid. By avoiding the\ndischarge of his proper duty, he would not be able to stop the death of his\nrelatives, and he would be degraded due to his selection of the wrong path of\naction.\n\n\n2.28\n\n\navyakt\u0101d\u012bni bh\u016bt\u0101ni\n\n\nvyakta-madhy\u0101ni bh\u0101rata\n\n\navyakta-nidhan\u0101ny eva\n\n\ntatra k\u0101 paridevan\u0101\n\n\navyakt\u0101d\u012bni\u2014in the beginning unmanifested; bh\u016bt\u0101ni\u2014all that are created;\nvyakta\u2014manifested; madhy\u0101ni\u2014in the middle; bh\u0101rata\u2014O descendant of Bharata;\navyakta\u2014nonmanifested; nidhan\u0101ni\u2014all that are vanquished; eva\u2014it is all like\nthat; tatra\u2014therefore; k\u0101\u2014what; paridevan\u0101\u2014lamentation.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nAll created beings are unmanifest in their beginning, manifest in their interim\nstate, and unmanifest again when they are annihilated. So what need is there for\nlamentation?\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nAccepting that there are two classes of philosophers, one believing in the\nexistence of soul and the other not believing in the existence of the soul,\nthere is no cause for lamentation in either case. Nonbelievers in the existence\nof the soul are called atheists by followers of Vedic wisdom. Yet even if, for\nargument\u2019s sake, we accept the atheistic theory, there is still no cause for\nlamentation. Apart from the separate existence of the soul, the material\nelements remain unmanifested before creation. From this subtle state of\nunmanifestation comes manifestation, just as from ether, air is generated; from\nair, fire is generated; from fire, water is generated; and from water, earth\nbecomes manifested. From the earth, many varieties of manifestations take place.\nTake, for example, a big skyscraper manifested from the earth. When it is\ndismantled, the manifestation becomes again unmanifested and remains as atoms in\nthe ultimate stage. The law of conservation of energy remains, but in course of\ntime things are manifested and unmanifested\u2014that is the difference. Then what\ncause is there for lamentation either in the stage of manifestation or\nunmanifestation? Somehow or other, even in the unmanifested stage, things are\nnot lost. Both at the beginning and at the end, all elements remain\nunmanifested, and only in the middle are they manifested, and this does not make\nany real material difference.\n\n\nAnd if we accept the Vedic conclusion as stated in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (antavanta\nime deh\u0101\u1e25) that these material bodies are perishable in due course of time\n(nityasyokt\u0101\u1e25 \u015bar\u012bri\u1e47a\u1e25) but that soul is eternal, then we must remember always\nthat the body is like a dress; therefore why lament the changing of a dress? The\nmaterial body has no factual existence in relation to the eternal soul. It is\nsomething like a dream. In a dream we may think of flying in the sky, or sitting\non a chariot as a king, but when we wake up we can see that we are neither in\nthe sky nor seated on the chariot. The Vedic wisdom encourages self-realization\non the basis of the nonexistence of the material body. Therefore, in either\ncase, whether one believes in the existence of the soul, or one does not believe\nin the existence of the soul, there is no cause for lamentation for loss of the\nbody.\n\n\n2.29\n\n\n\u0101\u015bcarya-vat pa\u015byati ka\u015bcid enam\n\n\n\u0101\u015bcarya-vad vadati tathaiva c\u0101nya\u1e25\n\n\n\u0101\u015bcarya-vac cainam anya\u1e25 \u015b\u1e5b\u1e47oti\n\n\n\u015brutv\u0101py ena\u1e41 veda na caiva ka\u015bcit\n\n\n\u0101\u015bcaryavat\u2014amazing; pa\u015byati\u2014see; ka\u015bcit\u2014some; enam\u2014this soul;\n\u0101\u015bcaryavat\u2014amazing; vadati\u2014speak; tath\u0101\u2014there; eva\u2014certainly; ca\u2014also;\nanya\u1e25\u2014others; \u0101\u015bcaryavat\u2014similarly amazing; ca\u2014also; enam\u2014this soul;\nanya\u1e25\u2014others; \u015b\u1e5b\u1e47oti\u2014hear; \u015brutv\u0101\u2014having heard; api\u2014even; enam\u2014this soul;\nveda\u2014do know; na\u2014never; ca\u2014and; eva\u2014certainly; ka\u015bcit\u2014anyone.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nSome look on the soul as amazing, some describe him as amazing, and some hear of\nhim as amazing, while others, even after hearing about him, cannot understand\nhim at all.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nSince G\u012btopani\u1e63ad is largely based on the principles of the Upani\u1e63ads, it is not\nsurprising to also find this passage in the Ka\u1e6dha Upani\u1e63ad.\n\n\n\u015brava\u1e47\u0101y\u0101pi bahubhir yo na labhya\u1e25 \u015b\u1e5b\u1e47vanto \u2019pi bahavo ya\u1e25 na vidyu\u1e25 \u0101\u015bcaryo\nvakt\u0101 ku\u015balo \u2019sya labdh\u0101 \u0101\u015bcaryo j\u00f1\u0101t\u0101 ku\u015bal\u0101nu\u015bi\u1e63\u1e6da\u1e25.\n\n\nThe fact that the atomic soul is within the body of a gigantic animal, in the\nbody of a gigantic banyan tree, and also in the microbic germs, millions and\nbillions of which occupy only an inch of space, is certainly very amazing. Men\nwith a poor fund of knowledge and men who are not austere cannot understand the\nwonders of the individual atomic spark of spirit, even though it is explained by\nthe greatest authority of knowledge, who imparted lessons even to Brahm\u0101, the\nfirst living being in the universe. Owing to a gross material conception of\nthings, most men in this age cannot imagine how such a small particle can become\nboth so great and so small. So men look at the soul proper as wonderful either\nby constitution or by description. Illusioned by the material energy, people are\nso engrossed in subject matter for sense gratification that they have very\nlittle time to understand the question of self-understanding, even though it is\na fact that without this self-understanding all activities result in ultimate\ndefeat in the struggle for existence. Perhaps one has no idea that one must\nthink of the soul, and also make a solution of the material miseries.\n\n\nSome people who are inclined to hear about the soul may be attending lectures,\nin good association, but sometimes, owing to ignorance, they are misguided by\nacceptance of the Supersoul and the atomic soul as one without distinction of\nmagnitude. It is very difficult to find a man who perfectly understands the\nposition of the soul, the Supersoul, the atomic soul, their respective\nfunctions, relationships and all other major and minor details. And it is still\nmore difficult to find a man who has actually derived full benefit from\nknowledge of the soul, and who is able to describe the position of the soul in\ndifferent aspects. But if, somehow or other, one is able to understand the\nsubject matter of the soul, then one\u2019s life is successful. The easiest process\nfor understanding the subject matter of self, however, is to accept the\nstatements of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 spoken by the greatest authority, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a,\nwithout being deviated by other theories. But it also requires a great deal of\npenance and sacrifice, either in this life or in the previous ones, before one\nis able to accept K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can,\nhowever, be known as such by the causeless mercy of the pure devotee and by no\nother way.\n\n\n2.30\n\n\ndeh\u012b nityam avadhyo \u2019ya\u1e41\n\n\ndehe sarvasya bh\u0101rata\n\n\ntasm\u0101t sarv\u0101\u1e47i bh\u016bt\u0101ni\n\n\nna tva\u1e41 \u015bocitum arhasi\n\n\ndeh\u012b\u2014the owner of the material body; nityam\u2014eternally; avadhya\u1e25\u2014cannot be\nkilled; ayam\u2014this soul; dehe\u2014in the body; sarvasya\u2014of everyone; bh\u0101rata\u2014O\ndescendant of Bharata; tasm\u0101t\u2014therefore; sarv\u0101\u1e47i\u2014all; bh\u016bt\u0101ni\u2014living entities\n(that are born); na\u2014never; tvam\u2014yourself; \u015bocitum \u2014to lament; arhasi\u2014 deserve.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nO descendant of Bharata, he who dwells in the body is eternal and can never be\nslain.

Therefore Arjuna as a k\u1e63atriya\nshould not abandon his duty out of fear that his grandfather and teacher\u2014Bh\u012b\u1e63ma\nand Dro\u1e47a\u2014will die in the battle. On the authority of \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one has to\nbelieve that there is a soul different from the material body, not that there is\nno such thing as soul, or that living symptoms develop at a certain stage of\nmaterial maturity resulting from the interaction of chemicals. Though the soul\nis immortal, violence is not encouraged, but at the time of war it is not\ndiscouraged when there is actual need for it. That need must be justified in\nterms of the sanction of the Lord, and not capriciously.\n\n\n2.31\n\n\nsva-dharmam api c\u0101vek\u1e63ya\n\n\nna vikampitum arhasi\n\n\ndharmy\u0101d dhi yuddh\u0101c chreyo \u2019nyat\n\n\nk\u1e63atriyasya na vidyate\n\n\nsvadharmam\u2014one\u2019s own religious principles; api\u2014also; ca\u2014indeed;\navek\u1e63ya\u2014considering; na\u2014never; vikampitum\u2014to hesitate; arhasi\u2014you deserve;\ndharmy\u0101t\u2014from religious principles; hi\u2014indeed; yuddh\u0101t\u2014of fighting;\n\u015breya\u1e25\u2014better engagements; anyat\u2014anything else; k\u1e63atriyasya\u2014of the k\u1e63atriya;\nna\u2014does not; vidyate\u2014exist.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nConsidering your specific duty as a k\u1e63atriya, you should know that there is no\nbetter engagement for you than fighting on religious principles; and so there is\nno need for hesitation.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nOut of the four orders of social administration, the second order, for the\nmatter of good administration, is called k\u1e63atriya. K\u1e63at means hurt. One who\ngives protection from harm is called k\u1e63atriya (trayate\u2014to give protection). The\nk\u1e63atriyas are trained for killing in the forest. A k\u1e63atriya would go into the\nforest and challenge a tiger face to face and fight with the tiger with his\nsword. When the tiger was killed, it would be offered the royal order of\ncremation. This system is being followed even up to the present day by the\nk\u1e63atriya kings of Jaipur state. The k\u1e63atriyas are specially trained for\nchallenging and killing because religious violence is sometimes a necessary\nfactor. Therefore, k\u1e63atriyas are never meant for accepting directly the order of\nsanny\u0101sa or renunciation. Nonviolence in politics may be a diplomacy, but it is\nnever a factor or principle. In the religious law books it is stated:\n\n\n\u0101have\u1e63u mitho \u2019nyonya\u1e41 jigh\u0101\u1e41santo mah\u012bk\u1e63ita\u1e25 yuddham\u0101n\u0101\u1e25 para\u1e41 \u015bakty\u0101 svarga\u1e41\ny\u0101nty apar\u0101\u1e45mukh\u0101\u1e25 yaj\u00f1e\u1e63u pa\u015bavo brahman hanyante satata\u1e41 dvijai\u1e25 sa\u1e41sk\u1e5bt\u0101\u1e25\nkila mantrai\u015b ca te \u2019pi svargam av\u0101pnuvan.\n\n\n\u201cIn the battlefield, a king or k\u1e63atriya, while fighting another king envious of\nhim, is eligible for achieving heavenly planets after death, as the br\u0101hma\u1e47as\nalso attain the heavenly planets by sacrificing animals in the sacrificial\nfire.\u201d Therefore, killing on the battle on the religious principle and the\nkilling of animals in the sacrificial fire are not at all considered to be acts\nof violence, because everyone is benefitted by the religious principles\ninvolved. The animal sacrificed gets a human life immediately without undergoing\nthe gradual evolutionary process from one form to another, and the k\u1e63atriyas\nkilled in the battlefield also attain the heavenly planets as do the br\u0101hma\u1e47as\nwho attain them by offering sacrifice.\n\n\nThere are two kinds of svadharmas, specific duties. As long as one is not\nliberated, one has to perform the duties of that particular body in accordance\nwith religious principles in order to achieve liberation. When one is liberated,\none\u2019s svadharma\u2014specific duty\u2014becomes spiritual and is not in the material\nbodily concept. In the bodily conception of life there are specific duties for\nthe br\u0101hma\u1e47as and k\u1e63atriyas respectively, and such duties are unavoidable.\nSvadharma is ordained by the Lord, and this will be clarified in the Fourth\nChapter. On the bodily plane svadharma is called var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma, or man\u2019s\nsteppingstone for spiritual understanding. Human civilization begins from the\nstage of var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma, or specific duties in terms of the specific modes of\nnature of the body obtained. Discharging one\u2019s specific duty in any field of\naction in accordance with var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma serves to elevate one to a higher\nstatus of life.\n\n\n2.32\n\n\nyad\u1e5bcchay\u0101 copapanna\u1e41\n\n\nsvarga-dv\u0101ram ap\u0101v\u1e5btam\n\n\nsukhina\u1e25 k\u1e63atriy\u0101\u1e25 p\u0101rtha\n\n\nlabhante yuddham \u012bd\u1e5b\u015bam\n\n\nyad\u1e5bcchay\u0101\u2014by its own accord; ca\u2014also; upapannam\u2014arrived at; svarga\u2014heavenly\nplanet; dv\u0101ram\u2014door; ap\u0101v\u1e5btam\u2014wide open; sukhina\u1e25\u2014very happy; k\u1e63atriy\u0101\u1e25\u2014the\nmembers of the royal order; p\u0101rtha\u2014O son of P\u1e5bth\u0101; labhante\u2014do achieve;\nyuddham\u2014war; \u012bd\u1e5b\u015bam\u2014like this.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nO P\u0101rtha, happy are the k\u1e63atriyas to whom such fighting opportunities come\nunsought, opening for them the doors of the heavenly planets.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nAs supreme teacher of the world, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a condemns the attitude of Arjuna who\nsaid, \u201cI do not find any good in this fighting. It will cause perpetual\nhabitation in hell.\u201d Such statements by Arjuna were due to ignorance only. He\nwanted to become nonviolent in the discharge of his specific duty. For a\nk\u1e63atriya to be in the battlefield and to become nonviolent is the philosophy of\nfools. In the Par\u0101\u015bara-sm\u1e5bti or religious codes made by Par\u0101\u015bara, the great sage\nand father of Vy\u0101sadeva, it is stated:\n\n\nk\u1e63atriyo hi praj\u0101 rak\u1e63an \u015bastra-p\u0101\u1e47i\u1e25 prada\u1e47\u1e0dayan nirjitya parasainy\u0101di k\u1e63iti\u1e41\ndharme\u1e47a p\u0101layet.\n\n\n\u201cThe k\u1e63atriya\u2019s duty is to protect the citizens from all kinds of difficulties,\nand for that reason he has to apply violence in suitable cases for law and\norder. Therefore he has to conquer the soldiers of inimical kings, and thus,\nwith religious principles, he should rule over the world.\u201d\n\n\nConsidering all aspects, Arjuna had no reason to refrain from fighting. If he\nshould conquer his enemies, he would enjoy the kingdom; and if he should die in\nthe battle, he would be elevated to the heavenly planets whose doors were wide\nopen to him.

And yoga involves controlling the senses.\nArjuna\u2019s proposal not to fight was based on sense gratification. Forgetting his\nprime duty, he wanted to cease fighting because he thought that by not killing\nhis relatives and kinsmen he would be happier than by enjoying the kingdom by\nconquering his cousins and brothers, the sons of Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra. In both ways, the\nbasic principles were for sense gratification. Happiness derived from conquering\nthem and happiness derived by seeing kinsmen alive are both on the basis of\npersona1 sense gratification, for there is a sacrifice of wisdom and duty.\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, therefore, wanted to explain to Arjuna that by killing the body of his\ngrandfather he would not be killing the soul proper, and He explained that all\nindividual persons, including the Lord Himself, are eternal individuals; they\nwere individuals in the past, they are individuals in the present, and they will\ncontinue to remain individuals in the future, because all of us are individual\nsouls eternally, and we simply change our bodily dress in different manners.\nBut, actually, we keep our individuality even after liberation from the bondage\nof material dress. An analytical study of the soul and the body has been very\ngraphically explained by Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. And this descriptive knowledge of the soul\nand the body from different angles of vision has been described here as s\u0101\u1e45khya,\nin terms of the Nirukti dictionary. This s\u0101\u1e45khya has nothing to do with the\ns\u0101\u1e45khya philosophy of the atheist Kapila. Long before the imposter Kapila\u2019s\ns\u0101\u1e45khya, the s\u0101\u1e45khya philosophy was expounded in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam by the\ntrue Lord Kapila, the incarnation of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who explained it to His mother,\nDevah\u016bti. It is clearly explained by Him that the Puru\u1e63a, or the Supreme Lord,\nis active and that He creates by looking over the prak\u1e5bti. This is accepted in\nthe Vedas and in the G\u012bt\u0101. The description in the Vedas indicates that the Lord\nglanced over the prak\u1e5bti, or nature, and impregnated it with atomic individuals\nsouls. All these individuals are working in the material world for sense\ngratification, and under the spell of material energy they are thinking of being\nenjoyers. This mentality is dragged to the last point of liberation when the\nliving entity wants to become one with the Lord. This is the last snare of m\u0101y\u0101\nor sense gratificatory illusion, and it is only after many, many births of such\nsense gratificatory activities that a great soul surrenders unto V\u0101sudeva, Lord\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, thereby fulfilling the search after the ultimate truth.\n\n\nArjuna has already accepted K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as his spiritual master by surrendering\nhimself unto Him: \u015bi\u1e63yas te \u2019ha\u1e41 \u015b\u0101dhi m\u0101\u1e41 tv\u0101\u1e41 prapannam. Consequently, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nwill now tell him about the working process in buddhi-yoga, or karma-yoga, or in\nother words, the practice of devotional service only for the sense gratification\nof the Lord. This buddhi-yoga is clearly explained in Chapter Ten, verse ten, as\nbeing direct communion with the Lord, who is sitting as Param\u0101tm\u0101 in everyone\u2019s\nheart. But such communion does not take place without devotional service. One\nwho is therefore situated in devotional or transcendental loving service to the\nLord, or, in other words, in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, attains to this stage of\nbuddhi-yoga by the special grace of the Lord. The Lord says, therefore, that\nonly to those who are always engaged in devotional service out of transcendental\nlove does He award the pure knowledge of devotion in love. In that way the\ndevotee can reach Him easily in the ever-blissful kingdom of God.\n\n\nThus the buddhi-yoga mentioned in this verse is the devotional service of the\nLord, and the word s\u0101\u1e45khya mentioned herein has nothing to do with the atheistic\ns\u0101\u1e45khya-yoga enunciated by the impostor Kapila. One should not, therefore,\nmisunderstand that the s\u0101\u1e45khya-yoga mentioned herein has any connection with the\natheistic s\u0101\u1e45khya. Nor did that philosophy have any influence during that time;\nnor would Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a care to mention such godless philosophical speculations.\nReal s\u0101\u1e45khya philosophy is described by Lord Kapila in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,\nbut even that s\u0101\u1e45khya has nothing to do with the current topics. Here, s\u0101\u1e45khya\nmeans analytical description of the body and the soul. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a made an\nanalytical description of the soul just to bring Arjuna to the point of\nbuddhi-yoga, or bhakti-yoga. Therefore, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s s\u0101\u1e45khya and Lord Kapila\u2019s\ns\u0101\u1e45khya, as described in the Bh\u0101gavatam; are one and the same. They are all\nbhakti-yoga. He said, therefore, that only the less intelligent class of men\nmake a distinction between s\u0101\u1e45khya-yoga and bhakti-yoga.\n\n\nOf course, atheistic s\u0101\u1e45khya-yoga has nothing to do with bhakti-yoga, yet the\nunintelligent claim that the atheistic s\u0101\u1e45khya-yoga is referred to in the\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.\n\n\nOne should therefore understand that buddhi-yoga means to work in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness, in the full bliss and knowledge of devotional service. One who\nworks for the satisfaction of the Lord only, however difficult such work may be,\nis working under the principles of buddhi-yoga and finds himself always in\ntranscendental bliss. By such transcendental engagement, one achieves all\ntranscendental qualities automatically, by the grace of the Lord, and thus his\nliberation is complete in itself, without his making extraneous endeavors to\nacquire knowledge. There is much difference between work in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness\nand work for fruitive results, especially in the matter of sense gratification\nfor achieving results in terms of family or material happiness. Buddhi-yoga is\ntherefore the transcendental quality of the work that we perform.\n\n\n2.40\n\n\nneh\u0101bhikrama-n\u0101\u015bo \u2019sti\n\n\npratyav\u0101yo na vidyate\n\n\nsv-alpam apy asya dharmasya\n\n\ntr\u0101yate mahato bhay\u0101t\n\n\nna\u2014there is not; iha\u2014in this world; abhikrama\u2014endeavoring; n\u0101\u015ba\u1e25\u2014loss;\nasti\u2014there is; pratyav\u0101ya\u1e25\u2014diminution; na\u2014never; vidyate\u2014there is;\nsvalpam\u2014little; api\u2014although; asya\u2014of this; dharmasya\u2014of this occupation;\ntr\u0101yate\u2014releases; mahata\u1e25\u2014of very great; bhay\u0101t\u2014from danger.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nIn this endeavor there is no loss or diminution, and a little advancement on\nthis path can protect one from the most dangerous type of fear.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nActivity in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, or acting for the benefit of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a without\nexpectation of sense gratification, is the highest transcendental quality of\nwork. Even a small beginning of such activity finds no impediment, nor can that\nsmall beginning be lost at any stage. Any work begun on the material plane has\nto be completed, otherwise the whole attempt becomes a failure. But any work\nbegun in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness has a permanent effect, even though not finished.\nThe performer of such work is therefore not at a loss even if his work in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness is incomplete. One percent done in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness bears\npermanent results, so that the next beginning is from the point of two percent;\nwhereas, in material activity, without a hundred percent success, there is no\nprofit. Aj\u0101mila performed his duty in some percentage of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness,\nbut the result he enjoyed at the end was a hundred percent, by the grace of the\nLord. There is a nice verse in this connection in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam:\n\n\ntyaktv\u0101 sva-dharma\u1e41 cara\u1e47\u0101mbuja\u1e41 harer bhajan na pakko \u2019tha patet tato yadi\nyatra kva v\u0101bhadram abh\u016bd amu\u1e63ya ki\u1e41 ko v\u0101rtha \u0101pto \u2019bhajat\u0101\u1e41 sva-dharmata\u1e25\n\n\n\u201cIf someone gives up self-gratificatory pursuits and works in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness and then falls down on account of not completing his work, what\nloss is there on his part? And, what can one gain if one performs his material\nactivities perfectly?\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 1.5.17) Or, as the Christians say, \u201cWhat profiteth\na man if he gain the whole world yet suffers the loss of his eternal soul?\u201d\n\n\nMaterial activities and their results end with the body. But work in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness carries the person again to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, even after the\nloss of the body. At least one is sure to have a chance in the next life of\nbeing born again as a human being, either in the family of a great cultured\nbr\u0101hma\u1e47a or in a rich aristocratic family that will give one a further chance\nfor elevation. That is the unique quality of work done in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\n\n\n2.41\n\n\nvyavas\u0101y\u0101tmik\u0101 buddhir\n\n\nekeha kuru-nandana\n\n\nbahu-\u015b\u0101kh\u0101 hy anant\u0101\u015b ca\n\n\nbuddhayo \u2019vyavas\u0101yin\u0101m\n\n\nvyavas\u0101y\u0101tmik\u0101\u2014resolute K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness; buddhi\u1e25\u2014intelligence; ek\u0101\u2014only one;\niha\u2014in this world; kuru-nandana\u2014O beloved child of the Kurus;\nbahu-\u015b\u0101kh\u0101\u1e25\u2014various branches; hi\u2014indeed; anant\u0101\u1e25\u2014unlimited; ca\u2014also;\nbuddhaya\u1e25\u2014intelligence; avyavas\u0101yin\u0101m\u2014of those who are not in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThose who are on this path are resolute in purpose, and their aim is one.

When one is engaged in the\nduties of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, he need not act in relationship to the material\nworld with obligations to family traditions, humanity, or nationality. Fruitive\nactivities are the engagements of one\u2019s reactions from past good or bad deeds.\nWhen one is awake in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, he need no longer endeavor for good\nresults in his activities. When one is situated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, all\nactivities are on the absolute plane, for they are no longer subject to\ndualities like good and bad. The highest perfection of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is\nrenunciation of the material conception of life. This state is automatically\nachieved by progressive K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. The resolute purpose of a person in\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is based on knowledge (\u201cV\u0101sudeva\u1e25 sarvam iti sa mah\u0101tm\u0101\nsudurlabha\u1e25\u201d) by which one comes to know perfectly that V\u0101sudeva, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is\nthe root of all manifested causes. As water on the root of a tree is\nautomatically distributed to the leaves and branches, in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness,\none can render the highest service to everyone\u2014namely self, family, society,\ncountry, humanity, etc. If K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is satisfied by one\u2019s actions, then everyone\nwill be satisfied.\n\n\nService in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is, however, best practiced under the able\nguidance of a spiritual master who is a bona fide representative of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who\nknows the nature of the student and who can guide him to act in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness. As such, to be well-versed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness one has to act\nfirmly and obey the representative of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and one should accept the\ninstruction of the bona fide spiritual master as one\u2019s mission in life. \u015ar\u012bla\nVi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kur instructs us, in his famous prayers for the\nspiritual master, as follows:\n\n\nyasya pras\u0101d\u0101d bhagavat-pras\u0101do yasy\u0101pras\u0101d\u0101nna gati\u1e25 kuto \u2019pi dhy\u0101ya\u1e41 stuva\u1e41s\ntasya ya\u015bas tri-sandhya\u1e41 vande guro\u1e25 \u015br\u012b-cara\u1e47\u0101ravindam.\n\n\n\u201cBy satisfaction of the spiritual master, the Supreme Personality of Godhead\nbecomes satisfied. And by not satisfying the spiritual master, there is no\nchance of being promoted to the plane of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. I should,\ntherefore, meditate and pray for his mercy three times a day, and offer my\nrespectful obeisances unto him, my spiritual master.\u201d\n\n\nThe whole process, however, depends on perfect knowledge of the soul beyond the\nconception of the body\u2014not theoretically but practically, when there is no\nlonger chance for sense gratification manifested in fruitive activities.

Being desirous of sense gratification\nand opulent life, they say that there is nothing more than this.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nPeople in general are not very intelligent, and due to their ignorance they are\nmost attached to the fruitive activities recommended in the karma-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da portions\nof the Vedas. They do not want anything more than sense gratificatory proposals\nfor enjoying life in heaven, where wine and women are available and material\nopulence is very common. In the Vedas many sacrifices are recommended for\nelevation to the heavenly planets, especially the jyoti\u1e63\u1e6doma sacrifices. In\nfact, it is stated that anyone desiring elevation to heavenly planets must\nperform these sacrifices, and men with a poor fund of knowledge think that this\nis the whole purpose of Vedic wisdom. It is very difficult for such\ninexperienced persons to be situated in the determined action of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness. As fools are attached to the flowers of poisonous trees without\nknowing the results of such attractions, similarly unenlightened men are\nattracted by such heavenly opulence and the sense enjoyment thereof.\n\n\nIn the karma-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da section of the Vedas it is said that those who perform the\nfour monthly penances become eligible to drink the somarasa beverages to become\nimmortal and happy forever. Even on this earth some are very eager to have\nsomarasa to become strong and fit to enjoy sense gratifications. Such persons\nhave no faith in liberation from material bondage, and they are very much\nattached to the pompous ceremonies of Vedic sacrifices. They are generally\nsensual, and they do not want anything other than the heavenly pleasures of\nlife. It is understood that there are gardens called nandana-k\u0101nana in which\nthere is good opportunity for association with angelic, beautiful women and\nhaving a profuse supply of somarasa wine. Such bodily happiness is certainly\nsensual; therefore there are those who are purely attached to material,\ntemporary happiness, as lords of the material world.\n\n\n2.44\n\n\nbhogai\u015bvarya-prasakt\u0101n\u0101\u1e41\n\n\ntay\u0101pah\u1e5bta-cetas\u0101m\n\n\nvyavas\u0101y\u0101tmik\u0101 buddhi\u1e25\n\n\nsam\u0101dhau na vidh\u012byate\n\n\nbhoga\u2014material enjoyment; ai\u015bvarya\u2014opulence; prasakt\u0101n\u0101m\u2014those who are so\nattached; tay\u0101\u2014by such things; apah\u1e5bta-cetas\u0101m\u2014bewildered in mind;\nvyavas\u0101y\u0101tmik\u0101\u2014fixed determination; buddhi\u1e25\u2014devotional service of the Lord;\nsam\u0101dhau\u2014in the controlled mind; na\u2014never; vidh\u012byate\u2014does take place.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nIn the minds of those who are too attached to sense enjoyment and material\nopulence, and who are bewildered by such things, the resolute determination of\ndevotional service to the Supreme Lord does not take place.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nSam\u0101dhi means \u201cfixed mind.\u201d The Vedic dictionary, the Nirukti, says, samyag\n\u0101dh\u012byate \u2019sminn \u0101tmatattva-y\u0101th\u0101tmyam: \u201cWhen the mind is fixed for understanding\nthe self, it is called sam\u0101dhi. \u201cSam\u0101dhi is never possible for persons\ninterested in material sense enjoyment, nor for those who are bewildered by such\ntemporary things.

Be transcendental to all of them. Be free from\nall dualities and from all anxieties for gain and safety, and be established in\nthe Self.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nAll material activities involve actions and reactions in the three modes of\nmaterial nature. They are meant for fruitive results, which cause bondage in the\nmaterial world. The Vedas deal mostly with fruitive activities to gradually\nelevate the general public from the field of sense gratification to a position\non the transcendental plane. Arjuna, as a student and friend of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is\nadvised to raise himself to the transcendental position of Ved\u0101nta philosophy\nwhere, in the beginning, there is brahma-jij\u00f1\u0101s\u0101, or questions on the Supreme\nTranscendence. All the living entities who are in the material world are\nstruggling very hard for existence. For them the Lord, after creation of the\nmaterial world, gave the Vedic wisdom advising how to live and get rid of the\nmaterial entanglement. When the activities for sense gratification, namely the\nkarma-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da chapter, are finished, then the chance for spiritual realization is\noffered in the form of the Upani\u1e63ads, which are part of different Vedas, as the\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is a part of the fifth Veda, namely the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata. The Upani\u1e63ads\nmark the beginning of transcendental life.\n\n\nAs long as the material body exists, there are actions and reactions in the\nmaterial modes. One has to learn tolerance in the face of dualities such as\nhappiness and distress, or cold and warmth, and by tolerating such dualities\nbecome free from anxieties regarding gain and loss. This transcendental position\nis achieved in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness when one is fully dependant on the good\nwill of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.### 2.46\n\n\ny\u0101v\u0101n artha udap\u0101ne\n\n\nsarvata\u1e25 samplutodake\n\n\nt\u0101v\u0101n sarve\u1e63u vede\u1e63u\n\n\nbr\u0101hma\u1e47asya vij\u0101nata\u1e25\n\n\ny\u0101v\u0101n\u2014all that; artha\u1e25\u2014is meant; udap\u0101ne\u2014in a well of water; sarvata\u1e25\u2014in all\nrespects; sampluta-udake\u2014in a great reservoir of water; t\u0101v\u0101n\u2014similarly;\nsarve\u1e63u\u2014in all; vede\u1e63u\u2014Vedic literatures; br\u0101hma\u1e47asya\u2014of the man who knows the\nSupreme Brahman; vij\u0101nata\u1e25\u2014of one who is in complete knowledge.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nAll purposes that are served by the small pond can at once be served by the\ngreat reservoirs of water. Similarly, all the purposes of the Vedas can be\nserved to one who knows the purpose behind them.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe rituals and sacrifices mentioned in the karma-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da division of the Vedic\nliterature are to encourage gradual development of self-realization. And the\npurpose of self-realization is clearly stated in the Fifteenth Chapter of the\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (15.15): the purpose of studying the Vedas is to know Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a,\nthe primeval cause of everything. So, self-realization means understanding K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nand one\u2019s eternal relationship with Him. The relationship of the living entities\nwith K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is also mentioned in the Fifteenth Chapter of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. The\nliving entities are parts and parcels of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; therefore, revival of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness by the individual living entity is the highest perfectional stage\nof Vedic knowledge. This is confirmed in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (3.33.7) as\nfollows:\n\n\naho bata \u015bvapaco\u2019to gar\u012by\u0101n yaj-jihv\u0101gre vartate n\u0101ma tubhyam tepus tapas te\njuhuvu\u1e25 sasnur \u0101ry\u0101 brahm\u0101n\u016bcur n\u0101ma g\u1e5b\u1e47anti ye te.\n\n\n\u201cO my Lord, a person who is chanting Your holy name, although born of a low\nfamily like that of a c\u0101\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101la [dog eater], is situated on the highest platform\nof self-realization. Such a person must have performed all kinds of penances and\nsacrifices according to Vedic rituals and studied the Vedic literatures many,\nmany times after taking his bath in all the holy places of pilgrimage. Such a\nperson is considered to be the best of the \u0100ryan family.\u201d So one must be\nintelligent enough to understand the purpose of the Vedas, without being\nattached to the rituals only, and must not desire to be elevated to the heavenly\nkingdoms for a better quality of sense gratification. It is not possible for the\ncommon man in this age to follow all the rules and regulations of the Vedic\nrituals and the injunctions of the Ved\u0101ntas and the Upani\u1e63ads. It requires much\ntime, energy, knowledge and resources to execute the purposes of the Vedas. This\nis hardly possible in this age. The best purpose of Vedic culture is served,\nhowever, by chanting the holy name of the Lord, as recommended by Lord Caitanya,\nthe deliverer of all fallen souls. When Lord Caitanya was asked by a great Vedic\nscholar, Prak\u0101\u015b\u0101nanda Sarasvat\u012b, why He, the Lord, was chanting the holy name of\nthe Lord like a sentimentalist instead of studying Ved\u0101nta philosophy, the Lord\nreplied that His spiritual master found Him to be a great fool, and thus he\nasked Him to chant the holy name of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He did so, and became ecstatic\nlike a madman. In this age of Kali, most of the population is foolish and not\nadequately educated to understand Ved\u0101nta philosophy; the best purpose of\nVed\u0101nta philosophy is served by inoffensively chanting the holy name of the\nLord. Ved\u0101nta is the last word in Vedic wisdom, and the author and knower of the\nVed\u0101nta philosophy is Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; and the highest Vedantist is the great soul\nwho takes pleasure in chanting the holy name of the Lord. That is the ultimate\npurpose of all Vedic mysticism.\n\n\n2.47\n\n\nkarma\u1e47y ev\u0101dhik\u0101ras te\n\n\nm\u0101 phale\u1e63u kad\u0101cana\n\n\nm\u0101 karma-phala-hetur bh\u016br\n\n\nm\u0101 te sa\u1e45go \u2019stv akarma\u1e47i\n\n\nkarma\u1e47i\u2014prescribed duties; eva\u2014certainly; adhik\u0101ra\u1e25\u2014right; te\u2014of you; m\u0101\u2014never;\nphale\u1e63u\u2014in the fruits; kad\u0101cana\u2014at any time; m\u0101\u2014never; karma-phala\u2014in the result\nof the work; hetu\u1e25\u2014cause; bh\u016b\u1e25\u2014become; m\u0101\u2014never; te\u2014of you; sa\u1e45ga\u1e25\u2014attachment;\nastu\u2014be there; akarma\u1e47i\u2014in not doing.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nYou have a right to perform your prescribed duty, but you are not entitled to\nthe fruits of action. Never consider yourself to be the cause of the results of\nyour activities, and never be attached to not doing your duty.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThere are three considerations here: prescribed duties, capricious work, and\ninaction. Prescribed duties refer to activities performed while one is in the\nmodes of material nature. Capricious work means actions without the sanction of\nauthority, and inaction means not performing one\u2019s prescribed duties. The Lord\nadvised that Arjuna not be inactive, but that he perform his prescribed duty\nwithout being attached to the result. One who is attached to the result of his\nwork is also the cause of the action. Thus he is the enjoyer or sufferer of the\nresult of such actions.\n\n\nAs far as prescribed duties are concerned, they can be fitted into three\nsubdivisions, namely routine work, emergency work and desired activities.\nRoutine work, in terms of the scriptural injunctions, is done without desire for\nresults. As one has to do it, obligatory work is action in the mode of goodness.\nWork with results becomes the cause of bondage; therefore such work is not\nauspicious. Everyone has his proprietory right in regard to prescribed duties,\nbut should act without attachment to the result; such disinterested obligatory\nduties doubtlessly lead one to the path of liberation.\n\n\nArjuna was therefore advised by the Lord to fight as a matter of duty without\nattachment to the result. His nonparticipation in the battle is another side of\nattachment. Such attachment never leads one to the path of salvation. Any\nattachment, positive or negative, is cause for bondage. Inaction is sinful.\nTherefore, fighting as a matter of duty was the only auspicious path of\nsalvation for Arjuna.\n\n\n2.48\n\n\nyoga-stha\u1e25 kuru karm\u0101\u1e47i\n\n\nsa\u1e45ga\u1e41 tyaktv\u0101 dhana\u00f1jaya\n\n\nsiddhy-asiddhyo\u1e25 samo bh\u016btv\u0101\n\n\nsamatva\u1e41 yoga ucyate\n\n\nyoga-stha\u1e25\u2014steadfast in yoga; kuru\u2014perform; karm\u0101\u1e47i\u2014your duty;\nsa\u1e45gam\u2014attachment; tyaktv\u0101\u2014having abandoned; dhana\u00f1jaya\u2014O Dhana\u00f1jaya;\nsiddhi-asiddhyo\u1e25\u2014in success and failure; sama\u1e25\u2014the same; bh\u016btv\u0101\u2014having become;\nsamatvam\u2014evenness of mind; yoga\u1e25\u2014yoga; ucyate\u2014is called.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nBe steadfast in yoga, O Arjuna. Perform your duty and abandon all attachment to\nsuccess or failure. Such evenness of mind is called yoga.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a tells Arjuna that he should act in yoga. And what is that yoga? Yoga means\nto concentrate the mind upon the Supreme by controlling the ever-disturbing\nsenses. And who is the Supreme? The Supreme is the Lord. And because He Himself\nis telling Arjuna to fight, Arjuna has nothing to do with the results of the\nfight. Gain or victory are K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s concern; Arjuna is simply advised to act\naccording to the dictation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The following of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s dictation is real\nyoga, and this is practiced in the process called K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. By K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness only can one give up the sense of proprietorship. One has to\nbecome the servant of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or the servant of the servant of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. That is the\nright way to discharge duty in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, which alone can help one to\nact in yoga.\n\n\nArjuna is a k\u1e63atriya, and as such he is participating in the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma\ninstitution. It is said in the Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Pura\u1e47a that in the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma, the\nwhole aim is to satisfy Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. No one should satisfy himself, as is the rule in\nthe material world, but one should satisfy K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. So, unless one satisfies\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one cannot correctly observe the principles of var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma.\nIndirectly, Arjuna was advised to act as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a told him.\n\n\n2.49\n\n\nd\u016bre\u1e47a hy avara\u1e41 karma\n\n\nbuddhi-yog\u0101d dhana\u00f1jaya\n\n\nbuddhau \u015bara\u1e47am anviccha\n\n\nk\u1e5bpa\u1e47\u0101\u1e25 phala-hetava\u1e25\n\n\nd\u016bre\u1e47a\u2014by discarding it at a long distance; hi\u2014certainly; avaram\u2014abominable;\nkarma\u2014activities; buddhi-yog\u0101t\u2014on the strength of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness;\ndhana\u00f1jaya\u2014O conqueror of wealth; buddhau\u2014in such consciousness; \u015bara\u1e47am\u2014full\nsurrender; anviccha\u2014desire; k\u1e5bpa\u1e47\u0101\u1e25\u2014the misers; phala-hetava\u1e25\u2014those desiring\nfruitive action.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nO Dhana\u00f1jaya, rid yourself of all fruitive activities by devotional service, and\nsurrender fully to that consciousness. Those who want to enjoy the fruits of\ntheir work are misers.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nOne who has actually come to understand one\u2019s constitutional position as the\neternal servitor of the Lord gives up all engagements save working in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness. As already explained, buddhi-yoga means transcendental loving\nservice to the Lord. Such devotional service is the right course of action for\nthe living entity. Only misers desire to enjoy the fruit of their own work just\nto be further entangled in material bondage. Except for work in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness, all activities are abominable because they continually bind the\nworker to the cycle of birth and death. One should therefore never desire to be\nthe cause of work. Everything should be done in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness for the\nsatisfaction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Misers do not know how to utilize the assets of riches\nwhich they acquire by good fortune or by hard labor. One should spend all\nenergies working in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, and that will make one\u2019s life\nsuccessful.

The Bh\u0101gavatam says:\n\n\nsam\u0101\u015brit\u0101 ye padapallava-plava\u1e41 mahat-pada\u1e41 pu\u1e47ya-ya\u015bo mur\u0101re\u1e25 bh\u0101vambudhir\nvatsa-pada\u1e41 para\u1e41 pada\u1e41 para\u1e41 pada\u1e41 yad vipad\u0101\u1e41 na te\u1e63\u0101m\n\n\n(Bh\u0101g. 10.14.58)\n\n\n\u201cFor one who has accepted the boat of the lotus feet of the Lord, who is the\nshelter of the cosmic manifestation and is famous as Mukunda or the giver of\nmukti, the ocean of the material world is like the water contained in a calf\u2019s\nhoofprint. Param padam, or the place where there are no material miseries, or\nVaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha, is his goal, not the place where there is danger in every step of\nlife.\u201d\n\n\nOwing to ignorance, one does not know that this material world is a miserable\nplace where there are dangers at every step. Out of ignorance only, less\nintelligent persons try to adjust to the situation by fruitive activities,\nthinking that resultant actions will make them happy. They do not know that no\nkind of material body anywhere within the universe can give life without\nmiseries. The miseries of life, namely birth, death, old age and diseases, are\npresent everywhere within the material world. But one who understands his real\nconstitutional position as the eternal servitor of the Lord, and thus knows the\nposition of the Personality of Godhead, engages himself in the transcendental\nloving service of the Lord. Consequently he becomes qualified to enter into the\nVaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets, where there is neither material, miserable life, nor the\ninfluence of time and death. To know one\u2019s constitutional position means to know\nalso the sublime position of the Lord. One who wrongly thinks that the living\nentity\u2019s position and the Lord\u2019s position are on the same level is to be\nunderstood to be in darkness and therefore unable to engage himself in the\ndevotional service of the Lord. He becomes a lord himself and thus paves the way\nfor the repetition of birth and death. But one who, understanding that his\nposition is to serve, transfers himself to the service of the Lord, at once\nbecomes eligible for Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhaloka. Service for the cause of the Lord is called\nkarma-yoga or buddhi-yoga, or in plain words, devotional service to the Lord.\n\n\n2.52\n\n\nyad\u0101 te moha-kalila\u1e41\n\n\nbuddhir vyatitari\u1e63yati\n\n\ntad\u0101 gant\u0101si nirveda\u1e41\n\n\n\u015brotavyasya \u015brutasya ca\n\n\nyad\u0101\u2014when; te\u2014your; moha\u2014illusory; kalilam\u2014dense forest; buddhi\u1e25\u2014transcendental\nservice with intelligence; vyatitari\u1e63yati\u2014surpasses; tad\u0101\u2014at that time;\ngant\u0101si\u2014you shall go; nirvedam\u2014callousness; \u015brotavyasya\u2014all that is to be heard;\n\u015brutasya\u2014all that is already heard; ca\u2014also.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nWhen your intelligence has passed out of the dense forest of delusion, you shall\nbecome indifferent to all that has been heard and all that is to be heard.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThere are many good examples in the lives of the great devotees of the Lord of\nthose who became indifferent to the rituals of the Vedas simply by devotional\nservice to the Lord. When a person factually understands K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and his\nrelationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he naturally becomes completely indifferent to the\nrituals of fruitive activities, even though an experienced br\u0101hma\u1e47a. \u015ar\u012b\nM\u0101dhavendra Pur\u012b, a great devotee and \u0101c\u0101rya in the line of the devotees, says:\n\n\nsandhy\u0101-vandana bhadram astu bhavato bho\u1e25 sn\u0101na tubhya\u1e41 namo bho dev\u0101\u1e25 pitara\u015b\nca tarpa\u1e47a-vidhau n\u0101ha\u1e41 k\u1e63ama\u1e25 k\u1e63amyat\u0101m yatra kv\u0101pi ni\u1e63adya y\u0101dava-kulottamasya\nka\u1e41sa-dvi\u1e63a\u1e25 sm\u0101ra\u1e41 sm\u0101ram agha\u1e41 har\u0101mi tad ala\u1e41 manye kim anyena me.\n\n\n\u201cO Lord, in my prayers three times a day, all glory to You.

I think this is sufficient for me.\u201d\n\n\nThe Vedic rites and rituals are imperative for neophytes: comprehending all\nkinds of prayer three times a day, taking a bath early in the morning, offering\nrespects to the forefathers, etc. But, when one is fully in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness\nand is engaged in His transcendental loving service, one becomes indifferent to\nall these regulative principles because he has already attained perfection. If\none can reach the platform of understanding by service to the Supreme Lord\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he has no longer to execute different types of penances and sacrifices as\nrecommended in revealed scriptures. And, similarly, if one has not understood\nthat the purpose of the Vedas is to reach K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and simply engages in the\nrituals, etc., then he is uselessly wasting time in such engagements. Persons in\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness transcend the limit of \u015babda-brahma, or the range of the\nVedas and Upani\u1e63ads.\n\n\n2.53\n\n\n\u015bruti-vipratipann\u0101 te\n\n\nyad\u0101 sth\u0101syati ni\u015bcal\u0101\n\n\nsam\u0101dh\u0101v acal\u0101 buddhis\n\n\ntad\u0101 yogam av\u0101psyasi\n\n\n\u015bruti\u2014Vedic revelation; vipratipann\u0101\u2014without being influenced by the fruitive\nresults of the Vedas; te\u2014your; yad\u0101\u2014when; sth\u0101syati\u2014remains; ni\u015bcal\u0101\u2014unmoved;\nsam\u0101dhau\u2014in transcendental consciousness, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness;\nacal\u0101\u2014unflinching; buddhi\u1e25\u2014intelligence; tad\u0101\u2014at that time;\nyogam\u2014self-realization; av\u0101psyasi\u2014you will achieve.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nWhen your mind is no longer disturbed by the flowery language of the Vedas, and\nwhen it remains fixed in the trance of self-realization, then you will have\nattained the Divine consciousness.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nTo say that one is in sam\u0101dhi is to say that one has fully realized K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness; that is, one in full sam\u0101dhi has realized Brahman, Param\u0101tm\u0101 and\nBhagav\u0101n.

Most important is how\nthe man in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness speaks, for speech is the most important quality\nof any man. It is said that a fool is undiscovered as long as he does not speak,\nand certainly a well-dressed fool cannot be identified unless he speaks, but as\nsoon as he speaks, he reveals himself at once.

Consequently, it is rightly said herein that one has to give up all\nkinds of sense desire manufactured by mental concoction. Artificially, such\nsense desires cannot be stopped. But if one is engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness,\nthen, automatically, sense desires subside without extraneous efforts.\nTherefore, one has to engage himself in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness without hesitation,\nfor this devotional service will instantly help one on to the platform of\ntranscendental consciousness. The highly developed soul always remains satisfied\nin himself by realizing himself as the eternal servitor of the Supreme Lord.\nSuch a transcendentally situated person has no sense desires resulting from\npetty materialism; rather, he remains always happy in his natural position of\neternally serving the Supreme Lord.\n\n\n2.56\n\n\ndu\u1e25khe\u1e63v anudvigna-man\u0101\u1e25\n\n\nsukhe\u1e63u vigata-sp\u1e5bha\u1e25\n\n\nv\u012bta-r\u0101ga-bhaya-krodha\u1e25\n\n\nsthita-dh\u012br munir ucyate\n\n\ndu\u1e25khe\u1e63u\u2014in the threefold miseries; anudvigna-man\u0101\u1e25\u2014without being agitated in\nmind; sukhe\u1e63u\u2014in happiness; vigata-sp\u1e5bha\u1e25\u2014without being too interested;\nv\u012bta\u2014free from; r\u0101ga\u2014attachment; bhaya\u2014fear; krodha\u1e25\u2014anger; sthita-dh\u012b\u1e25\u2014one who\nis steady; muni\u1e25\u2014sage; ucyate\u2014is called.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nOne who is not disturbed in spite of the threefold miseries, who is not elated\nwhen there is happiness, and who is free from attachment, fear and anger, is\ncalled a sage of steady mind.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe word muni means one who can agitate his mind in various ways for mental\nspeculation without coming to a factual conclusion. It is said that every muni\nhas a different angle of vision, and unless a muni differs from other munis, he\ncannot be called a muni in the strict sense of the term. N\u0101sau munir yasya mata\u1e41\nna binnam. But a sthita-dh\u012b-muni as mentioned herein by the Lord, is different\nfrom an ordinary muni The sthita-dh\u012b-muni is always in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, for\nhe has exhausted all his business of creative speculation. He has surpassed the\nstage of mental speculations and has come to the conclusion that Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a,\nor V\u0101sudeva, is everything. He is called a muni fixed in mind. Such a fully\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person is not at all disturbed by the onslaughts of the\nthreefold miseries, for he accepts all miseries as the mercy of the Lord,\nthinking himself only worthy of more trouble due to his past misdeeds; and he\nsees that his miseries, by the grace of the Lord, are minimized to the lowest.\nSimilarly, when he is happy he gives credit to the Lord, thinking himself\nunworthy of the happiness; he realizes that it is due only to the Lord\u2019s grace\nthat he is in such a comfortable condition and able to render better service to\nthe Lord. And, for the service of the Lord, he is always daring and active and\nis not influenced by attachment or aversion. Attachment means accepting things\nfor one\u2019s own sense gratification, and detachment is the absence of such sensual\nattachment. But one fixed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness has neither attachment nor\ndetachment because his life is dedicated in the service of the Lord.\nConsequently he is not at all angry even when his attempts are unsuccessful.

Most people, however, are servants of the\nsenses and are thus directed by the dictation of the senses. That is the answer\nto the question as to how the yog\u012b is situated. The senses are compared to\nvenomous serpents. They want to act very loosely and without restriction. The\nyog\u012b, or the devotee, must be very strong to control the serpents\u2014like a snake\ncharmer. He never allows them to act independantly. There are many injunctions\nin the revealed scriptures; some of them are do-not\u2019s, and some of them are\ndo\u2019s. Unless one is able to follow the do\u2019s and the do-not\u2019s, restricting\noneself from sense enjoyment, it is not possible to be firmly fixed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness. The best example, set herein, is the tortoise. The tortoise can\nat any moment wind up his senses and exhibit them again at any time for\nparticular purposes. Similarly, the senses of the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious persons are\nused only for some particular purpose in the service of the Lord and are\nwithdrawn otherwise. Keeping the senses always in the service of the Lord is the\nexample set by the analogy of the tortoise, who keeps the senses within.\n\n\n2.59\n\n\nvi\u1e63ay\u0101 vinivartante\n\n\nnir\u0101h\u0101rasya dehina\u1e25\n\n\nrasa-varja\u1e41 raso \u2019py asya\n\n\npara\u1e41 d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dv\u0101 nivartate\n\n\nvi\u1e63ay\u0101\u1e25\u2014objects for sense enjoyment; vinivartante\u2014are practiced to be refrained\nfrom; nir\u0101h\u0101rasya\u2014by negative restrictions; dehina\u1e25\u2014for the embodied;\nrasa-varjam\u2014giving up the taste; rasa\u1e25\u2014sense of enjoyment; api\u2014although there\nis; asya\u2014his; param\u2014far superior things; d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dv\u0101\u2014by experiencing;\nnivartate\u2014ceases from.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThe embodied soul may be restricted from sense enjoyment, though the taste for\nsense objects remains. But, ceasing such engagements by experiencing a higher\ntaste, he is fixed in consciousness.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nUnless one is transcendentally situated, it is not possible to cease from sense\nenjoyment. The process of restriction from sense enjoyment by rules and\nregulations is something like restricting a diseased person from certain types\nof eatables. The patient, however, neither likes such restrictions, nor loses\nhis taste for eatables. Similarly, sense restriction by some spiritual process\nlike a\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45ga-yoga, in the matter of yama, niyama, \u0101sana, pr\u0101\u1e47\u0101y\u0101ma, praty\u0101h\u0101ra,\ndhara\u1e47\u0101, dhy\u0101na, etc., is recommended for less intelligent persons who have no\nbetter knowledge. But one who has tasted the beauty of the Supreme Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a,\nin the course of his advancement in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, no longer has a taste\nfor dead material things. Therefore, restrictions are there for the less\nintelligent neophytes in the spiritual advancement of life, but such\nrestrictions are only good if one actually has a taste for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\nWhen one is actually K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, he automatically loses his taste for pale\nthings.\n\n\n2.60\n\n\nyatato hy api kaunteya\n\n\npuru\u1e63asya vipa\u015bcita\u1e25\n\n\nindriy\u0101\u1e47i pram\u0101th\u012bni\n\n\nharanti prasabha\u1e41 mana\u1e25\n\n\nyatata\u1e25\u2014while endeavoring; hi\u2014certainly; api\u2014in spite of; kaunteya\u2014O son of\nKunt\u012b; puru\u1e63asya\u2014of the man; vipa\u015bcita\u1e25\u2014full of discriminating knowledge;\nindriy\u0101\u1e47i\u2014the senses; pram\u0101th\u012bni\u2014stimulated; haranti\u2014throws forcefully;\nprasabha\u1e41\u2014by force; mana\u1e25\u2014the mind.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThe senses are so strong and impetuous, O Arjuna, that they forcibly carry away\nthe mind even of a man of discrimination who is endeavoring to control them.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThere are many learned sages, philosophers and transcendentalists who try to\nconquer the senses, but in spite of their endeavors, even the greatest of them\nsometimes fall victim to material sense enjoyment due to the agitated mind. Even\nVi\u015bv\u0101mitra, a great sage and perfect yog\u012b, was misled by Menak\u0101 into sex\nenjoyment, although the yog\u012b was endeavoring for sense control with severe types\nof penance and yoga practice. And,of course, there are so many similar instances\nin the history of the world. Therefore, it is very difficult to control the mind\nand the senses without being fully K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious. Without engaging the mind in\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one cannot cease such material engagements. A practical example is given\nby \u015ar\u012b Y\u0101mun\u0101c\u0101rya, a great saint and devotee, who says: \u201cSince my mind has been\nengaged in the service of the lotus feet of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and I have been enjoying\nan ever new transcendental humor, whenever I think of sex life with a woman, my\nface at once turns from it, and I spit at the thought.\u201d\n\n\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is such a transcendentally nice thing that automatically\nmaterial enjoyment becomes distasteful. It is as if a hungry man had satisfied\nhis hunger by a sufficient quantity of nutritious eatables. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Ambar\u012b\u1e63a\nalso conquered a great yog\u012b, Durv\u0101s\u0101 Muni, simply because his mind was engaged\nin K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\n\n\n2.61\n\n\nt\u0101ni sarv\u0101\u1e47i sa\u1e41yamya\n\n\nyukta \u0101s\u012bta mat-para\u1e25\n\n\nva\u015be hi yasyendriy\u0101\u1e47i\n\n\ntasya praj\u00f1\u0101 prati\u1e63\u1e6dhit\u0101\n\n\nt\u0101ni\u2014those senses; sarv\u0101\u1e47i\u2014all; sa\u1e41yamya\u2014keeping under control; yukta\u1e25\u2014being\nengaged; \u0101s\u012bta\u2014being so situated; mat-para\u1e25\u2014in relationship with Me; va\u015be\u2014in\nfull subjugation; hi\u2014certainly; yasya\u2014one whose; indriy\u0101\u1e47i\u2014senses; tasya\u2014his;\npraj\u00f1\u0101\u2014consciousness; prati\u1e63\u1e6dhit\u0101\u2014fixed.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nOne who restrains his senses and fixes his consciousness upon Me is known as a\nman of steady intelligence.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThat the highest conception of yoga perfection is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is clearly\nexplained in this verse. And, unless one is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, it is not at all\npossible to control the senses. As cited above, the great sage Durv\u0101s\u0101 Muni\npicked a quarrel with Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Ambar\u012b\u1e63a, and Durv\u0101s\u0101 Muni unnecessarily became\nangry out of pride and therefore could not check his senses. On the other hand,\nthe King, although not as powerful a yog\u012b as the sage, but a devotee of the\nLord, silently tolerated all the sage\u2019s injustices and thereby emerged\nvictorious.

The senses require real engagements, and if\nthey are not engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, they will\ncertainly seek engagement in the service of materialism. In the material world\neveryone, including Lord \u015aiva and Lord Brahm\u0101\u2014to say nothing of other demigods\nin the heavenly planets\u2014is subjected to the influence of sense objects, and the\nonly method to get out of this puzzle of material existence is to become K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconscious. Lord \u015aiva was deep in meditation, but when P\u0101rvat\u012b agitated him for\nsense pleasure, he agreed to the proposal, and as a result K\u0101rtikeya was born.\nWhen Harid\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kur was a young devotee of the Lord, he was similarly allured\nby the incarnation of M\u0101y\u0101 Dev\u012b, but Harid\u0101sa easily passed the test because of\nhis unalloyed devotion to Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. As illustrated in the above-mentioned\nverse of \u015ar\u012b Y\u0101mun\u0101c\u0101rya, a sincere devotee of the Lord shuns all material sense\nenjoyment due to his higher taste for spiritual enjoyment in the association of\nthe Lord. That is the secret of success. One who is not, therefore, in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness, however powerful he may be in controlling the senses by\nartificial repression, is sure ultimately to fail, for the slightest thought of\nsense pleasure will agitate him to gratify his desires.\n\n\n2.63\n\n\nkrodh\u0101d bhavati sammoha\u1e25\n\n\nsammoh\u0101t sm\u1e5bti-vibhrama\u1e25\n\n\nsm\u1e5bti-bhra\u1e41\u015b\u0101d buddhi-n\u0101\u015bo\n\n\nbuddhi-n\u0101\u015b\u0101t pra\u1e47a\u015byati\n\n\nkrodh\u0101t\u2014from anger; bhavati\u2014takes place; sa\u1e41moha\u1e25\u2014perfect illusion;\nsa\u1e41moh\u0101t\u2014from illusion; sm\u1e5bti\u2014of memory; vibhrama\u1e25\u2014bewilderment;\nsm\u1e5bti-bhra\u1e41\u015b\u0101t\u2014after bewilderment of memory; buddhi-n\u0101\u015ba\u1e25\u2014loss of intelligence;\nbuddhi-n\u0101\u015b\u0101t\u2014and from loss of intelligence; pra\u1e47a\u015byati\u2014falls down.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nFrom anger, delusion arises, and from delusion bewilderment of memory.

Those who are without knowledge of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness artificially try to avoid material objects, and as a result,\nalthough they desire liberation from material bondage, they do not attain to the\nperfect stage of renunciation. On the other hand, a person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness knows how to use everything in the service of the Lord; therefore\nhe does not become a victim of material consciousness. For example, for an\nimpersonalist, the Lord, or the Absolute, being impersonal, cannot eat. Whereas\nan impersonalist tries to avoid good eatables, a devotee knows that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the\nsupreme enjoyer and that He eats all that is offered to Him in devotion. So,\nafter offering good eatables to the Lord, the devotee takes the remnants, called\npras\u0101dam. Thus everything becomes spiritualized and there is no danger of a\ndownfall. The devotee takes pras\u0101dam in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, whereas the\nnondevotee rejects it as material. The impersonalist, therefore, cannot enjoy\nlife due to his artificial renunciation; and for this reason, a slight agitation\nof the mind pulls him down again into the pool of material existence. It is said\nthat such a soul, even though rising up to the point of liberation, falls down\nagain due to his not having support in devotional service.\n\n\n2.64\n\n\nr\u0101ga-dve\u1e63a-vimuktais tu\n\n\nvi\u1e63ay\u0101n indriyai\u015b caran\n\n\n\u0101tma-va\u015byair vidhey\u0101tm\u0101\n\n\npras\u0101dam adhigacchati\n\n\nr\u0101ga\u2014attachment; dve\u1e63a\u2014detachment; vimuktai\u1e25\u2014by one who has been free from such\nthings; tu\u2014but; vi\u1e63ay\u0101n\u2014sense objects; indriyai\u1e25\u2014by the senses; caran\u2014acting;\n\u0101tma-va\u015byai\u1e25\u2014one who has control over; vidhey\u0101tm\u0101\u2014one who follows regulated\nfreedom; pras\u0101dam\u2014the mercy of the Lord; adhigacchati\u2014attains.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nOne who can control his senses by practicing the regulated principles of freedom\ncan obtain the complete mercy of the Lord and thus become free from all\nattachment and aversion.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nIt is already explained that one may externally control the senses by some\nartificial process, but unless the senses are engaged in the transcendental\nservice of the Lord, there is every chance of a fall. Although the person in\nfull K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness may apparently be on the sensual plane, because of his\nbeing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, he has no attachment to sensual activities. The K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconscious person is concerned only with the satisfaction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and nothing\nelse. Therefore he is transcendental to all attachment. If K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a wants, the\ndevotee can do anything which is ordinarily undesirable; and if K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a does not\nwant, he shall not do that which he would have ordinarily done for his own\nsatisfaction. Therefore to act or not to act is within his control because he\nacts only under the direction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.

So it is\nconfirmed in the Fifth Chapter (5.29) that when one understands that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is\nthe only enjoyer of all the good results of sacrifice and penance, and that He\nis the proprietor of all universal manifestations, that He is the real friend of\nall living entities, then only can one have real peace. Therefore, if one is not\nin K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, there cannot be a final goal for the mind. Disturbance\nis due to want of an ultimate goal, and when one is certain that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the\nenjoyer, proprietor and friend of everyone and everything, then one can, with a\nsteady mind, bring about peace. Therefore, one who is engaged without a\nrelationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is certainly always in distress and is without peace,\nhowever much one may make a show of peace and spiritual advancement in life.\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is a self-manifested peaceful condition which can be\nachieved only in relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\n\n\n2.67\n\n\nindriy\u0101\u1e47\u0101\u1e41 hi carat\u0101\u1e41\n\n\nyan mano \u2019nuvidh\u012byate\n\n\ntad asya harati praj\u00f1\u0101\u1e41\n\n\nv\u0101yur n\u0101vam iv\u0101mbhasi\n\n\nindriy\u0101\u1e47\u0101m\u2014of the senses; hi\u2014certainly; carat\u0101m\u2014while herding over; yat\u2014that;\nmana\u1e25\u2014mind; anuvidh\u012byate\u2014becomes constantly engaged; tat\u2014that; asya\u2014his;\nharati\u2014takes away; praj\u00f1\u0101m\u2014intelligence; v\u0101yu\u1e25\u2014wind; n\u0101vam\u2014a boat; iva\u2014like;\nambhasi\u2014on the water.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nAs a boat on the water is swept away by a strong wind, even one of the senses on\nwhich the mind focuses can carry away a man\u2019s intelligence.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nUnless all of the senses are engaged in the service of the Lord, even one of\nthem engaged in sense gratification can deviate the devotee from the path of\ntranscendental advancement.

The\nintrospective sage remains alert in the \u201cnight\u201d of the materialistic men. The\nsage feels transcendental pleasure in the gradual advancement of spiritual\nculture, whereas the man in materialistic activities, being asleep to\nself-realization, dreams of varieties of sense pleasure, feeling sometimes happy\nand sometimes distressed in his sleeping condition.

But the ocean\nremains the same\u2014steady; it is not agitated, nor does it cross beyond the limit\nof its brink. That is also true of a person fixed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. As\nlong as one has the material body, the demands of the body for sense\ngratification will continue. The devotee, however, is not disturbed by such\ndesires because of his fullness. A K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious man is not in need of\nanything because the Lord fulfills all his material necessities. Therefore he is\nlike the ocean\u2014always full in himself. Desires may come to him like the waters\nof the rivers that flow into the ocean, but he is steady in his activities, and\nhe is not even slightly disturbed by desires for sense gratification. That is\nthe proof of a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious man\u2014one who has lost all inclinations for\nmaterial sense gratification, although the desires are present. Because he\nremains satisfied in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, he can\nremain steady, like the ocean, and therefore enjoy full peace. Others, however,\nwho fulfill desires even up to the limit of liberation, what to speak of\nmaterial success, never attain peace. The fruitive workers, the salvationists,\nand also the yog\u012bs who are after mystic powers, are all unhappy because of\nunfulfilled desires. But the person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is happy in the\nservice of the Lord, and he has no desires to be fulfilled. In fact, he does not\neven desire liberation from the so-called material bondage. The devotees of\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a have no material desires, and therefore they are in perfect peace.\n\n\n2.71\n\n\nvih\u0101ya k\u0101m\u0101n ya\u1e25 sarv\u0101n\n\n\npum\u0101\u1e41\u015b carati ni\u1e25sp\u1e5bha\u1e25\n\n\nnirmamo niraha\u1e45k\u0101ra\u1e25\n\n\nsa \u015b\u0101ntim adhigacchati\n\n\nvih\u0101ya\u2014after giving up; k\u0101m\u0101n\u2014all material desires for sense gratification;\nya\u1e25\u2014the person; sarv\u0101n\u2014all; pum\u0101n\u2014a person; carati\u2014lives; nih\u1e63p\u1e5bha\u1e25 \u2014desireless;\nnirmama\u1e25\u2014without a sense of proprietorship; niraha\u1e45k\u0101ra\u1e25\u2014without false ego;\nsa\u1e25\u2014all; \u015b\u0101ntim\u2014perfect peace; adhigacchati\u2014attains.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nA person who has given up all desires for sense gratification, who lives free\nfrom desires, who has given up all sense of proprietorship and is devoid of\nfalse ego\u2014he alone can attain real peace.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nTo become desireless means not to desire anything for sense gratification. In\nother words, desire for becoming K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious is actually desirelessness. To\nunderstand one\u2019s actual position as the eternal servitor of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, without\nfalsely claiming this material body to be oneself and without falsely claiming\nproprietorship over anything in the world, is the perfect stage of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness. One who is situated in this perfect stage knows that because\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the proprietor of everything, therefore everything must be used for the\nsatisfaction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Arjuna did not want to fight for his own sense\nsatisfaction, but when he became fully K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious he fought because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nwanted him to fight. For himself there was no desire to fight, but for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a the\nsame Arjuna fought to his best ability. Desire for the satisfaction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is\nreally desirelessness; it is not an artificial attempt to abolish desires. The\nliving entity cannot be desireless or senseless, but he does have to change the\nquality of the desires. A materially desireless person certainly knows that\neverything belongs to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (\u012b\u015b\u0101v\u0101syam ida\u1e41 sarvam), and therefore he does not\nfalsely claim proprietorship over anything. This transcendental knowledge is\nbased on self-realization\u2014namely, knowing perfectly well that every living\nentity is the eternal part and parcel of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in spiritual identity. and\ntherefore the eternal position of the living entity is never on the level of\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or greater than Him. This understanding of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is the\nbasic principle of real peace.\n\n\n2.72\n\n\ne\u1e63\u0101 br\u0101hm\u012b sthiti\u1e25 p\u0101rtha\n\n\nnain\u0101\u1e41 pr\u0101pya vimuhyati\n\n\nsthitv\u0101sy\u0101m anta-k\u0101le \u2019pi\n\n\nbrahma-nirv\u0101\u1e47am \u1e5bcchati\n\n\ne\u1e63\u0101\u2014this; br\u0101hm\u012b\u2014spiritual; sthiti\u1e25\u2014situation; p\u0101rtha\u2014O son of P\u1e5bth\u0101; na\u2014never;\nen\u0101m\u2014this; pr\u0101pya\u2014achieving; vimuhyati\u2014bewilders; sthitv\u0101\u2014being so situated;\nasy\u0101m\u2014being so; anta-k\u0101le\u2014at the end of life; api\u2014also;\nbrahma-nirv\u0101\u1e47am\u2014spiritual (kingdom of God); \u1e5bcchati\u2014attains.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThat is the way of the spiritual and godly life, after attaining which a man is\nnot bewildered. Being so situated, even at the hour of death, one can enter into\nthe kingdom of God.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nOne can attain K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness or divine life at once, within a second\u2014or\none may not attain such a state of life even after millions of births. It is\nonly a matter of understanding and accepting the fact. Kha\u1e6dv\u0101\u1e45ga Mah\u0101r\u0101ja\nattained this state of life just a few minutes before his death, by surrendering\nunto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Nirv\u0101\u1e47a means ending the process of materialistic life. According to\nBuddhist philosophy, there is only void after the completion of this material\nlife, but Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 teaches differently. Actual life begins after the\ncompletion of this material life. For the gross materialist it is sufficient to\nknow that one has to end this materialistic way of life, but for persons who are\nspiritually advanced, there is another life after this materialistic life.\nBefore ending this life, if one fortunately becomes K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, he at once\nattains the stage of Brahma-nirv\u0101\u1e47a. There is no difference between the kingdom\nof God and the devotional service of the Lord. Since both of them are on the\nabsolute plane, to be engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord\nis to have attained the spiritual kingdom. In the material world there are\nactivities of sense gratification, whereas in the spiritual world there are\nactivities of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Attainment of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness even during\nthis life is immediate attainment of Brahman, and one who is situated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness has certainly already entered into the kingdom of God.\n\n\nBrahman is just the opposite of matter. Therefore br\u0101hm\u012b sthiti\u1e25 means \u201cnot on\nthe platform of material activities.\u201d Devotional service of the Lord is accepted\nin the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 as the liberated stage. Therefore, br\u0101hm\u012b-sthiti\u1e25 is\nliberation from material bondage.\n\n\n\u015ar\u012bla Bhaktivinode \u1e6ch\u0101kur has summarized this Second Chapter of the\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 as being the contents for the whole text.

The word\n\u201cMadhus\u016bdana\u201d is significant in this verse.

They do not lead to higher planets, but to infamy.  PURPORT  K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and the Supreme Personality of Godhead are identical. Therefore Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nis referred to as \u201cBhagav\u0101n\u201d throughout the G\u012bt\u0101. Bhagav\u0101n is the ultimate in\nthe Absolute Truth. Absolute Truth is realized in three phases of understanding,\nnamely Brahman or the impersonal all-pervasive spirit; Param\u0101tm\u0101, or the\nlocalized aspect of the Supreme within the heart of all living entities; and\nBhagav\u0101n, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In the\n\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam this conception of the Absolute Truth is explained thus:  vadanti tat tattva-vidas tattva\u1e41 yaj j\u00f1\u0101nam advayam brahmeti param\u0101tmeti\nbhagav\u0101n iti \u015babdyate.  \u201cThe Absolute Truth is realized in three phases of understanding by the knower\nof the Absolute Truth, and all of them are identical. Such phases of the\nAbsolute Truth are expressed as Brahman, Param\u0101tm\u0101, and Bhagav\u0101n.\u201d (Bh\u0101g.\n1.2.11) These three divine aspects can be explained by the example of the sun,\nwhich also has three different aspects, namely the sunshine, the sun\u2019s surface\nand the sun planet itself. One who studies the sunshine only is the preliminary\nstudent. One who understands the sun\u2019s surface is further advanced. And one who\ncan enter into the sun planet is the highest. Ordinary students who are\nsatisfied by simply understanding the sunshine\u2014its universal pervasiveness and\nthe glaring effulgence of its impersonal nature\u2014may be compared to those who can\nrealize only the Brahman feature of the Absolute Truth. The student who has\nadvanced still further can know the sun disc, which is compared to knowledge of\nthe Param\u0101tm\u0101 feature of the Absolute Truth. And the student who can enter into\nthe heart of the sun planet is compared to those who realize the personal\nfeatures of the Supreme Absolute Truth. Therefore, the bhaktas, or the\ntranscendentalists who have realized the Bhagav\u0101n feature of the Absolute Truth,\nare the topmost transcendentalists, although all students who are engaged in the\nstudy of the Absolute Truth are engaged in the same subject matter. The\nsunshine, the sun disc and the inner affairs of the sun planet cannot be\nseparated from one another, and yet the students of the three different phases\nare not in the same category.  The Sanskrit word Bhagav\u0101n is explained by the great authority, Par\u0101\u015bara Muni,\nthe father of Vy\u0101sadeva. The Supreme Personality who possesses all riches, all\nstrength, all fame, all beauty, all knowledge and all renunciation is called\nBhagav\u0101n. There are many persons who are very rich, very powerful, very\nbeautiful, very famous, very learned, and very much detached, but no one can\nclaim that he possesses all riches, all strength, etc., entirely. Only K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can\nclaim this because He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. No living entity,\nincluding Brahm\u0101, Lord \u015aiva, or N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, can possess opulences as fully as\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore it is concluded in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 by Lord Brahm\u0101 himself\nthat Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. No one is equal to or\nabove Him. He is the primeval Lord, or Bhagav\u0101n, known as Govinda, and He is the\nsupreme cause of all causes.  \u012b\u015bvara\u1e25 parama\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u1e25 sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha\u1e25 an\u0101dir \u0101dir govinda\u1e25\nsarua-k\u0101ra\u1e47a-k\u0101ra\u1e47am  \u201cThere are many personalities possessing the qualities of Bhagav\u0101n, but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is\nthe supreme because none can excel Him. He is the Supreme Person, and His body\nis eternal, full of knowledge and bliss. He is the primeval Lord Govinda and the\ncause of all causes.\u201d (Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 5.1)  In the Bh\u0101gavatam also there is a list of many incarnations of the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead, but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is described as the original Personality of\nGodhead, from whom many, many incarnations and Personalities of Godhead expand:  ete c\u0101\u1e41\u015ba-kal\u0101\u1e25 pu\u1e41sa\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47as tu bhagav\u0101n svayam indr\u0101ri-vy\u0101kula\u1e41 loka\u1e41\nm\u1e5b\u1e0dayanti yuge yuge  \u201cAll the lists of the incarnations of Godhead submitted herewith are either\nplenary expansions or parts of the plenary expansions of the Supreme Godhead,\nbut K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself.\u201d (Bhag. 1.3.28)  Therefore, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the original Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Absolute\nTruth, the source of both the Supersoul and the impersonal Brahman.  In the presence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Arjuna\u2019s lamentation for\nhis kinsmen is certainly unbecoming, and therefore K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a expressed His surprise\nwith the word kutas, \u201cwherefrom.\u201d Such unmanly sentiments were never expected\nfrom a person belonging to the civilized class of men known as \u0100ryans. The word\n\u0101ryan is applicable to persons who know the value of life and have a\ncivilization based on spiritual realization. Persons who are led by the material\nconception of life do not know that the aim of life is realization of the\nAbsolute Truth, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, or Bhagav\u0101n, and they are captivated by the external\nfeatures of the material world, and therefore they do not know what liberation\nis. Persons who have no knowledge of liberation from material bondage are called\nnon-\u0100ryans. Although Arjuna was a k\u1e63atriya, he was deviating from his prescribed\nduties by declining to fight. This act of cowardice is described as befitting\nthe non-\u0100ryans. Such deviation from duty does not help one in the progress of\nspiritual life, nor does it even give one the opportunity to become famous in\nthis world. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a did not approve of the so-called compassion of Arjuna for\nhis kinsmen.",

PURPORT  Arjuna was addressed as the \u201cson of P\u1e5bth\u0101,\u201d who happened to be the sister of\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s father Vasudeva. Therefore Arjuna had a blood relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\nIf the son of a ksatriya declines to fight, he is a k\u1e63atriya in name only, and\nif the son of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a acts impiously, he is a br\u0101hma\u1e47a in name only. Such\nk\u1e63atriyas and br\u0101hma\u1e47as are unworthy sons of their fathers; therefore, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a did\nnot want Arjuna to become an unworthy son of a k\u1e63atriya. Arjuna was the most\nintimate friend of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was directly guiding him on the chariot; but\nin spite of all these credits, if Arjuna abandoned the battle, he would be\ncommitting an infamous act; therefore K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a said that such an attitude in Arjuna\ndid not fit his personality. Arjuna might argue that he would give up the battle\non the grounds of his magnanimous attitude for the most respectable Bh\u012b\u1e63ma and\nhis relatives, but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a considered that sort of magnanimity not approved by\nauthority.

The\nsons of Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra, whom if we killed we should not care to live, are now\nstanding before us on this battlefield.  PURPORT  Arjuna did not know whether he should fight and risk unnecessary violence,\nalthough fighting is the duty of the k\u1e63atriyas, or whether he should refrain and\nlive by begging. If he did not conquer the enemy, begging would be his only\nmeans of subsistence. Nor was there certainty of victory, because either side\nmight emerge victorious. Even if victory awaited them (and their cause was\njustified), still, if the sons of Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra died in battle, it would be very\ndifficult to live in their absence. Under the circumstances, that would be\nanother kind of defeat for them. All these considerations by Arjuna definitely\nprove that he was not only a great devotee of the Lord but that he was also\nhighly enlightened and had complete control over his mind and senses. His desire\nto live by begging, although he was born in the royal household, is another sign\nof detachment. He was truly virtuous, as these qualities, combined with his\nfaith in the words of instruction of \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (his spiritual master), indicate.\nIt is concluded that Arjuna was quite fit for liberation. Unless the senses are\ncontrolled, there is no chance of elevation to the platform of knowledge, and\nwithout knowledge and devotion there is no chance of liberation.

Now I\nam Your disciple, and a soul surrendered unto You. Please instruct me.  PURPORT  By nature\u2019s own way the complete system of material activities is a source of\nperplexity for everyone. In every step there is perplexity, and therefore it\nbehooves one to approach a bona fide spiritual master who can give one proper\nguidance for executing the purpose of life. All Vedic literatures advise us to\napproach a bona fide spiritual master to get free from the perplexities of life\nwhich happen without our desire. They are like a forest fire that somehow blazes\nwithout being set by anyone. Similarly, the world situation is such that\nperplexities of life automatically appear, without our wanting such confusion.\nNo one wants fire, and yet it takes place, and we become perplexed. The Vedic\nwisdom therefore advises that in order to solve the perplexities of life and to\nunderstand the science of the solution, one must approach a spiritual master who\nis in the disciplic succession. A person with a bona fide spiritual master is\nsupposed to know everything. One should not, therefore, remain in material\nperplexities but should approach a spiritual master. This is the purport of this\nverse.  Who is the man in material perplexities? It is he who does not understand the\nproblems of life. In the Garga Upani\u1e63ad the perplexed man is described as\nfollows:  yo v\u0101 etad ak\u1e63ara\u1e41 g\u0101rgy aviditv\u0101sm\u0101l lok\u0101t praiti sa k\u1e5bpa\u1e47a\u1e25  \u201cHe is a miserly man who does not solve the problems of life as a human and who\nthus quits this world like the cats and dogs, without understanding the science\nof self-realization.\u201d This human form of life is a most valuable asset for the\nliving entity who can ultilize it for solving the problems of life; therefore,\none who does not utilize this opportunity properly is a miser. On the other\nhand, there is the br\u0101hma\u1e47a, or he who is intelligent enough to utilize this\nbody to solve all the problems of life.  The k\u1e5bpa\u1e47as, or miserly persons, waste their time in being overly affectionate\nfor family, society, country, etc., in the material conception of life. One is\noften attached to family life, namely to wife, children and other members, on\nthe basis of \u201cskin disease.\u201d The k\u1e5bpa\u1e47a thinks that he is able to protect his\nfamily members from death; or the k\u1e5bpa\u1e47a thinks that his family or society can\nsave him from the verge of death. Such family attachment can be found even in\nthe lower animals who take care of children also. Being intelligent, Arjuna\ncould understand that his affection for family members and his wish to protect\nthem from death were the causes ot his perplexities. Although he could\nunderstand that his duty to fight was awaiting him, still, on account of miserly\nweakness, he could not discharge the duties. He is therefore asking Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a,\nthe supreme spiritual master, to make a definite solution. He offers himself to\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as a disciple. He wants to stop friendly talks. Talks between the master\nand the disciple are serious, and now Arjuna wants to talk very seriously before\nthe recognized spiritual master. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is therefore the original spiritual\nmaster of the science of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, and Arjuna is the first disciple for\nunderstanding the G\u012bt\u0101. How Arjuna understands the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is stated in\nthe G\u012bt\u0101 itself. And yet foolish mundane scholars explain that one need not\nsubmit to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as a person, but to \u201cthe unborn within K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u201d There is no\ndifference between K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s within and without. And one who has no sense of this\nunderstanding is the greatest fool in trying to understand Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.",

TRANSLATION  I can find no means to drive away this grief which is drying up my senses. I\nwill not be able to destroy it even if I win an unrivalled kingdom on the earth\nwith sovereignty like the demigods in heaven.  PURPORT  Although Arjuna was putting forward so many arguments based on knowledge of the\nprinciples of religion and moral codes, it appears that he was unable to solve\nhis real problem without the help of the spiritual master, Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He\ncould understand that his so-called knowledge was useless in driving away his\nproblems, which were drying up his whole existence; and it was impossible for\nhim to solve such perplexities without the help of a spiritual master like Lord\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Academic knowledge, scholarship, high position, etc., are all useless in\nsolving the problems of life; help can only be given by a spiritual master like\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore, the conclusion is that a spiritual master who is one hundred\npercent K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious is the bona fide spiritual master, for he can solve the\nproblems of life. Lord Caitanya said that one who is master in the science of\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, regardless of his social position, is the real spiritual\nmaster.  kib\u0101vipra, kib\u0101 ny\u0101s\u012b, \u015b\u016bdra kene naya yei k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-tattva-vett\u0101, sei \u2018guru\u2019 haya.  (Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta, Madhya 8.128)  \u201cIt does not matter whether a person is a vipra [learned scholar in Vedic\nwisdom] or is born in a lower family, or is in the renounced order of life\u2014if he\nis master in the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he is the perfect and bona fide spiritual\nmaster.\u201d So without being a master in the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, no one\nis a bona fide spiritual master. It is also said in Vedic literatures:  \u1e63a\u1e6d-karma-nipu\u1e47o vipro mantra-tantra-vi\u015b\u0101rada\u1e25 avai\u1e63\u1e47avo gurur na sy\u0101d vai\u1e63\u1e47ava\u1e25\n\u015bvapaco guru\u1e25  \u201cA scholarly br\u0101hma\u1e47a, expert in all subjects of Vedic knowledge, is unfit to\nbecome a spiritual master without being a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, or expert in the science of\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. But a person born in a family of a lower caste can become a\nspiritual master if he is a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious.\u201d  The problems of material existence\u2014birth, old age, disease and death\u2014cannot be\ncounteracted by accumulation of wealth and economic development. In many parts\nof the world there are states which are replete with all facilities of life,\nwhich are full of wealth, and economically developed, yet the problems of\nmaterial existence are still present. They are seeking peace in different ways,\nbut they ean achieve real happiness only if they consult K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or the\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam\u2014which constitute the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2014or the\nbona fide representative of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the man in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.  If economic development and material comforts could drive away one\u2019s\nlamentations for family, social, national or international inebrieties, then\nArjuna would not have said that even an unrivalled kingdom on earth or supremacy\nlike that of the demigods in the heavenly planets would not be able to drive\naway his lamentations. He sought, therefore, refuge in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, and\nthat is the right path for peace and harmony. Economic development or supremacy\nover the world can be finished at any moment by the cataclysms of material\nnature. Even elevation into a higher planetary situation, as men are now seeking\na place on the moon planet, can also be finished at one stroke. The\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 confirms this: k\u1e63\u012b\u1e47e pu\u1e47ye martyaloka\u1e41 vi\u015banti \u201cWhen the results\nof pious activities are finished, one falls down again from the peak of\nhappiness to the lowest status of life.\u201d Many politicians of the world have\nfallen down in that way. Such downfalls only constitute more causes for\nlamentation.  Therefore, if we want to curb lamentation for good, then we have to take shelter\nof K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, as Arjuna is seeking to do. So Arjuna asked K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to solve his problem\ndefinitely, and that is the way of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.",

And, because he\nwas lacking in that knowledge, he should not have posed himself as a very\nlearned man.

TRANSLATION  Never was there a time when I did not exist, nor you, nor all these kings; nor\nin the future shall any of us cease to be.  PURPORT  In the Vedas, in the Ka\u1e6dha Upani\u1e63ad as well as in the \u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad, it\nis said that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the maintainer of innumerable\nliving entities, in terms of their different situations according to individual\nwork and reaction of work. That Supreme Personality of Godhead is also, by His\nplenary portions, alive in the heart of every living entity. Only saintly\npersons who can see, within and without, the same Supreme Lord, can actually\nattain to perfect and eternal peace.  nityo nity\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 cetana\u015b cetan\u0101n\u0101m eko bah\u016bn\u0101\u1e41 yo vidadh\u0101ti k\u0101m\u0101n tam \u0101tmastha\u1e41 ye\n\u2019nupa\u015byanti dh\u012br\u0101s te\u1e63\u0101\u1e41 \u015b\u0101nti\u1e25 \u015b\u0101\u015bvat\u012b netare\u1e63\u0101m.  (Ka\u1e6dha 2.2.13)  The same Vedic truth given to Arjuna is given to all persons in the world who\npose themselves as very learned but factually have but a poor fund of knowledge.\nThe Lord says clearly that He Himself, Arjuna, and all the kings who are\nassembled on the battlefield, are eternally individual beings and that the Lord\nis eternally the maintainer of the individual living entities both in their\nconditioned as well as in their liberated situations. The Supreme Personality of\nGodhead is the supreme individual person, and Arjuna, the Lord\u2019s eternal\nassociate, and all the kings assembled there are individual, eternal persons. It\nis not that they did not exist as individuals in the past, and it is not that\nthey will not remain eternal persons. Their individuality existed in the past,\nand their individuality will continue in the future without interruption.\nTherefore, there is no cause for lamentation for anyone.  The M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b theory that after liberation the individual soul, separated by the\ncovering of m\u0101y\u0101 or illusion, will merge into the impersonal Brahman and lose\nits individual existence is not supported herein by Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the supreme\nauthority. Nor is the theory that we only think of individuality in the\nconditioned state supported herein. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a clearly says herein that in the future\nalso the individuality of the Lord and others, as it is confirmed in the\nUpani\u1e63ads, will continue eternally. This statement of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is authoritative\nbecause K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a cannot be subject to illusion. If individuality is not a fact,\nthen K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a would not have stressed it so much\u2014even for the future. The M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b\nmay argue that the individuality spoken of by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not spiritual, but\nmaterial. Even accepting the argument that the individuality is material, then\nhow can one distinguish K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s individuality? K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a affirms His individuality\nin the past and confirms His individuality in the future also. He has confirmed\nHis individuality in many ways, and impersonal Brahman has been declared to be\nsubordinate to Him. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has maintained spiritual individuality all along; if\nHe is accepted as an ordinary conditioned soul in individual consciousness, then\nHis Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 has no value as authoritative scripture. A common man with all\nthe four defects of human frailty is unable to teach that which is worth\nhearing. The G\u012bt\u0101 is above such literature. No mundane book compares with the\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. When one accepts K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as an ordinary man, the G\u012bt\u0101 loses all\nimportance. The M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b argues that the plurality mentioned in this verse is\nconventional and that it refers to the body. But previous to this verse such a\nbodily conception is already condemned. After condemning the bodily conception\nof the living entities, how was it possible for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to place a conventional\nproposition on the body again? Therefore, individuality is maintained on\nspiritual grounds and is thus confirmed by great \u0101c\u0101ryas like \u015ar\u012b R\u0101m\u0101nuja and\nothers. It is clearly mentioned in many places in the G\u012bt\u0101 that this spiritual\nindividuality is understood by those who are devotees of the Lord. Those who are\nenvious of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the Supreme Personality of Godhead have no bona fide access\nto the great literature. The nondevotee\u2019s approach to the teachings of the G\u012bta\nis something like bees licking on a bottle of honey. One cannot have a taste of\nhoney unless one opens the bottle. Similarly, the mysticism of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101\ncan be understood only by devotees, and no one else can taste it, as it is\nstated in the Fourth Chapter of the book. Nor can the G\u012bt\u0101 be touched by persons\nwho envy the very existence of the Lord. Therefore, the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b explanation of\nthe G\u012bt\u0101 is a most misleading presentation of the whole truth. Lord Caitanya has\nforbidden us to read commentations made by the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012bs and warns that one who\ntakes to such an understanding of the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophy loses all power to\nunderstand the real mystery of the G\u012bt\u0101. If individuality refers to the\nempirical universe, then there is no need of teaching by the Lord. The plurality\nof the individual soul and of the Lord is an eternal fact, and it is confirmed\nby the Vedas as above mentioned.",

TRANSLATION  As the embodied soul continually passes, in this body, from boyhood to youth to\nold age, the soul similarly passes into another body at death. The self-realized\nsoul is not bewildered by such a change.  PURPORT  Since every living entity is an individual soul, each is changing his body every\nmoment, manifesting sometimes as a child, sometimes as a youth, and sometimes as\nan old man. Yet the same spirit soul is there and does not undergo any change.\nThis individual soul finally changes the body at death and transmigrates to\nanother body; and since it is sure to have another body in the next birth\u2014either\nmaterial or spiritual\u2014there was no cause for lamentation by Arjuna on account of\ndeath, neither for Bh\u012b\u1e63ma nor for Dro\u1e47a, for whom he was so much concerned.\nRather, he should rejoice for their changing bodies from old to new ones,\nthereby rejuvenating their energy. Such changes of body account for varieties of\nenjoyment or suffering, according to one\u2019s work in life. So Bh\u012b\u1e63ma and Dro\u1e47a,\nbeing noble souls, were surely going to have either spiritual bodies in the next\nlife, or at least life in heavenly bodies for superior enjoyment of material\nexistence. So, in either case, there was no cause of lamentation.  Any man who has perfect knowledge of the constitution of the individual soul,\nthe Supersoul, and nature\u2014both material and spiritual\u2014is called a dh\u012bra or a\nmost sober man. Such a man is never deluded by the change of bodies. The\nM\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b theory of oneness of the spirit soul cannot be entertained on the\nground that spirit soul cannot be cut into pieces as a fragmental portion. Such\ncutting into different individual souls would make the Supreme cleavable or\nchangeable, against the principle of the Supreme Soul being unchangeable.  As confirmed in the G\u012bt\u0101, the fragmental portions of the Supreme exist eternally\n(san\u0101tana) and are called k\u1e63ara; that is, they have a tendency to fall down into\nmaterial nature. These fragmental portions are eternally so, and even after\nliberation, the individual soul remains the same\u2014fragmental. But once liberated,\nhe lives an eternal life in bliss and knowledge with the Personality of Godhead.\nThe theory of reflection can be applied to the Supersoul who is present in each\nand every individual body and is known as the Param\u0101tm\u0101, who is different from\nthe individual living entity. When the sky is reflected in water, the\nreflections represent both the sun and the moon and the stars also. The stars\ncan be compared to the living entities and the sun or the moon to the Supreme\nLord. The individual fragmental spirit soul is represented by Arjuna, and the\nSupreme Soul is the Personality of Godhead \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. They are not on the same\nlevel, as it will be apparent in the beginning of the Fourth Chapter. If Arjuna\nis on the same level with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not superior to Arjuna, then their\nrelationship of instructor and instructed becomes meaningless. If both of them\nare deluded by the illusory energy (m\u0101y\u0101), then there is no need of one being\nthe instructor and the other the instructed. Such instruction would be useless\nbecause, in the clutches of m\u0101y\u0101, no one can be an authoritative instructor.\nUnder the circumstances, it is admitted that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Lord,\nsuperior in position to the living entity, Arjuna, who is a forgotten soul\ndeluded by m\u0101y\u0101.",

They arise from sense perception, O scion of Bharata, and\none must learn to tolerate them without being disturbed.  PURPORT  In the proper discharge of duty, one has to learn to tolerate nonpermanent\nappearances and disappearances of happiness and distress. According to Vedic\ninjunction, one has to take his bath early in the morning even during the month\nof M\u0101gha (January-February). It is very cold at that time, but in spite of that\na man who abides by the religious principles does not hesitate to take his bath.\nSimilarly, a woman does not hesitate to cook in the kitchen in the months of May\nand June, the hottest part of the summer season. One has to execute his duty in\nspite of climatic inconveniences. Similarly, to fight is the religious principle\nof the k\u1e63atriyas, and although one has to fight with some friend or relative,\none should not deviate from his prescribed duty. One has to follow the\nprescribed rules and regulations of religious principles in order to rise up to\nthe platform of knowledge because by knowledge and devotion only can one\nliberate himself from the clutches of m\u0101y\u0101 (illusion).  The two different names of address given to Arjuna are also significant. To\naddress him as Kaunteya signifies his great blood relations from his mother\u2019s\nside; and to address him as Bh\u0101rata signifies his greatness from his father\u2019s\nside. From both sides he is supposed to have a great heritage. A great heritage\nbrings responsibility in the matter of proper discharge of duties; therefore, he\ncannot avoid fighting.",

PURPORT  Anyone who is steady in his determination for the advanced stage of spiritual\nrealization and can equally tolerate the onslaughts of distress and happiness is\ncertainly a person eligible for liberation. In the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama institution, the\nfourth stage of life, namely the renounced order (sanny\u0101sa) is a painstaking\nsituation. But one who is serious about making his life perfect surely adopts\nthe sanny\u0101sa order of life in spite of all difficulties. The difficulties\nusually arise from having to sever family relationships, to give up the\nconnection of wife and children. But if anyone is able to tolerate such\ndifficulties, surely his path to spiritual realization is complete. Similarly,\nin Arjuna\u2019s discharge of duties as a k\u1e63atriya, he is advised to persevere, even\nif it is difficult to fight with his family members or similarly beloved\npersons. Lord Caitanya took sanny\u0101sa at the age of twenty-four, and His\ndependants, young wife as well as old mother, had no one else to look after\nthem. Yet for a higher cause He took sanny\u0101sa and was steady in the discharge of\nhigher duties. That is the way of achieving liberation from material bondage.",

This seers have\nconcluded by studying the nature of both.  PURPORT  There is no endurance of the changing body. That the body is changing every\nmoment by the actions and reactions of the different cells is admitted by modern\nmedical science; and thus growth and old age are taking place in the body. But\nthe spirit soul exists permanently, remaining the same despite all changes of\nthe body and the mind. That is the difference between matter and spirit. By\nnature, the body is ever changing, and the soul is eternal. This conclusion is\nestablished by all classes of seers of the truth, both impersonalist and\npersonalist. In the Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Pur\u0101\u1e47a it is stated that Vi\u1e63\u1e47u and His abodes all have\nself-illuminated spiritual existence. \u201cJyot\u012b\u1e41\u1e63i vi\u1e63\u1e47ur bhavan\u0101ni vi\u1e63\u1e47u\u1e25.\u201d The\nwords existent and nonexistent refer only to spirit and matter. That is the\nversion of all seers of truth.  This is the beginning of the instruction by the Lord to the living entities who\nare bewildered by the influence of ignorance. Removal of ignorance involves the\nreestablishment of the eternal relationship between the worshiper and the\nworshipable and the consequent understanding of the difference between the part\nand parcel living entities and the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One can\nunderstand the nature of the Supreme by thorough study of oneself, the\ndifference between oneself and the Supreme being understood as the relationship\nbetween the part and the whole. In the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btras, as well as in the\n\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, the Supreme has been accepted as the origin of all\nemanations. Such emanations are experienced by superior and inferior natural\nsequences. The living entities belong to the superior nature, as it will be\nrevealed in the Seventh Chapter. Although there is no difference between the\nenergy and the energetic, the energetic is accepted as the Supreme, and energy\nor nature is accepted as the subordinate. The living entities, therefore, are\nalways subordinate to the Supreme Lord, as in the case of the master and the\nservant, or the teacher and the taught. Such clear knowledge is impossible to\nunderstand under the spell of ignorance, and to drive away such ignorance the\nLord teaches the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 for the enlightenment of all living entities for\nall time.",

TRANSLATION  Know that which pervades the entire body is indestructible. No one is able to\ndestroy the imperishable soul.  PURPORT  This verse more clearly explains the real nature of the soul, which is spread\nall over the body. Anyone can understand what is spread all over the body: it is\nconsciousness. Everyone is conscious of the pains and pleasures of the body in\npart or as a whole. This spreading of consciousness is limited within one\u2019s own\nbody. The pains and pleasures of one body are unknown to another. Therefore,\neach and every body is the embodiment of an individual soul, and the symptom of\nthe soul\u2019s presence is perceived as individual consciousness. This soul is\ndescribed as one ten-thousandth part of the upper portion of the hair point in\nsize. The \u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad confirms this:  b\u0101l\u0101gra-\u015bata-bh\u0101gasya \u015batadh\u0101 kalpitasya ca bh\u0101go j\u012bva\u1e25 sa vij\u00f1eya\u1e25 sa\nc\u0101nanty\u0101ya kalpate.  \u201cWhen the upper point of a hair is divided into one hundred parts and again\n each of such parts is further divided into one hundred parts, each such part is\n the measurement of the dimension of the spirit soul.\u201d (Svet. 5.9) Similarly, in\n the Bh\u0101gavatam the same version is stated:  ke\u015b\u0101gra-\u015bata-bh\u0101gasya \u015bat\u0101\u1e41\u015ba\u1e25 s\u0101d\u1e5b\u015b\u0101tmaka\u1e25 j\u012bva\u1e25 s\u016bk\u1e63ma-svarupo \u2019ya\u1e41\nsa\u1e45khy\u0101t\u012bto hi cit-ka\u1e47a\u1e25  \u201cThere are innumerable particles of spiritual atoms, which are measured as one\nten-thousandth of the upper portion of the hair.\u201d  Therefore, the individual particle of spirit soul is a spiritual atom smaller\nthan the material atoms, and such atoms are innumerable. This very small\nspiritual spark is the basic principle of the material body, and the influence\nof such a spiritual spark is spread all over the body as the influence of the\nactive principle of some medicine spreads throughout the body. This current of\nthe spirit soul is felt all over the body as consciousness, and that is the\nproof of the presence of the soul. Any layman can understand that the material\nbody minus consciousness is a dead body, and this consciousness cannot be\nrevived in the body by any means of material administration. Therefore,\nconsciousness is not due to any amount of material combination, but to the\nspirit soul. In the Mu\u1e47\u1e0daka Upani\u1e63ad the measurement of the atomic spirit soul\nis further explained:  e\u1e63o \u2019\u1e47ur\u0101tm\u0101 cetas\u0101 veditavyo yasmin pr\u0101\u1e47a\u1e25 pa\u00f1cadh\u0101 sa\u1e41vive\u015ba pr\u0101\u1e47ai\u015b citta\u1e41\nsarvam otam praj\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 yasmin vi\u015buddhe vibhavaty e\u1e63a \u0101tm\u0101.  \u201cThe soul is atomic in size and can be perceived by perfect intelligence. This\natomic soul is floating in the five kinds of air [pr\u0101\u1e47a, ap\u0101na, vy\u0101na, sam\u0101na\nand ud\u0101na], is situated within the heart, and spreads its influence all over the\nbody of the embodied living entities. When the soul is purified from the\ncontamination of the five kinds of material air, its spiritual influence is\nexhibited.\u201d (Mu\u1e47\u1e0d. 3.1.9)  The ha\u1e6dha-yoga system is meant for controlling the five kinds of air encircling\nthe pure soul by different kinds of sitting postures\u2014not for any material\nprofit, but for liberation of the minute soul from the entanglement of the\nmaterial atmosphere.  So the constitution of the atomic soul is admitted in all Vedic literatures, and\nit is also actually felt in the practical experience of any sane man. Only the\ninsane man can think of this atomic soul as all-pervading Vi\u1e63\u1e47u-tattva.  The influence of the atomic soul can be spread all over a particular body.\nAccording to the Mu\u1e47\u1e0daka Upani\u1e63ad, this atomic soul is situated in the heart of\nevery living entity, and because the measurement of the atomic soul is beyond\nthe power of appreciation of the material scientists, some of them assert\nfoolishly that there is no soul. The individual atomic soul is definitely there\nin the heart along with the Supersoul, and thus all the energies of bodily\nmovement are emanating from this part of the body. The corpuscles which carry\nthe oxygen from the lungs gather energy from the soul. When the soul passes away\nfrom this position, activity of the blood, generating fusion, ceases. Medical\nscience accepts the importance of the red corpuscles, but it cannot ascertain\nthat the source of the energy is the soul. Medical science, however, does admit\nthat the heart is the seat of all energies of the body.  Such atomic particles of the spirit whole are compared to the sunshine\nmolecules. In the sunshine there are innumerable radiant molecules. Similarly,\nthe fragmental parts of the Supreme Lord are atomic sparks of the rays of the\nSupreme Lord, called by the name prabh\u0101 or superior energy. Neither Vedic\nknowledge nor modern science denies the existence of the spirit soul in the\nbody, and the science of the soul is explicitly described in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101\nby the Personality of Godhead Himself.",

There is no chance\nof maintaining it indefinitely. But the spirit soul is so minute that it cannot\neven be seen by an enemy, to say nothing of being killed. As mentioned in the\nprevious verse, it is so small that no one can have any idea how to measure its\ndimension. So from both viewpoints there is no cause of lamentation because the\nliving entity can neither be killed as he is, nor can the material body, which\ncannot be saved for any length of time, be permanently protected. The minute\nparticle of the whole spirit acquires this material body according to his work,\nand therefore observance of religious principles should be utilized. In the\nVed\u0101nta-s\u016btras the living entity is qualified as light because he is part and\nparcel of the supreme light. As sunlight maintains the entire universe, so the\nlight of the soul maintains this material body. As soon as the spirit soul is\nout of this material body, the body begins to decompose; therefore it is the\nspirit soul which maintains this body. The body itself is unimportant.

Nor is the living entity killable because of his spiritual\nconstitution. What is killed, or is supposed to be killed, is the body only.\nThis, however, does not at all encourage killing of the body.

TRANSLATION  For the soul there is never birth nor death. Nor, having once been, does he ever\ncease to be. He is unborn, eternal, ever-existing, undying and primeval. He is\nnot slain when the body is slain.  PURPORT  Qualitatively, the small atomic fragmental part of the Supreme Spirit is one\nwith the Supreme. He undergoes no changes like the body. Sometimes the soul is\ncalled the steady, or k\u016b\u1e6dastha. The body is subject to six kinds of\ntransformations. It takes its birth in the womb of the mother\u2019s body, remains\nfor some time, grows, produces some effects, gradually dwindles, and at last\nvanishes into oblivion. The soul, however, does not go through such changes. The\nsoul is not born, but, because he takes on a material body, the body takes its\nbirth. The soul does not take birth there, and the soul does not die. Anything\nwhich has birth also has death. And because the soul has no birth, he therefore\nhas no past, present or future. He is eternal, ever-existing, and primeval\u2014that\nis, there is no trace in history of his coming into being. Under the impression\nof the body, we seek the history of birth, etc., of the soul. The soul does not\nat any time become old, as the body does. The so-called old man, therefore,\nfeels himself to be in the same spirit as in his childhood or youth. The changes\nof the body do not affect the soul. The soul does not deteriorate like a tree,\nnor anything material. The soul has no by-product either. The by-products of the\nbody, namely children, are also different individual souls; and, owing to the\nbody, they appear as children of a particular man. The body develops because of\nthe soul\u2019s presence, but the soul has neither offshoots nor change. Therefore,\nthe soul is free from the six changes of the body.  In the Ka\u1e6dha Upani\u1e63ad also we find a similar passage which reads:  na j\u0101yate mriyate v\u0101 vipa\u015bcin n\u0101ya\u1e41 kuta\u015bcin na vibh\u016bva ka\u015bcit ajo nitya\u1e25\n\u015b\u0101\u015bvato \u2019ya\u1e41 pur\u0101\u1e47o na hanyate hanyam\u0101ne \u015bar\u012bre.  (Ka\u1e6dha 1.2.18)  The meaning and purport of this verse is the same as in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, but\nhere in this verse there is one special word, vipa\u015bcit, which means learned or\nwith knowledge.  The soul is full of knowledge, or full always with consciousness. Therefore,\nconsciousness is the symptom of the soul. Even if one does not find the soul\nwithin the heart, where he is situated, one can still understand the presence of\nthe soul simply by the presence of consciousness. Sometimes we do not find the\nsun in the sky owing to clouds, or for some other reason, but the light of the\nsun is always there, and we are convinced that it is therefore daytime. As soon\nas there is a little light in the sky early in the morning, we can understand\nthat the sun is in the sky. Similarly, since there is some consciousness in all\nbodies\u2014whether man or animal\u2014we can understand the presence of the soul. This\nconsciousness of the soul is, however, different from the consciousness of the\nSupreme because the supreme consciousness is all-knowledge\u2014past, present and\nfuture. The consciousness of the individual soul is prone to be forgetful. When\nhe is forgetful of his real nature, he obtains education and enlightenment from\nthe superior lessons of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.

There are two kinds of souls\u2014namely the minute particle soul (a\u1e47u-\u0101tm\u0101) and the\nSupersoul (the vibhu-\u0101tm\u0101).

PURPORT  Everything has its proper utility, and a man who is situated in complete\nknowledge knows how and where to apply a thing for its proper utility.\nSimilarly, violence also has its utility, and how to apply violence rests with\nthe person in knowledge. Although the justice of the peace awards capital\npunishment to a person condemned for murder, the justice of the peace cannot be\nblamed because he orders violence to another person according to the codes of\njustice. In Manu-sa\u1e41hit\u0101, the lawbook for mankind, it is supported that a\nmurderer should be condemned to death so that in his next life he will not have\nto suffer for the great sin he has committed. Therefore, the king\u2019s punishment\nof hanging a murderer is actually beneficial. Similarly, when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a orders\nfighting, it must be concluded that violence is for supreme justice, and, as\nsuch, Arjuna should follow the instruction, knowing well that such violence,\ncommitted in the act of fighting for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is not violence at all because, at\nany rate, the man, or rather the soul, cannot be killed; so for the\nadministration of justice, so-called violence is permitted. A surgical operation\nis not meant to kill the patient, but to cure him. Therefore the fighting to be\nexecuted by Arjuna at the instruction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is with full knowledge, so there\nis no possibility of sinful reaction.",

TRANSLATION  As a person puts on new garments, giving up old ones, similarly, the soul\naccepts new material bodies, giving up the old and useless ones.  PURPORT  Change of body by the atomic individual soul is an accepted fact. Even some of\nthe modern scientists who do not believe in the existence of the soul, but at\nthe same time cannot explain the source of energy from the heart, have to accept\ncontinuous changes of body which appear from childhood to boyhood and from\nboyhood to youth and again from youth to old age. From old age, the change is\ntransferred to another body. This has already been explained in the previous\nverse.  Transference of the atomic individual soul to another body is made possible by\nthe grace of the Supersoul.The Supersoul fulfills the desire of the atomic soul\nas one friend fulfills the desire of another. The Vedas, like the Mu\u1e47\u1e0daka\nUpani\u1e63ad, as well as the \u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upanisad, compare the soul and the\nSupersoul to two friendly birds sitting on the same tree. One of the birds (the\nindividual atomic soul) is eating the fruit of the tree, and the other bird\n(K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a) is simply watching His friend. Of these two birds\u2014although they are the\nsame in quality\u2014one is captivated by the fruits of the material tree, while the\nother is simply witnessing the activities of His friend. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the witnessing\nbird, and Arjuna is the eating bird. Although they are friends, one is still the\nmaster and the other is the servant. Forgetfulness of this relationship by the\natomic soul is the cause of one\u2019s changing his position from one tree to another\nor from one body to another. The j\u012bva soul is struggling very hard on the tree\nof the material body, but as soon as he agrees to accept the other bird as the\nsupreme spiritual master\u2014as Arjuna agreed to do by voluntary surrender unto\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a for instruction\u2014the subordinate bird immediately becomes free from all\nlamentations. Both the Ka\u1e6dha Upani\u1e63ad and \u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad confirm this:  sam\u0101ne v\u1e5bk\u1e63e puru\u1e63o nimagno \u2019n\u012b\u015bay\u0101 \u015bocati muhyam\u0101na\u1e25 ju\u1e63\u1e6da\u1e41 yad\u0101 pa\u015byaty anyam\n\u012b\u015bam asya mahim\u0101nam iti v\u012bta-\u015boka\u1e25  \u201cAlthough the two birds are in the same tree, the eating bird is fully engrossed\nwith anxiety and moroseness as the enjoyer of the fruits of the tree. But if in\nsome way or other he turns his face to his friend who is the Lord and knows His\nglories\u2014at once the suffering bird becomes free from all anxieties.\u201d Arjuna has\nnow turned his face towards his eternal friend, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and is understanding the\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 from Him. And thus, hearing from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he can understand the\nsupreme glories of the Lord and be free from lamentation.  Arjuna is advised herewith by the Lord not to lament for the bodily change of\nhis old grandfather and his teacher. He should rather be happy to kill their\nbodies in the righteous fight so that they may be cleansed at once of all\nreactions from various bodily activities. One who lays down his life on the\nsacrificial altar, or in the proper battlefield, is at once cleansed of bodily\nreactions and promoted to a higher status of life. So there was no cause for\nArjuna\u2019s lamentation.",

TRANSLATION  The soul can never be cut into pieces by any weapon, nor can he be burned by\nfire, nor moistened by water, nor withered by the wind.  PURPORT  All kinds of weapons, swords, flames, rains, tornadoes, etc., are unable to kill\nthe spirit soul. It appears that there were many kinds of weapons made of earth,\nwater, air, ether, etc., in addition to the modern weapons of fire. Even the\nnuclear weapons of the modern age are classified as fire weapons, but formerly\nthere were other weapons made of all different types of material elements.\nFirearms were counteracted by water weapons, which are now unknown to modern\nscience. Nor do modern scientists have knowledge of tornado weapons.\nNonetheless, the soul can never be cut into pieces, nor annihilated by any\nnumber of weapons, regardless of scientific devices.  Nor was it ever possible to cut the individual souls from the original Soul. The\nM\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b, however, cannot describe how the individual soul evolved from\nignorance and consequently became covered by illusory energy. Because they are\natomic individual souls (san\u0101tana) eternally, they are prone to be covered by\nthe illusory energy, and thus they become separated from the association of the\nSupreme Lord, just as the sparks of the fire, although one in quality with the\nfire, are prone to be extinguished when out of the fire. In the Var\u0101ha Pur\u0101\u1e47a,\nthe living entities are described as separated parts and parcels of the Supreme.\nThey are eternally so, according to the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 also. So, even after being\nliberated from illusion, the living entity remains a separate identity, as is\nevident from the teachings of the Lord to Arjuna. Arjuna became liberated by the\nknowledge received from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but he never became one with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",

The theory of monism is very difficult to\napply in this case, because the individual soul is never expected to become one\nhomogeneously. After liberation from material contamination, the atomic soul may\nprefer to remain as a spiritual spark in the effulgent rays of the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead, but the intelligent souls enter into the spiritual\nplanets to associate with the Personality of Godhead.

They live on the land, in the\nwater, in the air, within the earth and even within fire. The belief that they\nare sterilized in fire is not acceptable, because it is clearly stated here that\nthe soul cannot be burned by fire.

PURPORT  As described previously, the magnitude of the soul is so small for our material\ncalculation that he cannot be seen even by the most powerful microscope;\ntherefore, he is invisible. As far as the soul\u2019s existence is concerned, no one\ncan establish his existence experimentally beyond the proof of \u015bruti or Vedic\nwisdom. We have to accept this truth, because there is no other source of\nunderstanding the existence of the soul, although it is a fact by perception.\nThere are many things we have to accept solely on grounds of superior authority.\nNo one can deny the existence of his father, based upon the authority of his\nmother. There is no other source of understanding the identity of the father\nexcept by the authority of the mother. Similarly, there is no other source of\nunderstanding the soul except by studying the Vedas. In other words, the soul is\ninconceivable by human experimental knowledge. The soul is consciousness and\nconscious\u2014that also is the statement of the Vedas, and we have to accept that.\nUnlike the bodily changes, there is no change in the soul. As eternally\nunchangeable, the soul remains atomic in comparison to the infinite Supreme\nSoul. The Supreme Soul is infinite, and the atomic soul is infinitesimal.\nTherefore, the infinitesimal soul, being unchangeable, can never become equal to\nthe infinite soul, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This concept is\nrepeated in the Vedas in different ways just to confirm the stability of the\nconception of the soul. Repetition of something is necessary in order that we\nunderstand the matter thoroughly without error.",

TRANSLATION  If, however, you think that the soul is perpetually born and always dies, still\nyou have no reason to lament, O mighty-armed.  PURPORT  There is always a class of philosophers, almost akin to the Buddhists, who do\nnot believe in the separate existence of the soul beyond the body. When Lord\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a spoke the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, it appears that such philosophers existed, and\nthey were known as the Lok\u0101yatikas and Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ikas. These philosophers\nmaintained that life symptoms, or soul, takes place at a certain mature\ncondition of material combination. The modern material scientist and materialist\nphilosophers also think similarly. According to them, the body is a combination\nof physical elements, and at a certain stage the life symptoms develop by\ninteraction of the physical and chemical elements. The science of anthropology\nis based on this philosophy. Currently, many pseudo-religions\u2014now becoming\nfashionable in America\u2014are also adhering to this philosophy, as well as to the\nnihilistic nondevotional Buddhist sects.  Even if Arjuna did not believe in the existence of the soul\u2014as in the Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika\nphilosophy\u2014there would still have been no cause for lamentation. No one laments\nthe loss of a certain bulk of chemicals and stops discharging his prescribed\nduty. On the other hand, in modern science and scientific warfare, so many tons\nof chemicals are wasted for achieving victory over the enemy. According to the\nVaibh\u0101\u1e63ika philosophy, the so-called soul or \u0101tm\u0101 vanishes along with the\ndeterioration of the body. So, in any case, whether Arjuna accepted the Vedic\nconclusion that there is an atomic soul, or whether he did not believe in the\nexistence of the soul, he had no reason to lament. According to this theory,\nsince there are so many living entities generating out of matter every moment,\nand so many of them are being vanquished every moment, there is no need to\ngrieve for such an incidence. However, since he was not risking rebirth of the\nsoul, Arjuna had no reason to be afraid of being affected with sinful reactions\ndue to his killing his grandfather and teacher. But at the same time, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nsarcastically addressed Arjuna as mah\u0101-b\u0101hu, mighty-armed, because He, at least,\ndid not accept the theory of the Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ikas, which leaves aside the Vedic\nwisdom. As a k\u1e63atriya, Arjuna belonged to the Vedic culture, and it behooved him\nto continue to follow its principles.",

From this subtle state of\nunmanifestation comes manifestation, just as from ether, air is generated; from\nair, fire is generated; from fire, water is generated; and from water, earth\nbecomes manifested. From the earth, many varieties of manifestations take place.\nTake, for example, a big skyscraper manifested from the earth. When it is\ndismantled, the manifestation becomes again unmanifested and remains as atoms in\nthe ultimate stage. The law of conservation of energy remains, but in course of\ntime things are manifested and unmanifested\u2014that is the difference. Then what\ncause is there for lamentation either in the stage of manifestation or\nunmanifestation? Somehow or other, even in the unmanifested stage, things are\nnot lost. Both at the beginning and at the end, all elements remain\nunmanifested, and only in the middle are they manifested, and this does not make\nany real material difference.  And if we accept the Vedic conclusion as stated in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (antavanta\nime deh\u0101\u1e25) that these material bodies are perishable in due course of time\n(nityasyokt\u0101\u1e25 \u015bar\u012bri\u1e47a\u1e25) but that soul is eternal, then we must remember always\nthat the body is like a dress; therefore why lament the changing of a dress? The\nmaterial body has no factual existence in relation to the eternal soul. It is\nsomething like a dream. In a dream we may think of flying in the sky, or sitting\non a chariot as a king, but when we wake up we can see that we are neither in\nthe sky nor seated on the chariot. The Vedic wisdom encourages self-realization\non the basis of the nonexistence of the material body. Therefore, in either\ncase, whether one believes in the existence of the soul, or one does not believe\nin the existence of the soul, there is no cause for lamentation for loss of the\nbody.",

TRANSLATION  Some look on the soul as amazing, some describe him as amazing, and some hear of\nhim as amazing, while others, even after hearing about him, cannot understand\nhim at all.  PURPORT  Since G\u012btopani\u1e63ad is largely based on the principles of the Upani\u1e63ads, it is not\nsurprising to also find this passage in the Ka\u1e6dha Upani\u1e63ad.  \u015brava\u1e47\u0101y\u0101pi bahubhir yo na labhya\u1e25 \u015b\u1e5b\u1e47vanto \u2019pi bahavo ya\u1e25 na vidyu\u1e25 \u0101\u015bcaryo\nvakt\u0101 ku\u015balo \u2019sya labdh\u0101 \u0101\u015bcaryo j\u00f1\u0101t\u0101 ku\u015bal\u0101nu\u015bi\u1e63\u1e6da\u1e25.  The fact that the atomic soul is within the body of a gigantic animal, in the\nbody of a gigantic banyan tree, and also in the microbic germs, millions and\nbillions of which occupy only an inch of space, is certainly very amazing. Men\nwith a poor fund of knowledge and men who are not austere cannot understand the\nwonders of the individual atomic spark of spirit, even though it is explained by\nthe greatest authority of knowledge, who imparted lessons even to Brahm\u0101, the\nfirst living being in the universe. Owing to a gross material conception of\nthings, most men in this age cannot imagine how such a small particle can become\nboth so great and so small. So men look at the soul proper as wonderful either\nby constitution or by description. Illusioned by the material energy, people are\nso engrossed in subject matter for sense gratification that they have very\nlittle time to understand the question of self-understanding, even though it is\na fact that without this self-understanding all activities result in ultimate\ndefeat in the struggle for existence. Perhaps one has no idea that one must\nthink of the soul, and also make a solution of the material miseries.  Some people who are inclined to hear about the soul may be attending lectures,\nin good association, but sometimes, owing to ignorance, they are misguided by\nacceptance of the Supersoul and the atomic soul as one without distinction of\nmagnitude. It is very difficult to find a man who perfectly understands the\nposition of the soul, the Supersoul, the atomic soul, their respective\nfunctions, relationships and all other major and minor details. And it is still\nmore difficult to find a man who has actually derived full benefit from\nknowledge of the soul, and who is able to describe the position of the soul in\ndifferent aspects. But if, somehow or other, one is able to understand the\nsubject matter of the soul, then one\u2019s life is successful. The easiest process\nfor understanding the subject matter of self, however, is to accept the\nstatements of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 spoken by the greatest authority, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a,\nwithout being deviated by other theories. But it also requires a great deal of\npenance and sacrifice, either in this life or in the previous ones, before one\nis able to accept K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can,\nhowever, be known as such by the causeless mercy of the pure devotee and by no\nother way.",

On the authority of \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one has to\nbelieve that there is a soul different from the material body, not that there is\nno such thing as soul, or that living symptoms develop at a certain stage of\nmaterial maturity resulting from the interaction of chemicals.

TRANSLATION  Considering your specific duty as a k\u1e63atriya, you should know that there is no\nbetter engagement for you than fighting on religious principles; and so there is\nno need for hesitation.  PURPORT  Out of the four orders of social administration, the second order, for the\nmatter of good administration, is called k\u1e63atriya. K\u1e63at means hurt. One who\ngives protection from harm is called k\u1e63atriya (trayate\u2014to give protection). The\nk\u1e63atriyas are trained for killing in the forest. A k\u1e63atriya would go into the\nforest and challenge a tiger face to face and fight with the tiger with his\nsword. When the tiger was killed, it would be offered the royal order of\ncremation. This system is being followed even up to the present day by the\nk\u1e63atriya kings of Jaipur state. The k\u1e63atriyas are specially trained for\nchallenging and killing because religious violence is sometimes a necessary\nfactor. Therefore, k\u1e63atriyas are never meant for accepting directly the order of\nsanny\u0101sa or renunciation. Nonviolence in politics may be a diplomacy, but it is\nnever a factor or principle. In the religious law books it is stated:  \u0101have\u1e63u mitho \u2019nyonya\u1e41 jigh\u0101\u1e41santo mah\u012bk\u1e63ita\u1e25 yuddham\u0101n\u0101\u1e25 para\u1e41 \u015bakty\u0101 svarga\u1e41\ny\u0101nty apar\u0101\u1e45mukh\u0101\u1e25 yaj\u00f1e\u1e63u pa\u015bavo brahman hanyante satata\u1e41 dvijai\u1e25 sa\u1e41sk\u1e5bt\u0101\u1e25\nkila mantrai\u015b ca te \u2019pi svargam av\u0101pnuvan.  \u201cIn the battlefield, a king or k\u1e63atriya, while fighting another king envious of\nhim, is eligible for achieving heavenly planets after death, as the br\u0101hma\u1e47as\nalso attain the heavenly planets by sacrificing animals in the sacrificial\nfire.\u201d Therefore, killing on the battle on the religious principle and the\nkilling of animals in the sacrificial fire are not at all considered to be acts\nof violence, because everyone is benefitted by the religious principles\ninvolved. The animal sacrificed gets a human life immediately without undergoing\nthe gradual evolutionary process from one form to another, and the k\u1e63atriyas\nkilled in the battlefield also attain the heavenly planets as do the br\u0101hma\u1e47as\nwho attain them by offering sacrifice.  There are two kinds of svadharmas, specific duties. As long as one is not\nliberated, one has to perform the duties of that particular body in accordance\nwith religious principles in order to achieve liberation. When one is liberated,\none\u2019s svadharma\u2014specific duty\u2014becomes spiritual and is not in the material\nbodily concept. In the bodily conception of life there are specific duties for\nthe br\u0101hma\u1e47as and k\u1e63atriyas respectively, and such duties are unavoidable.\nSvadharma is ordained by the Lord, and this will be clarified in the Fourth\nChapter. On the bodily plane svadharma is called var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma, or man\u2019s\nsteppingstone for spiritual understanding. Human civilization begins from the\nstage of var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma, or specific duties in terms of the specific modes of\nnature of the body obtained. Discharging one\u2019s specific duty in any field of\naction in accordance with var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma serves to elevate one to a higher\nstatus of life.",

It will cause perpetual\nhabitation in hell.\u201d Such statements by Arjuna were due to ignorance only. He\nwanted to become nonviolent in the discharge of his specific duty. For a\nk\u1e63atriya to be in the battlefield and to become nonviolent is the philosophy of\nfools. In the Par\u0101\u015bara-sm\u1e5bti or religious codes made by Par\u0101\u015bara, the great sage\nand father of Vy\u0101sadeva, it is stated:  k\u1e63atriyo hi praj\u0101 rak\u1e63an \u015bastra-p\u0101\u1e47i\u1e25 prada\u1e47\u1e0dayan nirjitya parasainy\u0101di k\u1e63iti\u1e41\ndharme\u1e47a p\u0101layet.  \u201cThe k\u1e63atriya\u2019s duty is to protect the citizens from all kinds of difficulties,\nand for that reason he has to apply violence in suitable cases for law and\norder. Therefore he has to conquer the soldiers of inimical kings, and thus,\nwith religious principles, he should rule over the world.\u201d  Considering all aspects, Arjuna had no reason to refrain from fighting. If he\nshould conquer his enemies, he would enjoy the kingdom; and if he should die in\nthe battle, he would be elevated to the heavenly planets whose doors were wide\nopen to him. Fighting would be for his benefit in either case.",

That everything should be performed for the sake of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is\ntranscendental consciousness; so there is no reaction to material activities.

TRANSLATION  Thus far I have declared to you the analytical knowledge of s\u0101\u1e45khya philosophy.\nNow listen to the knowledge of yoga whereby one works without fruitive result. O\nson of P\u1e5bth\u0101, when you act by such intelligence, you can free yourself from the\nbondage of works.  PURPORT  According to the Nirukti, or the Vedic dictionary, sa\u1e45khya means that which\ndescribes phenomena in detail, and sa\u1e45khya refers to that philosophy which\ndescribes the real nature of the soul. And yoga involves controlling the senses.\nArjuna\u2019s proposal not to fight was based on sense gratification. Forgetting his\nprime duty, he wanted to cease fighting because he thought that by not killing\nhis relatives and kinsmen he would be happier than by enjoying the kingdom by\nconquering his cousins and brothers, the sons of Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra. In both ways, the\nbasic principles were for sense gratification. Happiness derived from conquering\nthem and happiness derived by seeing kinsmen alive are both on the basis of\npersona1 sense gratification, for there is a sacrifice of wisdom and duty.\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, therefore, wanted to explain to Arjuna that by killing the body of his\ngrandfather he would not be killing the soul proper, and He explained that all\nindividual persons, including the Lord Himself, are eternal individuals; they\nwere individuals in the past, they are individuals in the present, and they will\ncontinue to remain individuals in the future, because all of us are individual\nsouls eternally, and we simply change our bodily dress in different manners.\nBut, actually, we keep our individuality even after liberation from the bondage\nof material dress. An analytical study of the soul and the body has been very\ngraphically explained by Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. And this descriptive knowledge of the soul\nand the body from different angles of vision has been described here as s\u0101\u1e45khya,\nin terms of the Nirukti dictionary. This s\u0101\u1e45khya has nothing to do with the\ns\u0101\u1e45khya philosophy of the atheist Kapila. Long before the imposter Kapila\u2019s\ns\u0101\u1e45khya, the s\u0101\u1e45khya philosophy was expounded in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam by the\ntrue Lord Kapila, the incarnation of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who explained it to His mother,\nDevah\u016bti. It is clearly explained by Him that the Puru\u1e63a, or the Supreme Lord,\nis active and that He creates by looking over the prak\u1e5bti. This is accepted in\nthe Vedas and in the G\u012bt\u0101. The description in the Vedas indicates that the Lord\nglanced over the prak\u1e5bti, or nature, and impregnated it with atomic individuals\nsouls. All these individuals are working in the material world for sense\ngratification, and under the spell of material energy they are thinking of being\nenjoyers. This mentality is dragged to the last point of liberation when the\nliving entity wants to become one with the Lord. This is the last snare of m\u0101y\u0101\nor sense gratificatory illusion, and it is only after many, many births of such\nsense gratificatory activities that a great soul surrenders unto V\u0101sudeva, Lord\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, thereby fulfilling the search after the ultimate truth.  Arjuna has already accepted K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as his spiritual master by surrendering\nhimself unto Him: \u015bi\u1e63yas te \u2019ha\u1e41 \u015b\u0101dhi m\u0101\u1e41 tv\u0101\u1e41 prapannam. Consequently, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nwill now tell him about the working process in buddhi-yoga, or karma-yoga, or in\nother words, the practice of devotional service only for the sense gratification\nof the Lord. This buddhi-yoga is clearly explained in Chapter Ten, verse ten, as\nbeing direct communion with the Lord, who is sitting as Param\u0101tm\u0101 in everyone\u2019s\nheart. But such communion does not take place without devotional service. One\nwho is therefore situated in devotional or transcendental loving service to the\nLord, or, in other words, in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, attains to this stage of\nbuddhi-yoga by the special grace of the Lord. The Lord says, therefore, that\nonly to those who are always engaged in devotional service out of transcendental\nlove does He award the pure knowledge of devotion in love. In that way the\ndevotee can reach Him easily in the ever-blissful kingdom of God.  Thus the buddhi-yoga mentioned in this verse is the devotional service of the\nLord, and the word s\u0101\u1e45khya mentioned herein has nothing to do with the atheistic\ns\u0101\u1e45khya-yoga enunciated by the impostor Kapila. One should not, therefore,\nmisunderstand that the s\u0101\u1e45khya-yoga mentioned herein has any connection with the\natheistic s\u0101\u1e45khya. Nor did that philosophy have any influence during that time;\nnor would Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a care to mention such godless philosophical speculations.\nReal s\u0101\u1e45khya philosophy is described by Lord Kapila in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,\nbut even that s\u0101\u1e45khya has nothing to do with the current topics. Here, s\u0101\u1e45khya\nmeans analytical description of the body and the soul. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a made an\nanalytical description of the soul just to bring Arjuna to the point of\nbuddhi-yoga, or bhakti-yoga. Therefore, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s s\u0101\u1e45khya and Lord Kapila\u2019s\ns\u0101\u1e45khya, as described in the Bh\u0101gavatam; are one and the same. They are all\nbhakti-yoga. He said, therefore, that only the less intelligent class of men\nmake a distinction between s\u0101\u1e45khya-yoga and bhakti-yoga.  Of course, atheistic s\u0101\u1e45khya-yoga has nothing to do with bhakti-yoga, yet the\nunintelligent claim that the atheistic s\u0101\u1e45khya-yoga is referred to in the\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.  One should therefore understand that buddhi-yoga means to work in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness, in the full bliss and knowledge of devotional service. One who\nworks for the satisfaction of the Lord only, however difficult such work may be,\nis working under the principles of buddhi-yoga and finds himself always in\ntranscendental bliss. By such transcendental engagement, one achieves all\ntranscendental qualities automatically, by the grace of the Lord, and thus his\nliberation is complete in itself, without his making extraneous endeavors to\nacquire knowledge. There is much difference between work in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness\nand work for fruitive results, especially in the matter of sense gratification\nfor achieving results in terms of family or material happiness. Buddhi-yoga is\ntherefore the transcendental quality of the work that we perform.",

TRANSLATION  In this endeavor there is no loss or diminution, and a little advancement on\nthis path can protect one from the most dangerous type of fear.  PURPORT  Activity in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, or acting for the benefit of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a without\nexpectation of sense gratification, is the highest transcendental quality of\nwork. Even a small beginning of such activity finds no impediment, nor can that\nsmall beginning be lost at any stage. Any work begun on the material plane has\nto be completed, otherwise the whole attempt becomes a failure. But any work\nbegun in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness has a permanent effect, even though not finished.\nThe performer of such work is therefore not at a loss even if his work in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness is incomplete. One percent done in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness bears\npermanent results, so that the next beginning is from the point of two percent;\nwhereas, in material activity, without a hundred percent success, there is no\nprofit. Aj\u0101mila performed his duty in some percentage of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness,\nbut the result he enjoyed at the end was a hundred percent, by the grace of the\nLord. There is a nice verse in this connection in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam:  tyaktv\u0101 sva-dharma\u1e41 cara\u1e47\u0101mbuja\u1e41 harer bhajan na pakko \u2019tha patet tato yadi\nyatra kva v\u0101bhadram abh\u016bd amu\u1e63ya ki\u1e41 ko v\u0101rtha \u0101pto \u2019bhajat\u0101\u1e41 sva-dharmata\u1e25  \u201cIf someone gives up self-gratificatory pursuits and works in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness and then falls down on account of not completing his work, what\nloss is there on his part? And, what can one gain if one performs his material\nactivities perfectly?\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 1.5.17) Or, as the Christians say, \u201cWhat profiteth\na man if he gain the whole world yet suffers the loss of his eternal soul?\u201d  Material activities and their results end with the body. But work in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness carries the person again to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, even after the\nloss of the body. At least one is sure to have a chance in the next life of\nbeing born again as a human being, either in the family of a great cultured\nbr\u0101hma\u1e47a or in a rich aristocratic family that will give one a further chance\nfor elevation. That is the unique quality of work done in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.",

TRANSLATION  Those who are on this path are resolute in purpose, and their aim is one. O\nbeloved child of the Kurus, the intelligence of those who are irresolute is\nmany-branched.  PURPORT  A strong faith in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness that one should be elevated to the highest\nperfection of life is called vyavas\u0101y\u0101tmik\u0101 intelligence. The\nCaitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta [Cc. Madhya 22.62] states:  \u2018\u015braddh\u0101\u2019-\u015babde vi\u015bv\u0101sa kahe sud\u1e5b\u1e0dha ni\u015bcaya k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47e bhakti kaile sarva-karma k\u1e5bta\nhaya  Faith means unflinching trust in something sublime. When one is engaged in the\nduties of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, he need not act in relationship to the material\nworld with obligations to family traditions, humanity, or nationality. Fruitive\nactivities are the engagements of one\u2019s reactions from past good or bad deeds.\nWhen one is awake in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, he need no longer endeavor for good\nresults in his activities. When one is situated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, all\nactivities are on the absolute plane, for they are no longer subject to\ndualities like good and bad. The highest perfection of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is\nrenunciation of the material conception of life. This state is automatically\nachieved by progressive K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. The resolute purpose of a person in\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is based on knowledge (\u201cV\u0101sudeva\u1e25 sarvam iti sa mah\u0101tm\u0101\nsudurlabha\u1e25\u201d) by which one comes to know perfectly that V\u0101sudeva, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is\nthe root of all manifested causes. As water on the root of a tree is\nautomatically distributed to the leaves and branches, in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness,\none can render the highest service to everyone\u2014namely self, family, society,\ncountry, humanity, etc. If K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is satisfied by one\u2019s actions, then everyone\nwill be satisfied.  Service in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is, however, best practiced under the able\nguidance of a spiritual master who is a bona fide representative of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who\nknows the nature of the student and who can guide him to act in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness. As such, to be well-versed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness one has to act\nfirmly and obey the representative of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and one should accept the\ninstruction of the bona fide spiritual master as one\u2019s mission in life. \u015ar\u012bla\nVi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kur instructs us, in his famous prayers for the\nspiritual master, as follows:  yasya pras\u0101d\u0101d bhagavat-pras\u0101do yasy\u0101pras\u0101d\u0101nna gati\u1e25 kuto \u2019pi dhy\u0101ya\u1e41 stuva\u1e41s\ntasya ya\u015bas tri-sandhya\u1e41 vande guro\u1e25 \u015br\u012b-cara\u1e47\u0101ravindam.  \u201cBy satisfaction of the spiritual master, the Supreme Personality of Godhead\nbecomes satisfied. And by not satisfying the spiritual master, there is no\nchance of being promoted to the plane of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. I should,\ntherefore, meditate and pray for his mercy three times a day, and offer my\nrespectful obeisances unto him, my spiritual master.\u201d  The whole process, however, depends on perfect knowledge of the soul beyond the\nconception of the body\u2014not theoretically but practically, when there is no\nlonger chance for sense gratification manifested in fruitive activities. One who\nis not firmly fixed in mind is diverted by various types of fruitive acts.",

TRANSLATION  Men of small knowledge are very much attached to the flowery words of the Vedas,\nwhich recommend various fruitive activities for elevation to heavenly planets,\nresultant good birth, power, and so forth. Being desirous of sense gratification\nand opulent life, they say that there is nothing more than this.  PURPORT  People in general are not very intelligent, and due to their ignorance they are\nmost attached to the fruitive activities recommended in the karma-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da portions\nof the Vedas. They do not want anything more than sense gratificatory proposals\nfor enjoying life in heaven, where wine and women are available and material\nopulence is very common. In the Vedas many sacrifices are recommended for\nelevation to the heavenly planets, especially the jyoti\u1e63\u1e6doma sacrifices. In\nfact, it is stated that anyone desiring elevation to heavenly planets must\nperform these sacrifices, and men with a poor fund of knowledge think that this\nis the whole purpose of Vedic wisdom. It is very difficult for such\ninexperienced persons to be situated in the determined action of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness. As fools are attached to the flowers of poisonous trees without\nknowing the results of such attractions, similarly unenlightened men are\nattracted by such heavenly opulence and the sense enjoyment thereof.  In the karma-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da section of the Vedas it is said that those who perform the\nfour monthly penances become eligible to drink the somarasa beverages to become\nimmortal and happy forever. Even on this earth some are very eager to have\nsomarasa to become strong and fit to enjoy sense gratifications. Such persons\nhave no faith in liberation from material bondage, and they are very much\nattached to the pompous ceremonies of Vedic sacrifices. They are generally\nsensual, and they do not want anything other than the heavenly pleasures of\nlife. It is understood that there are gardens called nandana-k\u0101nana in which\nthere is good opportunity for association with angelic, beautiful women and\nhaving a profuse supply of somarasa wine. Such bodily happiness is certainly\nsensual; therefore there are those who are purely attached to material,\ntemporary happiness, as lords of the material world.",

TRANSLATION  The Vedas mainly deal with the subject of the three modes of material nature.\nRise above these modes, O Arjuna. Be transcendental to all of them. Be free from\nall dualities and from all anxieties for gain and safety, and be established in\nthe Self.  PURPORT  All material activities involve actions and reactions in the three modes of\nmaterial nature. They are meant for fruitive results, which cause bondage in the\nmaterial world. The Vedas deal mostly with fruitive activities to gradually\nelevate the general public from the field of sense gratification to a position\non the transcendental plane. Arjuna, as a student and friend of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is\nadvised to raise himself to the transcendental position of Ved\u0101nta philosophy\nwhere, in the beginning, there is brahma-jij\u00f1\u0101s\u0101, or questions on the Supreme\nTranscendence. All the living entities who are in the material world are\nstruggling very hard for existence. For them the Lord, after creation of the\nmaterial world, gave the Vedic wisdom advising how to live and get rid of the\nmaterial entanglement. When the activities for sense gratification, namely the\nkarma-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da chapter, are finished, then the chance for spiritual realization is\noffered in the form of the Upani\u1e63ads, which are part of different Vedas, as the\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is a part of the fifth Veda, namely the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata. The Upani\u1e63ads\nmark the beginning of transcendental life.  As long as the material body exists, there are actions and reactions in the\nmaterial modes. One has to learn tolerance in the face of dualities such as\nhappiness and distress, or cold and warmth, and by tolerating such dualities\nbecome free from anxieties regarding gain and loss. This transcendental position\nis achieved in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness when one is fully dependant on the good\nwill of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.### 2.46  y\u0101v\u0101n artha udap\u0101ne  sarvata\u1e25 samplutodake  t\u0101v\u0101n sarve\u1e63u vede\u1e63u  br\u0101hma\u1e47asya vij\u0101nata\u1e25  y\u0101v\u0101n\u2014all that; artha\u1e25\u2014is meant; udap\u0101ne\u2014in a well of water; sarvata\u1e25\u2014in all\nrespects; sampluta-udake\u2014in a great reservoir of water; t\u0101v\u0101n\u2014similarly;\nsarve\u1e63u\u2014in all; vede\u1e63u\u2014Vedic literatures; br\u0101hma\u1e47asya\u2014of the man who knows the\nSupreme Brahman; vij\u0101nata\u1e25\u2014of one who is in complete knowledge.  TRANSLATION  All purposes that are served by the small pond can at once be served by the\ngreat reservoirs of water. Similarly, all the purposes of the Vedas can be\nserved to one who knows the purpose behind them.  PURPORT  The rituals and sacrifices mentioned in the karma-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da division of the Vedic\nliterature are to encourage gradual development of self-realization. And the\npurpose of self-realization is clearly stated in the Fifteenth Chapter of the\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (15.15): the purpose of studying the Vedas is to know Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a,\nthe primeval cause of everything. So, self-realization means understanding K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nand one\u2019s eternal relationship with Him. The relationship of the living entities\nwith K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is also mentioned in the Fifteenth Chapter of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. The\nliving entities are parts and parcels of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; therefore, revival of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness by the individual living entity is the highest perfectional stage\nof Vedic knowledge. This is confirmed in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (3.33.7) as\nfollows:  aho bata \u015bvapaco\u2019to gar\u012by\u0101n yaj-jihv\u0101gre vartate n\u0101ma tubhyam tepus tapas te\njuhuvu\u1e25 sasnur \u0101ry\u0101 brahm\u0101n\u016bcur n\u0101ma g\u1e5b\u1e47anti ye te.  \u201cO my Lord, a person who is chanting Your holy name, although born of a low\nfamily like that of a c\u0101\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101la [dog eater], is situated on the highest platform\nof self-realization. Such a person must have performed all kinds of penances and\nsacrifices according to Vedic rituals and studied the Vedic literatures many,\nmany times after taking his bath in all the holy places of pilgrimage. Such a\nperson is considered to be the best of the \u0100ryan family.\u201d So one must be\nintelligent enough to understand the purpose of the Vedas, without being\nattached to the rituals only, and must not desire to be elevated to the heavenly\nkingdoms for a better quality of sense gratification. It is not possible for the\ncommon man in this age to follow all the rules and regulations of the Vedic\nrituals and the injunctions of the Ved\u0101ntas and the Upani\u1e63ads. It requires much\ntime, energy, knowledge and resources to execute the purposes of the Vedas. This\nis hardly possible in this age. The best purpose of Vedic culture is served,\nhowever, by chanting the holy name of the Lord, as recommended by Lord Caitanya,\nthe deliverer of all fallen souls. When Lord Caitanya was asked by a great Vedic\nscholar, Prak\u0101\u015b\u0101nanda Sarasvat\u012b, why He, the Lord, was chanting the holy name of\nthe Lord like a sentimentalist instead of studying Ved\u0101nta philosophy, the Lord\nreplied that His spiritual master found Him to be a great fool, and thus he\nasked Him to chant the holy name of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He did so, and became ecstatic\nlike a madman. In this age of Kali, most of the population is foolish and not\nadequately educated to understand Ved\u0101nta philosophy; the best purpose of\nVed\u0101nta philosophy is served by inoffensively chanting the holy name of the\nLord. Ved\u0101nta is the last word in Vedic wisdom, and the author and knower of the\nVed\u0101nta philosophy is Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; and the highest Vedantist is the great soul\nwho takes pleasure in chanting the holy name of the Lord. That is the ultimate\npurpose of all Vedic mysticism.",

TRANSLATION  You have a right to perform your prescribed duty, but you are not entitled to\nthe fruits of action. Never consider yourself to be the cause of the results of\nyour activities, and never be attached to not doing your duty.  PURPORT  There are three considerations here: prescribed duties, capricious work, and\ninaction. Prescribed duties refer to activities performed while one is in the\nmodes of material nature. Capricious work means actions without the sanction of\nauthority, and inaction means not performing one\u2019s prescribed duties. The Lord\nadvised that Arjuna not be inactive, but that he perform his prescribed duty\nwithout being attached to the result. One who is attached to the result of his\nwork is also the cause of the action. Thus he is the enjoyer or sufferer of the\nresult of such actions.  As far as prescribed duties are concerned, they can be fitted into three\nsubdivisions, namely routine work, emergency work and desired activities.\nRoutine work, in terms of the scriptural injunctions, is done without desire for\nresults. As one has to do it, obligatory work is action in the mode of goodness.\nWork with results becomes the cause of bondage; therefore such work is not\nauspicious. Everyone has his proprietory right in regard to prescribed duties,\nbut should act without attachment to the result; such disinterested obligatory\nduties doubtlessly lead one to the path of liberation.  Arjuna was therefore advised by the Lord to fight as a matter of duty without\nattachment to the result. His nonparticipation in the battle is another side of\nattachment. Such attachment never leads one to the path of salvation. Any\nattachment, positive or negative, is cause for bondage. Inaction is sinful.\nTherefore, fighting as a matter of duty was the only auspicious path of\nsalvation for Arjuna.",

PURPORT  K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a tells Arjuna that he should act in yoga. And what is that yoga? Yoga means\nto concentrate the mind upon the Supreme by controlling the ever-disturbing\nsenses. And who is the Supreme? The Supreme is the Lord. And because He Himself\nis telling Arjuna to fight, Arjuna has nothing to do with the results of the\nfight. Gain or victory are K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s concern; Arjuna is simply advised to act\naccording to the dictation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The following of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s dictation is real\nyoga, and this is practiced in the process called K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. By K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness only can one give up the sense of proprietorship. One has to\nbecome the servant of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or the servant of the servant of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. That is the\nright way to discharge duty in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, which alone can help one to\nact in yoga.  Arjuna is a k\u1e63atriya, and as such he is participating in the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma\ninstitution. It is said in the Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Pura\u1e47a that in the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma, the\nwhole aim is to satisfy Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. No one should satisfy himself, as is the rule in\nthe material world, but one should satisfy K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. So, unless one satisfies\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one cannot correctly observe the principles of var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma.\nIndirectly, Arjuna was advised to act as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a told him.",

In this way they can attain that state beyond all\nmiseries.  PURPORT  The liberated living entities seek that place where there are no material\nmiseries. The Bh\u0101gavatam says:  sam\u0101\u015brit\u0101 ye padapallava-plava\u1e41 mahat-pada\u1e41 pu\u1e47ya-ya\u015bo mur\u0101re\u1e25 bh\u0101vambudhir\nvatsa-pada\u1e41 para\u1e41 pada\u1e41 para\u1e41 pada\u1e41 yad vipad\u0101\u1e41 na te\u1e63\u0101m  (Bh\u0101g. 10.14.58)  \u201cFor one who has accepted the boat of the lotus feet of the Lord, who is the\nshelter of the cosmic manifestation and is famous as Mukunda or the giver of\nmukti, the ocean of the material world is like the water contained in a calf\u2019s\nhoofprint. Param padam, or the place where there are no material miseries, or\nVaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha, is his goal, not the place where there is danger in every step of\nlife.\u201d  Owing to ignorance, one does not know that this material world is a miserable\nplace where there are dangers at every step. Out of ignorance only, less\nintelligent persons try to adjust to the situation by fruitive activities,\nthinking that resultant actions will make them happy. They do not know that no\nkind of material body anywhere within the universe can give life without\nmiseries. The miseries of life, namely birth, death, old age and diseases, are\npresent everywhere within the material world. But one who understands his real\nconstitutional position as the eternal servitor of the Lord, and thus knows the\nposition of the Personality of Godhead, engages himself in the transcendental\nloving service of the Lord. Consequently he becomes qualified to enter into the\nVaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets, where there is neither material, miserable life, nor the\ninfluence of time and death. To know one\u2019s constitutional position means to know\nalso the sublime position of the Lord. One who wrongly thinks that the living\nentity\u2019s position and the Lord\u2019s position are on the same level is to be\nunderstood to be in darkness and therefore unable to engage himself in the\ndevotional service of the Lord. He becomes a lord himself and thus paves the way\nfor the repetition of birth and death. But one who, understanding that his\nposition is to serve, transfers himself to the service of the Lord, at once\nbecomes eligible for Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhaloka. Service for the cause of the Lord is called\nkarma-yoga or buddhi-yoga, or in plain words, devotional service to the Lord.",

PURPORT  There are many good examples in the lives of the great devotees of the Lord of\nthose who became indifferent to the rituals of the Vedas simply by devotional\nservice to the Lord. When a person factually understands K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and his\nrelationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he naturally becomes completely indifferent to the\nrituals of fruitive activities, even though an experienced br\u0101hma\u1e47a. \u015ar\u012b\nM\u0101dhavendra Pur\u012b, a great devotee and \u0101c\u0101rya in the line of the devotees, says:  sandhy\u0101-vandana bhadram astu bhavato bho\u1e25 sn\u0101na tubhya\u1e41 namo bho dev\u0101\u1e25 pitara\u015b\nca tarpa\u1e47a-vidhau n\u0101ha\u1e41 k\u1e63ama\u1e25 k\u1e63amyat\u0101m yatra kv\u0101pi ni\u1e63adya y\u0101dava-kulottamasya\nka\u1e41sa-dvi\u1e63a\u1e25 sm\u0101ra\u1e41 sm\u0101ram agha\u1e41 har\u0101mi tad ala\u1e41 manye kim anyena me.  \u201cO Lord, in my prayers three times a day, all glory to You.

Now wherever I sit, I can remember the great\ndescendant of the Yadu dynasty [K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a], the enemy of Ka\u1e41sa, and thereby I can\nfree myself from all sinful bondage. I think this is sufficient for me.\u201d  The Vedic rites and rituals are imperative for neophytes: comprehending all\nkinds of prayer three times a day, taking a bath early in the morning, offering\nrespects to the forefathers, etc. But, when one is fully in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness\nand is engaged in His transcendental loving service, one becomes indifferent to\nall these regulative principles because he has already attained perfection. If\none can reach the platform of understanding by service to the Supreme Lord\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he has no longer to execute different types of penances and sacrifices as\nrecommended in revealed scriptures. And, similarly, if one has not understood\nthat the purpose of the Vedas is to reach K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and simply engages in the\nrituals, etc., then he is uselessly wasting time in such engagements. Persons in\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness transcend the limit of \u015babda-brahma, or the range of the\nVedas and Upani\u1e63ads.",

TRANSLATION  The Blessed Lord said: O P\u0101rtha, when a man gives up all varieties of sense\ndesire which arise from mental concoction, and when his mind finds satisfaction\nin the self alone, then he is said to be in pure transcendental consciousness.  PURPORT  The Bh\u0101gavatam affirms that any person who is fully in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, or\ndevotional service of the Lord, has all the good qualities of the great sages,\nwhereas a person who is not so transcendentally situated has no good\nqualifications, because he is sure to be taking refuge in his own mental\nconcoctions. Consequently, it is rightly said herein that one has to give up all\nkinds of sense desire manufactured by mental concoction. Artificially, such\nsense desires cannot be stopped. But if one is engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness,\nthen, automatically, sense desires subside without extraneous efforts.\nTherefore, one has to engage himself in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness without hesitation,\nfor this devotional service will instantly help one on to the platform of\ntranscendental consciousness. The highly developed soul always remains satisfied\nin himself by realizing himself as the eternal servitor of the Supreme Lord.\nSuch a transcendentally situated person has no sense desires resulting from\npetty materialism; rather, he remains always happy in his natural position of\neternally serving the Supreme Lord.",

TRANSLATION  One who is not disturbed in spite of the threefold miseries, who is not elated\nwhen there is happiness, and who is free from attachment, fear and anger, is\ncalled a sage of steady mind.  PURPORT  The word muni means one who can agitate his mind in various ways for mental\nspeculation without coming to a factual conclusion. It is said that every muni\nhas a different angle of vision, and unless a muni differs from other munis, he\ncannot be called a muni in the strict sense of the term. N\u0101sau munir yasya mata\u1e41\nna binnam. But a sthita-dh\u012b-muni as mentioned herein by the Lord, is different\nfrom an ordinary muni The sthita-dh\u012b-muni is always in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, for\nhe has exhausted all his business of creative speculation. He has surpassed the\nstage of mental speculations and has come to the conclusion that Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a,\nor V\u0101sudeva, is everything. He is called a muni fixed in mind. Such a fully\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person is not at all disturbed by the onslaughts of the\nthreefold miseries, for he accepts all miseries as the mercy of the Lord,\nthinking himself only worthy of more trouble due to his past misdeeds; and he\nsees that his miseries, by the grace of the Lord, are minimized to the lowest.\nSimilarly, when he is happy he gives credit to the Lord, thinking himself\nunworthy of the happiness; he realizes that it is due only to the Lord\u2019s grace\nthat he is in such a comfortable condition and able to render better service to\nthe Lord. And, for the service of the Lord, he is always daring and active and\nis not influenced by attachment or aversion. Attachment means accepting things\nfor one\u2019s own sense gratification, and detachment is the absence of such sensual\nattachment. But one fixed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness has neither attachment nor\ndetachment because his life is dedicated in the service of the Lord.\nConsequently he is not at all angry even when his attempts are unsuccessful.

PURPORT  The test of a yog\u012b, devotee, or self-realized soul is that he is able to control\nthe senses according to his plan. Most people, however, are servants of the\nsenses and are thus directed by the dictation of the senses. That is the answer\nto the question as to how the yog\u012b is situated. The senses are compared to\nvenomous serpents. They want to act very loosely and without restriction. The\nyog\u012b, or the devotee, must be very strong to control the serpents\u2014like a snake\ncharmer. He never allows them to act independantly. There are many injunctions\nin the revealed scriptures; some of them are do-not\u2019s, and some of them are\ndo\u2019s. Unless one is able to follow the do\u2019s and the do-not\u2019s, restricting\noneself from sense enjoyment, it is not possible to be firmly fixed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness.

The process of restriction from sense enjoyment by rules and\nregulations is something like restricting a diseased person from certain types\nof eatables. The patient, however, neither likes such restrictions, nor loses\nhis taste for eatables. Similarly, sense restriction by some spiritual process\nlike a\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45ga-yoga, in the matter of yama, niyama, \u0101sana, pr\u0101\u1e47\u0101y\u0101ma, praty\u0101h\u0101ra,\ndhara\u1e47\u0101, dhy\u0101na, etc., is recommended for less intelligent persons who have no\nbetter knowledge.

Therefore, restrictions are there for the less\nintelligent neophytes in the spiritual advancement of life, but such\nrestrictions are only good if one actually has a taste for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\nWhen one is actually K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, he automatically loses his taste for pale\nthings.",

TRANSLATION  The senses are so strong and impetuous, O Arjuna, that they forcibly carry away\nthe mind even of a man of discrimination who is endeavoring to control them.  PURPORT  There are many learned sages, philosophers and transcendentalists who try to\nconquer the senses, but in spite of their endeavors, even the greatest of them\nsometimes fall victim to material sense enjoyment due to the agitated mind. Even\nVi\u015bv\u0101mitra, a great sage and perfect yog\u012b, was misled by Menak\u0101 into sex\nenjoyment, although the yog\u012b was endeavoring for sense control with severe types\nof penance and yoga practice. And,of course, there are so many similar instances\nin the history of the world. Therefore, it is very difficult to control the mind\nand the senses without being fully K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious. Without engaging the mind in\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one cannot cease such material engagements. A practical example is given\nby \u015ar\u012b Y\u0101mun\u0101c\u0101rya, a great saint and devotee, who says: \u201cSince my mind has been\nengaged in the service of the lotus feet of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and I have been enjoying\nan ever new transcendental humor, whenever I think of sex life with a woman, my\nface at once turns from it, and I spit at the thought.\u201d  K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is such a transcendentally nice thing that automatically\nmaterial enjoyment becomes distasteful. It is as if a hungry man had satisfied\nhis hunger by a sufficient quantity of nutritious eatables. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Ambar\u012b\u1e63a\nalso conquered a great yog\u012b, Durv\u0101s\u0101 Muni, simply because his mind was engaged\nin K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.",

PURPORT  That the highest conception of yoga perfection is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is clearly\nexplained in this verse. And, unless one is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, it is not at all\npossible to control the senses. As cited above, the great sage Durv\u0101s\u0101 Muni\npicked a quarrel with Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Ambar\u012b\u1e63a, and Durv\u0101s\u0101 Muni unnecessarily became\nangry out of pride and therefore could not check his senses. On the other hand,\nthe King, although not as powerful a yog\u012b as the sage, but a devotee of the\nLord, silently tolerated all the sage\u2019s injustices and thereby emerged\nvictorious.

TRANSLATION  While contemplating the objects of the senses, a person develops attachment for\nthem, and from such attachment lust develops, and from lust anger arises.  PURPORT  One who is not K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious is subjected to material desires while\ncontemplating the objects of senses. The senses require real engagements, and if\nthey are not engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, they will\ncertainly seek engagement in the service of materialism. In the material world\neveryone, including Lord \u015aiva and Lord Brahm\u0101\u2014to say nothing of other demigods\nin the heavenly planets\u2014is subjected to the influence of sense objects, and the\nonly method to get out of this puzzle of material existence is to become K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconscious. Lord \u015aiva was deep in meditation, but when P\u0101rvat\u012b agitated him for\nsense pleasure, he agreed to the proposal, and as a result K\u0101rtikeya was born.\nWhen Harid\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kur was a young devotee of the Lord, he was similarly allured\nby the incarnation of M\u0101y\u0101 Dev\u012b, but Harid\u0101sa easily passed the test because of\nhis unalloyed devotion to Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. As illustrated in the above-mentioned\nverse of \u015ar\u012b Y\u0101mun\u0101c\u0101rya, a sincere devotee of the Lord shuns all material sense\nenjoyment due to his higher taste for spiritual enjoyment in the association of\nthe Lord. That is the secret of success. One who is not, therefore, in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness, however powerful he may be in controlling the senses by\nartificial repression, is sure ultimately to fail, for the slightest thought of\nsense pleasure will agitate him to gratify his desires.",

TRANSLATION  From anger, delusion arises, and from delusion bewilderment of memory. When\nmemory is bewildered, intelligence is lost, and when intelligence is lost, one\nfalls down again into the material pool.  PURPORT  By development of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness one can know that everything has its use\nin the service of the Lord. Those who are without knowledge of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness artificially try to avoid material objects, and as a result,\nalthough they desire liberation from material bondage, they do not attain to the\nperfect stage of renunciation. On the other hand, a person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness knows how to use everything in the service of the Lord; therefore\nhe does not become a victim of material consciousness. For example, for an\nimpersonalist, the Lord, or the Absolute, being impersonal, cannot eat. Whereas\nan impersonalist tries to avoid good eatables, a devotee knows that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the\nsupreme enjoyer and that He eats all that is offered to Him in devotion. So,\nafter offering good eatables to the Lord, the devotee takes the remnants, called\npras\u0101dam. Thus everything becomes spiritualized and there is no danger of a\ndownfall. The devotee takes pras\u0101dam in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, whereas the\nnondevotee rejects it as material. The impersonalist, therefore, cannot enjoy\nlife due to his artificial renunciation; and for this reason, a slight agitation\nof the mind pulls him down again into the pool of material existence. It is said\nthat such a soul, even though rising up to the point of liberation, falls down\nagain due to his not having support in devotional service.",

Although the person in\nfull K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness may apparently be on the sensual plane, because of his\nbeing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, he has no attachment to sensual activities. The K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconscious person is concerned only with the satisfaction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and nothing\nelse. Therefore he is transcendental to all attachment.

Therefore to act or not to act is within his control because he\nacts only under the direction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.

But the person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is happy in the\nservice of the Lord, and he has no desires to be fulfilled. In fact, he does not\neven desire liberation from the so-called material bondage. The devotees of\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a have no material desires, and therefore they are in perfect peace.",

TRANSLATION  A person who has given up all desires for sense gratification, who lives free\nfrom desires, who has given up all sense of proprietorship and is devoid of\nfalse ego\u2014he alone can attain real peace.  PURPORT  To become desireless means not to desire anything for sense gratification. In\nother words, desire for becoming K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious is actually desirelessness. To\nunderstand one\u2019s actual position as the eternal servitor of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, without\nfalsely claiming this material body to be oneself and without falsely claiming\nproprietorship over anything in the world, is the perfect stage of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness. One who is situated in this perfect stage knows that because\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the proprietor of everything, therefore everything must be used for the\nsatisfaction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Arjuna did not want to fight for his own sense\nsatisfaction, but when he became fully K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious he fought because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nwanted him to fight. For himself there was no desire to fight, but for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a the\nsame Arjuna fought to his best ability. Desire for the satisfaction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is\nreally desirelessness; it is not an artificial attempt to abolish desires. The\nliving entity cannot be desireless or senseless, but he does have to change the\nquality of the desires. A materially desireless person certainly knows that\neverything belongs to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (\u012b\u015b\u0101v\u0101syam ida\u1e41 sarvam), and therefore he does not\nfalsely claim proprietorship over anything. This transcendental knowledge is\nbased on self-realization\u2014namely, knowing perfectly well that every living\nentity is the eternal part and parcel of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in spiritual identity. and\ntherefore the eternal position of the living entity is never on the level of\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or greater than Him. This understanding of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is the\nbasic principle of real peace.",

TRANSLATION  That is the way of the spiritual and godly life, after attaining which a man is\nnot bewildered. Being so situated, even at the hour of death, one can enter into\nthe kingdom of God.  PURPORT  One can attain K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness or divine life at once, within a second\u2014or\none may not attain such a state of life even after millions of births. It is\nonly a matter of understanding and accepting the fact. Kha\u1e6dv\u0101\u1e45ga Mah\u0101r\u0101ja\nattained this state of life just a few minutes before his death, by surrendering\nunto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Nirv\u0101\u1e47a means ending the process of materialistic life. According to\nBuddhist philosophy, there is only void after the completion of this material\nlife, but Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 teaches differently. Actual life begins after the\ncompletion of this material life. For the gross materialist it is sufficient to\nknow that one has to end this materialistic way of life, but for persons who are\nspiritually advanced, there is another life after this materialistic life.\nBefore ending this life, if one fortunately becomes K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, he at once\nattains the stage of Brahma-nirv\u0101\u1e47a. There is no difference between the kingdom\nof God and the devotional service of the Lord. Since both of them are on the\nabsolute plane, to be engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord\nis to have attained the spiritual kingdom. In the material world there are\nactivities of sense gratification, whereas in the spiritual world there are\nactivities of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Attainment of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness even during\nthis life is immediate attainment of Brahman, and one who is situated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness has certainly already entered into the kingdom of God.  Brahman is just the opposite of matter. Therefore br\u0101hm\u012b sthiti\u1e25 means \u201cnot on\nthe platform of material activities.\u201d Devotional service of the Lord is accepted\nin the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 as the liberated stage. Therefore, br\u0101hm\u012b-sthiti\u1e25 is\nliberation from material bondage.  \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktivinode \u1e6ch\u0101kur has summarized this Second Chapter of the\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 as being the contents for the whole text.

And the path of\nrealization has been recommended: buddhi-yoga, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Sometimes\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is misunderstood to be inertia, and one with such a\nmisunderstanding often withdraws to a secluded place to become fully K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconscious by chanting the holy name of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. But without being trained in\nthe philosophy of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, it is not advisable to chant the holy\nname of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in a secluded place where one may acquire only cheap adoration\nfrom the innocent public. Arjuna also thought of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness or\nbuddhi-yoga, or intelligence in spiritual advancement of knowledge, as something\nlike retirement from active life and the practice of penance and austerity at a\nsecluded place. In other words, he wanted to skillfully avoid the fighting by\nusing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness as an excuse. But as a sincere student, he placed the\nmatter before his master and questioned K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as to his best course of action.\nIn answer, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a elaborately explained karma-yoga, or work in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness, in this Third Chapter.\n\n\n3.2\n\n\nvy\u0101mi\u015bre\u1e47eva v\u0101kyena\n\n\nbuddhi\u1e41 mohayas\u012bva me\n\n\ntad eka\u1e41 vada ni\u015bcitya\n\n\nyena \u015breyo \u2019ham \u0101pnuy\u0101m\n\n\nvy\u0101mi\u015bre\u1e47a\u2014by equivocal; iva\u2014as; v\u0101kyena\u2014words; buddhim\u2014intelligence;\nmohayasi\u2014bewildering; iva\u2014as; me\u2014my; tat\u2014therefore; ekam\u2014only one; vada\u2014please\ntell; ni\u015bcitya\u2014ascertaining; yena\u2014by which; \u015breya\u1e25\u2014real benefit; aham\u2014I;\n\u0101pnuy\u0101m\u2014may have it.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nMy intelligence is bewildered by Your equivocal instructions. Therefore, please\ntell me decisively what is most beneficial for me.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nIn the previous chapter, as a prelude to the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, many different paths\nwere explained, such as s\u0101\u1e45khya-yoga, buddhi-yoga, control of the senses by\nintelligence, work without fruitive desire, and the position of the neophyte.\nThis was all presented unsystematically. A more organized outline of the path\nwould be necessary for action and understanding. Arjuna, therefore, wanted to\nclear up these apparently confusing matters so that any common man could accept\nthem without misinterpretation. Although K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a had no intention of confusing\nArjuna by any jugglery of words, Arjuna could not follow the process of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness\u2014either by inertia or active service. In other words, by his\nquestions he is clearing the path of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness for all students who\nseriously want to understand the mystery of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.\n\n\n3.3\n\n\n\u015br\u012b-bhagav\u0101n uv\u0101ca\n\n\nloke \u2019smin dvi-vidh\u0101 ni\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101\n\n\npur\u0101 prokt\u0101 may\u0101nagha\n\n\nj\u00f1\u0101na-yogena s\u0101\u1e45khy\u0101n\u0101\u1e41\n\n\nkarma-yogena yogin\u0101m\n\n\n\u015br\u012b bhagav\u0101n uv\u0101ca\u2014the Supreme Personality of Godhead said; loke\u2014in the world;\nasmin\u2014this; dvi-vidh\u0101\u2014two kinds of; ni\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101\u2014faith; pur\u0101\u2014formerly; prokt\u0101\u2014was\nsaid; may\u0101\u2014by Me; anagha\u2014O sinless one; j\u00f1\u0101na-yogena\u2014by the linking process of\nknowledge; s\u0101\u1e45khy\u0101n\u0101m\u2014of the empiric philosophers; karma-yogena\u2014by the linking\nprocess of devotion; yogin\u0101m\u2014of the devotees.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThe Blessed Lord said: O sinless Arjuna, I have already explained that there are\ntwo classes of men who realize the Self. Some are inclined to understand Him by\nempirical, philosophical speculation, and others are inclined to know Him by\ndevotional work.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nIn the Second Chapter, verse 39, the Lord explained two kinds of\nprocedures\u2014namely s\u0101\u1e45khya-yoga and karma-yoga, or buddhi-yoga. In this verse,\nthe Lord explains the same more clearly. S\u0101\u1e45khya-yoga, or the analytical study\nof the nature of spirit and matter, is the subject matter for persons who are\ninclined to speculate and understand things by experimental knowledge and\nphilosophy. The other class of men work in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, as it is\nexplained in the 61st verse of the Second Chapter. The Lord has explained, also\nin the 39th verse, that by working by the principles of buddhi-yoga, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness, one can be relieved from the bonds of action; and, furthermore,\nthere is no flaw in the process. The same principle is more clearly explained in\nthe 61st verse\u2014that this buddhi-yoga is to depend entirely on the Supreme (or\nmore specifically, on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a), and in this way all the senses can be brought\nunder control very easily. Therefore, both the yogas are interdependant, as\nreligion and philosophy. Religion without philosophy is sentiment, or sometimes\nfanaticism, while philosophy without religion is mental speculation. The\nultimate goal is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, because the philosophers who are also sincerely\nsearching after the Absolute Truth come in the end to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. This\nis also stated in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. The whole process is to understand the real\nposition of the self in relation to the Superself. The indirect process is\nphilosophical speculation, by which, gradually, one may come to the point of\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness; and the other process is directly connecting with\neverything in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Of these two, the path of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness\nis better because it does not depend on purifying the senses by a philosophical\nprocess. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is itself the purifying process, and by the direct\nmethod of devotional service it is simultaneously easy and sublime.\n\n\n3.4\n\n\nna karma\u1e47\u0101m an\u0101rambh\u0101n\n\n\nnai\u1e63karmya\u1e41 puru\u1e63o \u2019\u015bnute\n\n\nna ca sannyasan\u0101d eva\n\n\nsiddhi\u1e41 samadhigacchati\n\n\nna\u2014without; karma\u1e47\u0101m\u2014of the prescribed duties; an\u0101rambh\u0101t\u2014non-performance;\nnai\u1e63karmyam\u2014freedom from reaction; puru\u1e63ah\u2014man; a\u015bnute\u2014achieve; na\u2014nor; ca\u2014also;\nsannyasan\u0101t\u2014by renunciation; eva\u2014simply; siddhim\u2014success;\nsamadhigacchati\u2014attain.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nNot by merely abstaining from work can one achieve freedom from reaction, nor by\nrenunciation alone can one attain perfection.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe renounced order of life can be accepted upon being purified by the discharge\nof the prescribed form of duties which are laid down just to purify the heart of\nmaterialistic men. Without purification, one cannot attain success by abruptly\nadopting the fourth order of life (sanny\u0101sa). According to the empirical\nphilosophers, simply by adopting sanny\u0101sa, or retiring from fruitive activities,\none at once becomes as good as N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. But Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a does not approve this\nprinciple. Without purification of heart, sanny\u0101sa is simply a disturbance to\nthe social order. On the other hand, if someone takes to the transcendental\nservice of the Lord, even without discharging his prescribed duties, whatever he\nmay be able to advance in the cause is accepted by the Lord (buddhi-yoga).\nSvalpam apy asya dharmasya tr\u0101yate mahato bhay\u0101t.

Without the presence of the spirit soul, the material body cannot\nmove. The body is only a dead vehicle to be worked by the spirit soul, which is\nalways active and cannot stop even for a moment. As such, the spirit soul has to\nbe engaged in the good work of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, otherwise it will be engaged\nin occupations dictated by illusory energy. In contact with material energy, the\nspirit soul acquires material modes, and to purify the soul from such affinities\nit is necessary to engage in the prescribed duties enjoined in the \u015b\u0101stras. But\nif the soul is engaged in his natural function of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, whatever\nhe is able to do is good for him. The \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam affirms this:\n\n\ntyaktv\u0101 sva-dharma\u1e41 cara\u1e47\u0101mbuja\u1e41 harer bhajann apakvo \u2019tha patet tato yadi yatra\nkva v\u0101bhadram abh\u016bd amu\u1e63ya ki\u1e41 ko v\u0101rtha \u0101pto \u2019bhajat\u0101\u1e41 sva-dharmata\u1e25.\n\n\n\u201cIf someone takes to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, even though he may not follow the\nprescribed duties in the \u015b\u0101stras nor execute the devotional service properly,\nand even though he may fall down from the standard, there is no loss or evil for\nhim. But if he carries out all the injunctions for purification in the \u015b\u0101stras,\nwhat does it avail him if he is not K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious?\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 1.5.17) So the\npurificatory process is necessary for reaching this point of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness. Therefore, sanny\u0101sa, or any purificatory process, is to help\nreach the ultimate goal of becoming K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, without which everything is\nconsidered a failure.\n\n\n3.6\n\n\nkarmendriy\u0101\u1e47i sa\u1e41yamya\n\n\nya \u0101ste manas\u0101 smaran\n\n\nindriy\u0101rth\u0101n vim\u016b\u1e0dh\u0101tm\u0101\n\n\nmithy\u0101c\u0101ra\u1e25 sa ucyate\n\n\nkarma-indriy\u0101\u1e47i\u2014the five working sense organs; sa\u1e41yamya\u2014controlling; ya\u1e25\u2014anyone\nwho; \u0101ste\u2014remains; manas\u0101\u2014by mind; smaran\u2014thinking; indriya-arth\u0101n\u2014sense\nobjects; vim\u016b\u1e0dha\u2014foolish; \u0101tm\u0101\u2014soul; mithy\u0101-\u0101c\u0101ra\u1e25\u2014pretender; sa\u1e25\u2014he; ucyate\u2014is\ncalled.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nOne who restrains the senses and organs of action, but whose mind dwells on\nsense objects, certainly deludes himself and is called a pretender.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThere are many pretenders who refuse to work in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness but make a\nshow of meditation, while actually dwelling within the mind upon sense\nenjoyment. Such pretenders may also speak on dry philosophy in order to bluff\nsophisticated followers, but according to this verse these are the greatest\ncheaters. For sense enjoyment one can act in any capacity of the social order,\nbut if one follows the rules and regulations of his particular status, he can\nmake gradual progress in purifying his existence. But he who makes a show of\nbeing a yog\u012b, while actually searching for the objects of sense gratification,\nmust be called the greatest cheater, even though he sometimes speaks of\nphilosophy. His knowledge has no value because the effects of such a sinful\nman\u2019s knowledge are taken away by the illusory energy of the Lord. Such a\npretender\u2019s mind is always impure, and therefore his show of yogic meditation\nhas no value whatsoever.\n\n\n3.7\n\n\nyas tv indriy\u0101\u1e47i manas\u0101\n\n\nniyamy\u0101rabhate \u2019rjuna\n\n\nkarmendriyai\u1e25 karma-yogam\n\n\nasakta\u1e25 sa vi\u015bi\u1e63yate\n\n\nya\u1e25\u2014one who; tu\u2014but; indriy\u0101\u1e47i\u2014senses; manas\u0101\u2014by the mind; niyamya\u2014regulating;\n\u0101rabhate\u2014begins; arjuna\u2014O Arjuna; karma-indriyai\u1e25\u2014by the active sense organs;\nkarma-yogam\u2014devotion; asakta\u1e25\u2014without attachment; sa\u1e25\u2014he; vi\u015bi\u1e63yate\u2014by far the\nbetter.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nOn the other hand, he who controls the senses by the mind and engages his active\norgans in works of devotion, without attachment, is by far superior.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nInstead of becoming a pseudo-transcendentalist for the sake of wanton living and\nsense enjoyment, it is far better to remain in one\u2019s own business and execute\nthe purpose of life, which is to get free from material bondage and enter into\nthe kingdom of God. The prime sv\u0101rtha-gati, or goal of self-interest, is to\nreach Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. The whole institution of var\u1e47a and \u0101\u015brama is designed to help us\nreach this goal of life. A householder can also reach this destination by\nregulated service in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. For self-realization, one can live a\ncontrolled life, as prescribed in the \u015b\u0101stras, and continue carrying out his\nbusiness without attachment, and in that way make progress. Such a sincere\nperson who follows this method is far better situated than the false pretender\nwho adopts show-bottle spiritualism to cheat the innocent public. A sincere\nsweeper in the street is far better than the charlatan meditator who meditates\nonly for the sake of making a living.\n\n\n3.8\n\n\nniyata\u1e41 kuru karma tva\u1e41\n\n\nkarma jy\u0101yo hy akarma\u1e47a\u1e25\n\n\n\u015bar\u012bra-y\u0101tr\u0101pi ca te\n\n\nna prasiddhyed akarma\u1e47a\u1e25\n\n\nniyatam\u2014prescribed; kuru\u2014do; karma\u2014duties; tvam\u2014you; karma\u2014work; jy\u0101ya\u1e25\u2014better;\nhi\u2014than; akarma\u1e47a\u1e25\u2014without work; \u015bar\u012bra\u2014bodily; y\u0101tr\u0101\u2014maintenance; api\u2014even;\nca\u2014also; te\u2014your; na\u2014never; prasiddhyet\u2014effected; akarma\u1e47a\u1e25\u2014without work.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nPerform your prescribed duty, for action is better than inaction.

Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\ndid not want Arjuna to become a pretender, but that he perform his prescribed\nduties as set forth for k\u1e63atriyas. Arjuna was a householder and a military\ngeneral, and therefore it was better for him to remain as such and perform his\nreligious duties as prescribed for the householder k\u1e63atriya. Such activities\ngradually cleanse the heart of a mundane man and free him from material\ncontamination. So-called renunciation for the purpose of maintenance is never\napproved by the Lord, nor by any religious scripture. After all, one has to\nmaintain one\u2019s body and soul together by some work. Work should not be given up\ncapriciously, without purification of materialistic propensities. Anyone who is\nin the material world is certainly possessed of the impure propensity for\nlording it over material nature, or, in other words, for sense gratification.\nSuch polluted propensities have to be cleared. Without doing so, through\nprescribed duties, one should never attempt to become a so-called\ntranscendentalist, renouncing work and living at the cost of others.\n\n\n3.9\n\n\nyaj\u00f1\u0101rth\u0101t karma\u1e47o \u2019nyatra\n\n\nloko \u2019ya\u1e41 karma-bandhana\u1e25\n\n\ntad-artha\u1e41 karma kaunteya\n\n\nmukta-sa\u1e45ga\u1e25 sam\u0101cara\n\n\nyaj\u00f1a-arth\u0101t\u2014only for the sake of Yaj\u00f1a, or Vi\u1e63\u1e47u; karma\u1e47a\u1e25\u2014work done;\nanyatra\u2014otherwise; loka\u1e25\u2014this world; ayam\u2014this; karma-bandhana\u1e25\u2014bondage by work;\ntat\u2014Him; artham\u2014for the sake of; karma\u2014work; kaunteya\u2014O son of Kunt\u012b;\nmukta-sa\u1e45ga\u1e25\u2014liberated from association; sam\u0101cara\u2014do it perfectly.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nWork done as a sacrifice for Vi\u1e63\u1e47u has to be performed, otherwise work binds one\nto this material world. Therefore, O son of Kunt\u012b, perform your prescribed\nduties for His satisfaction, and in that way you will always remain unattached\nand free from bondage.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nSince one has to work even for the simple maintenance of the body, the\nprescribed duties for a particular social position and quality are so made that\nthat purpose can be fulfilled. Yaj\u00f1a means Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, or sacrificial\nperformances. All sacrificial performances also are meant for the satisfaction\nof Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. The Vedas enjoin: yaj\u00f1o vai vi\u1e63\u1e47u\u1e25. In other words, the same\npurpose is served whether one performs prescribed yaj\u00f1as or directly serves Lord\nVi\u1e63\u1e47u. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is therefore performance of yaj\u00f1a as it is prescribed\nin this verse. The var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama institution also aims at this for satisfying Lord\nVi\u1e63\u1e47u. \u201cVar\u1e47\u0101\u015bram\u0101c\u0101ra-vat\u0101 puru\u1e63e\u1e47a para\u1e25 pum\u0101n/vi\u1e63\u1e47ur \u0101r\u0101dhyate\u2026\u201d (Vi\u1e63\u1e47u\nPur\u0101\u1e47a 3.8.8) Therefore one has to work for the satisfaction of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Any other\nwork done in this material world wilI be a cause of bondage, for both good and\nevil work have their reactions, and any reaction binds the performer. Therefore,\none has to work in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness to satisfy K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (or Vi\u1e63\u1e47u); and while\nperforming such activities one is in a liberated stage. This is the great art of\ndoing work, and in the beginning this process requires very expert guidance. One\nshould therefore act very diligently, under the expert guidance of a devotee of\nLord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or under the direct instruction of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself (under whom\nArjuna had the opportunity to work). Nothing should be performed for sense\ngratification, but everything should be done for the satisfaction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This\npractice will not only save one from the reaction of work, but will also\ngradually elevate one to transcendental loving service of the Lord, which alone\ncan raise one to the kingdom of God.\n\n\n3.10\n\n\nsaha-yaj\u00f1\u0101\u1e25 praj\u0101\u1e25 s\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dv\u0101\n\n\npurov\u0101ca praj\u0101pati\u1e25\n\n\nanena prasavi\u1e63yadhvam\n\n\ne\u1e63a vo \u2019stv i\u1e63\u1e6da-k\u0101ma-dhuk\n\n\nsaha\u2014along with; yaj\u00f1\u0101\u1e25\u2014sacrifices; praj\u0101\u1e25\u2014generations; s\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dv\u0101\u2014by creating;\npur\u0101\u2014anciently; uv\u0101ca\u2014said; praj\u0101-pati\u1e25\u2014the Lord of creatures; anena\u2014by this;\nprasavi\u1e63yadhvam\u2014be more and more prosperous; e\u1e63a\u1e25\u2014certainly; va\u1e25\u2014your; astu\u2014let\nit be; i\u1e63\u1e6da\u2014all desirable; k\u0101ma-dhuk\u2014bestower.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nIn the beginning of creation, the Lord of all creatures sent forth generations\nof men and demigods, along with sacrifices for Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, and blessed them by\nsaying, \u201cBe thou happy by this yaj\u00f1a [sacrifice] because its performance will\nbestow upon you all desirable things.\u201d\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe material creation by the Lord of creatures (Vi\u1e63\u1e47u) is a chance offered to\nthe conditioned souls to come back home\u2014back to Godhead. All living entities\nwithin the material creation are conditioned by material nature because of their\nforgetfulness of their relationship to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead. The Vedic principles are to help us understand this eternal relation as\nit is stated in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101: vedai\u015b ca sarvair aham eva vedya\u1e25. The Lord\nsays that the purpose of the Vedas is to understand Him. In the Vedic hymns it\nis said: pati\u1e41 vi\u015bvasy\u0101tme\u015bvaram. Therefore, the Lord of the living entities is\nthe Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. In the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam also \u015ar\u012bla\n\u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b describes the Lord as pati in so many ways:\n\n\n\u015briya\u1e25-patir yaj\u00f1a-pati\u1e25 praj\u0101-patir dhiy\u0101\u1e41 patir loka-patir dhar\u0101-pati\u1e25 patir\ngati\u015b c\u0101ndhaka-v\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47i-s\u0101tvat\u0101\u1e41 pras\u012bdat\u0101\u1e41 me bhagav\u0101n sat\u0101\u1e41 pati\u1e25\n\n\n(Bh\u0101g. 2.4.20)\n\n\nThe praj\u0101-pati is Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, and He is the Lord of all living creatures, all\nworlds, and all beauties, and the protector of everyone. The Lord created this\nmaterial world for the conditioned souls to learn how to perform yaj\u00f1as\n(sacrifice) for the satisfaction of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, so that while in the material world\nthey can live very comfortably without anxiety. Then after finishing the present\nmaterial body, they can enter into the kingdom of God. That is the whole program\nfor the conditioned soul. By performance of yaj\u00f1a, the conditioned souls\ngradually become K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious and become godly in all respects. In this age\nof Kali, the sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-yaj\u00f1a (the chanting of the names of God) is recommended\nby the Vedic scriptures, and this transcendental system was introduced by Lord\nCaitanya for the deliverance of all men in this age. Sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-yaj\u00f1a and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness go well together. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in His devotional form (as Lord\nCaitanya) is mentioned in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam as follows, with special\nreference to the sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-yaj\u00f1a:\n\n\nk\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-var\u1e47a\u1e41 tvi\u1e63\u0101k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47\u0101\u1e41 s\u0101\u1e45gop\u0101\u1e45g\u0101stra-p\u0101r\u1e63adam yaj\u00f1ai\u1e25 sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-pr\u0101yair\nyajanti hi su-medhasa\u1e25\n\n\n\u201cIn this age of Kali, people who are endowed with sufficient intelligence will\nworship the Lord, who is accompanied by His associates, by performance of\nsa\u1e45k\u012brtana-yaj\u00f1a.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 11.5.29) Other yaj\u00f1as prescribed in the Vedic\nliteratures are not easy to perform in this age of Kali, but the\nsa\u1e45k\u012brtana-yaj\u00f1a is easy and sublime for all purposes.\n\n\n3.11\n\n\ndev\u0101n bh\u0101vayat\u0101nena\n\n\nte dev\u0101 bh\u0101vayantu va\u1e25\n\n\nparaspara\u1e41 bh\u0101vayanta\u1e25\n\n\n\u015breya\u1e25 param av\u0101psyatha\n\n\ndev\u0101n\u2014demigods; bh\u0101vayata\u2014having been pleased; anena\u2014by this sacrifice;\nte\u2014those; dev\u0101\u1e25\u2014the demigods; bh\u0101vayantu\u2014will please; va\u1e25\u2014you;\nparasparam\u2014mutual; bh\u0101vayanta\u1e25\u2014pleasing one another; sreya\u1e25\u2014benediction;\nparam\u2014the supreme; av\u0101psyatha\u2014do you achieve.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThe demigods, being pleased by sacrifices, will also please you; thus nourishing\none another, there will reign general prosperity for all.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe demigods are empowered administrators of material affairs. The supply of\nair, light, water and all other benedictions for maintaining the body and soul\nof every living entity are entrusted to the demigods, who are innumerable\nassistants in different parts of the body of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\nTheir pleasures and displeasures are dependant on the performance of yaj\u00f1as by\nthe human being. Some of the yaj\u00f1as are meant to satisfy particular demigods;\nbut even in so doing, Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is worshiped in all yaj\u00f1as as the chief\nbeneficiary. It is stated also in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself is the\nbeneficiary of all kinds of yaj\u00f1as: bhokt\u0101ra\u1e41 yaj\u00f1a-tapas\u0101m. Therefore, ultimate\nsatisfaction of the yaj\u00f1apati is the chief purpose of all yaj\u00f1as. When these\nyaj\u00f1as are perfectly performed, naturally the demigods in charge of the\ndifferent departments of supply are pleased, and there is no scarcity in the\nsupply of natural products.\n\n\nPerformance of yaj\u00f1as has many side benefits, ultimately leading to liberation\nfrom the material bondage. By performance of yaj\u00f1as, all activities become\npurified, as it is stated in the Vedas:\n\n\n\u0101h\u0101ra-\u015buddhau sattva-\u015buddhi\u1e25 sattva-\u015buddhau dhruv\u0101 sm\u1e5bti\u1e25 sm\u1e5bti-lambhe\nsarva-granth\u012bn\u0101\u1e41 vipra-mok\u1e63a\u1e25\n\n\nAs it will be explained in the following verse, by performance of yaj\u00f1a, one\u2019s\neatables become sanctified, and by eating sanctified foodstuffs, one\u2019s very\nexistence becomes purified; by the purification of existence, finer tissues in\nthe memory become sanctified, and when memory is sanctified, one can think of\nthe path of liberation, and all these combined together lead to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness, the great necessity of present-day society.\n\n\n3.12\n\n\ni\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101n bhog\u0101n hi vo dev\u0101\n\n\nd\u0101syante yaj\u00f1a-bh\u0101vit\u0101\u1e25\n\n\ntair datt\u0101n aprad\u0101yaibhyo\n\n\nyo bhu\u1e45kte stena eva sa\u1e25\n\n\ni\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101n\u2014desired; bhog\u0101n\u2014necessities of life; hi\u2014certainly; va\u1e25\u2014unto you; dev\u0101\u1e25\u2014the\ndemigods; d\u0101syante\u2014award; yaj\u00f1a-bh\u0101vit\u0101\u1e25\u2014being satisfied by the performance of\nsacrifices; tai\u1e25\u2014by them; datt\u0101n\u2014things given; aprad\u0101ya\u2014without offering;\nebhya\u1e25\u2014to the demigods; ya\u1e25\u2014he who; bhu\u1e45kte\u2014enjoys; stena\u1e25\u2014thief; eva\u2014certainly;\nsa\u1e25\u2014is he.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nIn charge of the various necessities of life, the demigods, being satisfied by\nthe performance of yaj\u00f1a [sacrifice], supply all necessities to man. But he who\nenjoys these gifts, without offering them to the demigods in return, is\ncertainly a thief.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe demigods are authorized supplying agents on behalf of the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Therefore, they must be satisfied by the\nperformance of prescribed yaj\u00f1as. In the Vedas, there are different kinds of\nyaj\u00f1as prescribed for different kinds of demigods, but all are ultimately\noffered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. For one who cannot understand\nwhat the Personality of Godhead is, sacrifice to the demigods is recommended.\nAccording to the different material qualities of the persons concerned,\ndifferent types of yaj\u00f1as are recommended in the Vedas. Worship of different\ndemigods is also on the same basis\u2014namely, according to different qualities. For\nexample, the meat-eaters are recommended to worship the goddess K\u0101l\u012b, the\nghastly form of material nature, and before the goddess the sacrifice of animals\nis recommended. But for those who are in the mode of goodness, the\ntranscendental worship of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is recommended. But ultimately, all yaj\u00f1as are\nmeant for gradual promotion to the transcendental position. For ordinary men, at\nleast five yaj\u00f1as, known as pa\u00f1ca-mah\u0101yaj\u00f1a, are necessary.\n\n\nOne should know, however, that all the necessities of life that the human\nsociety requires are supplied by the demigod agents of the Lord. No one can\nmanufacture anything. Take, for example, all the eatables of human society.\nThese eatables include grains, fruits, vegetables, milk, sugar, etc., for the\npersons in the mode of goodness, and also eatables for the nonvegetarians, like\nmeats, etc., none of which can be manufactured by men. Then again, take for\nexample heat, light, water, air, etc., which are also necessities of life\u2014none\nof them can be manufactured by the human society. Without the Supreme Lord,\nthere can be no profuse sunlight, moonlight, rainfall, breeze, etc., without\nwhich no one can live. Obviously, our life is dependant on supplies from the\nLord. Even for our manufacturing enterprises, we require so many raw materials\nlike metal, sulphur, mercury, manganese, and so many essentials\u2014all of which are\nsupplied by the agents of the Lord, with the purpose that we should make proper\nuse of them to keep ourselves fit and healthy for the purpose of\nself-realization, leading to the ultimate goal of life, namely, liberation from\nthe material struggle for existence. This aim of life is attained by performance\nof yaj\u00f1as. If we forget the purpose of human life and simply take supplies from\nthe agents of the Lord for sense gratification and become more and more\nentangled in material existence, which is not the purpose of creation, certainly\nwe become thieves, and therefore we are punished by the laws of material nature.\nA society of thieves can never be happy because they have no aim in life. The\ngross materialist thieves have no ultimate goal of life. They are simply\ndirected to sense gratification; nor do they have knowledge of how to perform\nyaj\u00f1as. Lord Caitanya, however, inaugurated the easiest performance of yaj\u00f1a,\nnamely the sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-yaj\u00f1a, which can be performed by anyone in the world who\naccepts the principles of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\n\n\n3.13\n\n\nyaj\u00f1a-\u015bi\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u015bina\u1e25 santo\n\n\nmucyante sarva-kilbi\u1e63ai\u1e25\n\n\nbhu\u00f1jate te tv agha\u1e41 p\u0101p\u0101\n\n\nye pacanty \u0101tma-k\u0101ra\u1e47\u0101t\n\n\nyaj\u00f1a-\u015bi\u1e63\u1e6da\u2014food taken after performance of yaj\u00f1a; a\u015bina\u1e25\u2014eaters; santa\u1e25\u2014the\ndevotees; mucyante\u2014get relief from; sarva\u2014all kinds of; kilbi\u1e63ai\u1e25\u2014sins;\nbhu\u00f1jate\u2014enjoy; te\u2014they; tu\u2014but; agham\u2014grievous sins; p\u0101p\u0101\u1e25\u2014sinners; ye\u2014those;\npacanti\u2014prepare food; \u0101tma-k\u0101ra\u1e47\u0101t\u2014for sense enjoyment.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThe devotees of the Lord are released from all kinds of sins because they eat\nfood which is offered first for sacrifice. Others, who prepare food for personal\nsense enjoyment, verily eat only sin.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe devotees of the Supreme Lord, or the persons who are in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness,\nare called santas, and they are always in love with the Lord as it is described\nin the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101: prem\u0101\u00f1jana- cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena santa\u1e25 sadaiva\nh\u1e5bdaye\u1e63u vilokayanti. The santas, being always in a compact of love with the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda (the giver of all pleasures), or Mukunda\n(the giver of liberation), or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (the all-attractive person), cannot accept\nanything without first offering it to the Supreme Person. Therefore, such\ndevotees always perform yaj\u00f1as in different modes of devotional service, such as\n\u015brava\u1e47am, k\u012brtanam, smara\u1e47am, arcanam, etc., and these performances of yaj\u00f1as\nkeep them always aloof from all kinds of contamination of sinful association in\nthe material world. Others, who prepare food for self or sense gratification,\nare not only thieves, but are also the eaters of all kinds of sins. How can a\nperson be happy if he is both a thief and sinful? It is not possible. Therefore,\nin order for people to become happy in all respects, they must be taught to\nperform the easy process of sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-yaj\u00f1a, in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\nOtherwise, there can be no peace or happiness in the world.\n\n\n3.14\n\n\nann\u0101d bhavanti bh\u016bt\u0101ni\n\n\nparjany\u0101d anna-sambhava\u1e25\n\n\nyaj\u00f1\u0101d bhavati parjanyo\n\n\nyaj\u00f1a\u1e25 karma-samudbhava\u1e25\n\n\nann\u0101t\u2014from grains; bhavanti\u2014grow; bh\u016bt\u0101ni\u2014the material bodies; parjany\u0101t\u2014from\nrains; anna\u2014food grains; sambhava\u1e25\u2014are made possible; yaj\u00f1\u0101t\u2014from the\nperformance of sacrifice; bhavati\u2014becomes possible; parjanya\u1e25\u2014rains;\nyaj\u00f1a\u1e25\u2014performance of yaj\u00f1a; karma\u2014prescribed duties; samudbhava\u1e25\u2014born of.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nAll living bodies subsist on food grains, which are produced from rain.

The Supreme Lord, who is known as the\nyaj\u00f1a-puru\u1e63a\u1e25, or the personal beneficiary of all sacrifices, is the master of\nall demigods who serve Him as the different limbs of the body serve the whole.\nDemigods like Indra, Candra, Varu\u1e47a, etc., are appointed officers who manage\nmaterial affairs, and the Vedas direct sacrifices to satisfy these demigods so\nthat they may be pleased to supply air, light and water sufficiently to produce\nfood grains. When Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is worshiped, the demigods, who are different limbs\nof the Lord, are also automatically worshiped; therefore there is no separate\nneed to worship the demigods. For this reason, the devotees of the Lord, who are\nin K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, offer food to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and then eat\u2014a process which\nnourishes the body spiritually. By such action not only are past sinful\nreactions in the body vanquished, but the body becomes immunized to all\ncontamination of material nature. When there is an epidemic disease, an\nantiseptic vaccine protects a person from the attack of such an epidemic.\nSimilarly, food offered to Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u and then taken by us makes us sufficiently\nresistant to material affection, and one who is accustomed to this practice is\ncalled a devotee of the Lord. Therefore, a person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, who\neats only food offered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, can counteract all reactions of past material\ninfections, which are impediments to the progress of self-realization. On the\nother hand, one who does not do so continues to increase the volume of sinful\naction, and this prepares the next body to resemble hogs and dogs, to suffer the\nresultant reactions of all sins. The material world is full of contaminations,\nand one who is immunized by accepting pras\u0101dam of the Lord (food offered to\nVi\u1e63\u1e47u) is saved from the attack, whereas one who does not do so becomes\nsubjected to contamination.\n\n\nFood grains or vegetables are factually eatables. The human being eats different\nkinds of food grains, vegetables, fruits, etc., and the animals eat the refuse\nof the food grains and vegetables, grass, plants, etc. Human beings who are\naccustomed to eating meat and flesh must also depend on the production of\nvegetation in order to eat the animals. Therefore, ultimately, we have to depend\non the production of the field and not on the production of big factories. The\nfield production is due to sufficient rain from the sky, and such rains are\ncontrolled by demigods like Indra, sun, moon, etc., and they are all servants of\nthe Lord. The Lord can be satisfied by sacrifices; therefore, one who cannot\nperform them will find himself in scarcity\u2014that is the law of nature. Yaj\u00f1a,\nspecifically the sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-yaj\u00f1a prescribed for this age, must therefore be\nperformed to save us at least from scarcity of food supply.\n\n\n3.15\n\n\nkarma brahmodbhava\u1e41 viddhi\n\n\nbrahm\u0101k\u1e63ara-samudbhavam\n\n\ntasm\u0101t sarva-gata\u1e41 brahma\n\n\nnitya\u1e41 yaj\u00f1e prati\u1e63\u1e6dhitam\n\n\nkarma\u2014work; brahma\u2014Vedas; udbhavam\u2014produced from; viddhi\u2014one should know;\nbrahma\u2014the Vedas; ak\u1e63ara\u2014the Supreme Brahman (Personality of Godhead);\nsamudbhavam; directly manifested; tasm\u0101t\u2014therefore; sarva-gatam\u2014all-pervading;\nbrahma\u2014Transcendence; nityam\u2014eternally; yaj\u00f1e\u2014in sacrifice;\nprati\u1e63\u1e6dhitam\u2014situated.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nRegulated activities are prescribed in the Vedas, and the Vedas are directly\nmanifested from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Consequently the\nall-pervading Transcendence is eternally situated in acts of sacrifice.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nYaj\u00f1\u0101rtha karma, or the necessity of work for the satisfaction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a only, is\nmore expressly stated in this verse. If we have to work for the satisfaction of\nthe yaj\u00f1a-puru\u1e63a, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, then we must find out the direction of work in Brahman,\nor the transcendental Vedas. The Vedas are therefore codes of working\ndirections. Anything performed without the direction of the Vedas is called\nvikarma, or unauthorized or sinful work. Therefore, one should always take\ndirection from the Vedas to be saved from the reaction of work. As one has to\nwork in ordinary life by the direction of the state, similarly, one has to work\nunder direction of the supreme state of the Lord. Such directions in the Vedas\nare directly manifested from the breathing of the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead. It is said: asya mahato bh\u016btasya na\u015bvasitam etad yad \u1e5bg-vedo\nyajur-veda\u1e25 s\u0101ma-vedo \u2019tharv\u0101\u1e45 girasa\u1e25. \u201cThe four Vedas\u2014namely the \u1e5ag-veda,\nYajur-veda, S\u0101ma-veda and Atharva-veda\u2014are all emanations from the breathing of\nthe great Personality of Godhead.\u201d The Lord, being omnipotent, can speak by\nbreathing air, as it is confirmed in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101, for the Lord has the\nomnipotence to perform through each of His senses the actions of all other\nsenses. In other words, the Lord can speak through His breathing, and He can\nimpregnate by His eyes. In fact, it is said that He glanced over material nature\nand thus fathered all living entities. After creating or impregnating the\nconditioned souls into the womb of material nature, He gave His directions in\nthe Vedic wisdom as to how such conditioned souls can return home, back to\nGodhead. We should always remember that the conditioned souls in material nature\nare all eager for material enjoyment. But the Vedic directions are so made that\none can satisfy one\u2019s perverted desires, then return to Godhead, having finished\nhis so-called enjoyment. It is a chance for the conditioned souls to attain\nliberation; therefore the conditioned souls must try to follow the process of\nyaj\u00f1a by becoming K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious. Even those who cannot follow the Vedic\ninjunctions may adopt the principles of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, and that will take\nthe place of performance of Vedic yaj\u00f1as, or karmas.\n\n\n3.16\n\n\neva\u1e41 pravartita\u1e41 cakra\u1e41\n\n\nn\u0101nuvartayat\u012bha ya\u1e25\n\n\nagh\u0101yur indriy\u0101r\u0101mo\n\n\nmogha\u1e41 p\u0101rtha sa j\u012bvati\n\n\nevam\u2014thus prescribed; pravartitam\u2014established by the Vedas; cakram\u2014cycle;\nna\u2014does not; anuvartayati\u2014adopt; iha\u2014in this life; ya\u1e25\u2014one who; agh\u0101yu\u1e25\u2014life\nfull of sins; indriya-\u0101r\u0101ma\u1e25\u2014satisfied in sense gratification; mogham\u2014useless;\np\u0101rtha\u2014O son of P\u1e5bth\u0101 (Arjuna); sa\u1e25\u2014one who does so; j\u012bvati\u2014lives.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nMy dear Arjuna, a man who does not follow this prescribed Vedic system of\nsacrifice certainly leads a life of sin, for a person delighting only in the\nsenses lives in vain.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe mammonist philosophy of work very hard and enjoy sense gratification is\ncondemned herein by the Lord. Therefore, for those who want to enjoy this\nmaterial world, the above-mentioned cycle of performing yaj\u00f1as is absolutely\nnecessary. One who does not follow such regulations is living a very risky life,\nbeing condemned more and more. By nature\u2019s law, this human form of life is\nspecifically meant for self-realization, in either of the three ways\u2014namely\nkarma-yoga, j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga, or bhakti-yoga. There is no necessity of rigidly\nfollowing the performances of the prescribed yaj\u00f1as for the transcendentalists\nwho are above vice and virtue; but those who are engaged in sense gratification\nrequire purification by the above-mentioned cycle of yaj\u00f1a performances. There\nare different kinds of activities. Those who are not K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious are\ncertainly engaged in sensory consciousness; therefore they need to execute pious\nwork. The yaj\u00f1a system is planned in such a way that sensory conscious persons\nmay satisfy their desires without becoming entangled in the reaction of\nsense-gratificatory work. The prosperity of the world depends not on our own\nefforts but on the background arrangement of the Supreme Lord, directly carried\nout by the demigods. Therefore, the yaj\u00f1as are directly aimed at the particular\ndemigod mentioned in the Vedas. Indirectly, it is the practice of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness, because when one masters the performance of yaj\u00f1as, one is sure\nto become K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious. But if by performing yaj\u00f1as one does not become K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconscious, such principles are counted as only moral codes. One should not,\ntherefore, limit his progress only to the point of moral codes, but should\ntranscend them, to attain K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\n\n\n3.17\n\n\nyas tv \u0101tma-ratir eva sy\u0101d\n\n\n\u0101tma-t\u1e5bpta\u015b ca m\u0101nava\u1e25\n\n\n\u0101tmany eva ca santu\u1e63\u1e6das\n\n\ntasya k\u0101rya\u1e41 na vidyate\n\n\nya\u1e25\u2014one who; tu\u2014but; \u0101tma-rati\u1e25\u2014takes pleasure; eva\u2014certainly; sy\u0101t\u2014remains;\n\u0101tma-t\u1e5bpta\u1e25\u2014self-illuminated; ca\u2014and; m\u0101nava\u1e25\u2014a man; \u0101tmani\u2014in himself;\neva\u2014only; ca\u2014and; santu\u1e63\u1e6da\u1e25\u2014perfectly satiated; tasya\u2014his; k\u0101ryam\u2014duty; na\u2014does\nnot; vidyate\u2014exist.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nOne who is, however, taking pleasure in the self, who is illumined in the self,\nwho rejoices in and is satisfied with the self only, fully satiated\u2014for him\nthere is no duty.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nA person who is fully K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, and is fully satisfied by his acts in\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, no longer has any duty to perform.

By such clearing of consciousness, one becomes\nfully confident of his eternal position in relationship with the Supreme. His\nduty thus becomes self-illuminated by the grace of the Lord, and therefore he no\nlonger has any obligations to the Vedic injunctions.

A person, therefore, acting for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness, under proper guidance and without attachment to the result of the\nwork, is certainly making progress toward the supreme goal of life.

To be a good man or a nonviolent man is a\npersonal attachment, but to act on behalf of the Supreme is to act without\nattachment for the result. That is perfect action of the highest degree,\nrecommended by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Vedic rituals,\nlike prescribed sacrifices, are performed for purification of impious activities\nthat were performed in the field of sense gratification. But action in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness is transcendental to the reactions of good or evil work. A K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconscious person has no attachment for the result but acts on behalf of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nalone.

Nonetheless they\nperformed all prescribed activities just to set examples for the people in\ngeneral. Janaka was the father of S\u012bt\u0101, and father-in-law of Lord \u015ar\u012b R\u0101ma.\nBeing a great devotee of the Lord, he was transcendentally situated, but because\nhe was the King of Mithila (a subdivision of Behar province in India), he had to\nteach his subjects how to fight righteously in battle. He and his subjects\nfought to teach people in general that violence is also necessary in a situation\nwhere good arguments fail. Before the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra, every effort was\nmade to avoid the war, even by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but the other\nparty was determined to fight. So for such a right cause, there is a necessity\nfor fighting. Although one who is situated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness may not have\nany interest in the world, he still works to teach the public how to live and\nhow to act. Experienced persons in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness can act in such a way\nthat others will follow, and this is explained in the following verse.\n\n\n3.21\n\n\nyad yad \u0101carati \u015bre\u1e63\u1e6dhas\n\n\ntat tad evetaro jana\u1e25\n\n\nsa yat pram\u0101\u1e47a\u1e41 kurute\n\n\nlokas tad anuvartate\n\n\nyat\u2014whatever; yat\u2014and whichever; \u0101carati\u2014does he act; \u015bre\u1e63\u1e6dha\u1e25\u2014respectable\nleader; tat\u2014that; tat\u2014and that alone; eva\u2014certainly; itara\u1e25\u2014common;\njana\u1e25\u2014person; sa\u1e25\u2014he; yat\u2014whichever; pram\u0101\u1e47am\u2014evidence; kurute\u2014does perform;\nloka\u1e25\u2014all the world; tat\u2014that; anuvartate\u2014follow in the footsteps.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nWhatever action is performed by a great man, common men follow in his footsteps.\nAnd whatever standards he sets by exemplary acts, all the world pursues.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nPeople in general always require a leader who can teach the public by practical\nbehavior. A leader cannot teach the public to stop smoking if he himself smokes.\nLord Caitanya said that a teacher should behave properly even before he begins\nteaching. One who teaches in that way is called \u0101c\u0101rya, or the ideal teacher.\nTherefore, a teacher must follow the principles of \u015b\u0101\u015btra (scripture) to reach\nthe common man. The teacher cannot manufacture rules against the principles of\nrevealed scriptures. The revealed scriptures, like Manu-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 and similar\nothers, are considered the standard books to be followed by human society. Thus\nthe leader\u2019s teaching should be based on the principles of the standard rules as\nthey are practiced by the great teachers. The \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam also affirms\nthat one should follow in the footsteps of great devotees, and that is the way\nof progress on the path of spiritual realization. The king or the executive head\nof a state, the father and the school teacher are all considered to be natural\nleaders of the innocent people in general. All such natural leaders have a great\nresponsibility to their dependants; therefore they must be conversant with\nstandard books of moral and spiritual codes.\n\n\n3.22\n\n\nna me p\u0101rth\u0101sti kartavya\u1e41\n\n\ntri\u1e63u loke\u1e63u ki\u00f1cana\n\n\nn\u0101nav\u0101ptam av\u0101ptavya\u1e41\n\n\nvarta eva ca karma\u1e47i\n\n\nna\u2014none; me\u2014Mine; p\u0101rtha\u2014O son of P\u1e5bth\u0101; asti\u2014there is; kartavyam\u2014any prescribed\nduty; tri\u1e63u\u2014in the three; loke\u1e63u\u2014planetary systems; ki\u00f1cana\u2014anything; na\u2014no;\nanav\u0101ptam\u2014in want; av\u0101ptavyam\u2014to be gained; varte\u2014engaged; eva\u2014certainly;\nca\u2014also; karma\u1e47i\u2014in one\u2019s prescribed duty.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nO son of P\u1e5bth\u0101, there is no work prescribed for Me within all the three\nplanetary systems.

He is also worshipable by all demigods and is the\nsupreme director of all directors. Therefore, He is transcendental to all kinds\nof material leaders and controllers and is worshipable by all. There is no one\ngreater than Him, and He is the supreme cause of all causes.\n\n\n\u201cHe does not possess bodily form like that of an ordinary living entity. There\nis no difference between His body and His soul. He is absolute. All His senses\nare transcendental. Any one of His senses can perform the action of any other\nsense. Therefore, no one is greater than Him or equal to Him. His potencies are\nmultifarious, and thus His deeds are automatically performed as a natural\nsequence.\u201d (\u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad 6.7\u20138)\n\n\nSince everything is in full opulence in the Personality of Godhead and is\nexisting in full truth, there is no duty for the Supreme Personality of Godhead\nto perform. One who must receive the results of work has some designated duty,\nbut one who has nothing to achieve within the three planetary systems certainly\nhas no duty. And yet Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is engaged on the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra as\nthe leader of the k\u1e63atriyas because the k\u1e63atriyas are duty-bound to give\nprotection to the distressed.

Otherwise, common men would follow in His footsteps\nbecause He is the greatest authority. From the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam it is\nunderstood that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was performing all the religious duties at home and\nout of home, as required of a householder.\n\n\n3.24\n\n\nuts\u012bdeyur ime lok\u0101\n\n\nna kury\u0101\u1e41 karma ced aham\n\n\nsa\u1e45karasya ca kart\u0101 sy\u0101m\n\n\nupahany\u0101m im\u0101\u1e25 praj\u0101\u1e25\n\n\nuts\u012bdeyu\u1e25\u2014put into ruin; ime\u2014all these; lok\u0101\u1e25\u2014worlds; na\u2014do not; kury\u0101m\u2014perform;\nkarma\u2014prescribed duties; cet\u2014if; aham\u2014I; sa\u1e45karasya\u2014of unwanted population;\nca\u2014and; kart\u0101\u2014creator; sy\u0101m\u2014shall be; upahany\u0101m\u2014destroy; im\u0101\u1e25\u2014all these;\npraj\u0101\u1e25\u2014living entities.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nIf I should cease to work, then all these worlds would be put to ruination.

In order to check this social disturbance, there are prescribed rules\nand regulations by which the population can automatically become peaceful and\norganized for spiritual progress in life. When Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a descends, naturally He\ndeals with such rules and regulations in order to maintain the prestige and\nnecessity of such important performances. The Lord is the father of all living\nentities, and if the living entities are misguided, indirectly the\nresponsibility goes to the Lord. Therefore, whenever there is general disregard\nof regulative principles, the Lord Himself descends and corrects the society. We\nshould, however, note carefully that although we have to follow in the footsteps\nof the Lord, we still have to remember that we cannot imitate Him. Following and\nimitating are not on the same level. We cannot imitate the Lord by lifting\nGovardhana Hill, as the Lord did in His childhood. It is impossible for any\nhuman being. We have to follow His instructions, but we may not imitate Him at\nany time. The \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam affirms:\n\n\nnaitat sam\u0101carej j\u0101tu manas\u0101pi hy an\u012b\u015bvara\u1e25 vina\u015byaty \u0101caran mau\u1e0dhy\u0101d yath\u0101\n\u2019rudro \u2019bdhija\u1e41 vi\u1e63am\n\n\n\u012b\u015bvar\u0101\u1e47\u0101\u1e41 vaca\u1e25 satya\u1e41 tathaiv\u0101carita\u1e41 kvacit te\u1e63\u0101\u1e41 yat sva-vaco yukta\u1e41\nbuddhim\u0101\u1e41s tat sam\u0101caret\n\n\n\u201cOne should simply follow the instructions of the Lord and His empowered\nservants. Their instructions are all good for us, and any intelligent person\nwill perform them as instructed. However, one should guard against trying to\nimitate their actions. One should not try to drink the ocean of poison in\nimitation of Lord \u015aiva.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 10.33.30)\n\n\nWe should always consider the position of the \u012b\u015bvaras, or those who can actually\ncontrol the movements of the sun and moon, as superior. Without such power, one\ncannot imitate the \u012b\u015bvaras, who are superpowerful. Lord \u015aiva drank poison to the\nextent of swallowing an ocean, but if any common man tries to drink even a\nfragment of such poison, he will be killed. There are many psuedo-devotees of\nLord \u015aiva who want to indulge in smoking g\u0101\u00f1j\u0101 (marijuana) and similar\nintoxicating drugs, forgetting that by so imitating the acts of Lord \u015aiva they\nare calling death very near. Similarly, there are some psuedo-devotees of Lord\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a who prefer to imitate the Lord in His r\u0101sa-l\u012bl\u0101, or dance of love,\nforgetting their inability to lift Govardhana Hill. It is best, therefore, that\none not try to imitate the powerful, but simply follow their instructions; nor\nshould one try to occupy their posts without qualification.

All\nrituals, all performances of sacrifices, and everything that is put into the\nVedas, including all directions for material activities, are meant for\nunderstanding K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who is the ultimate goal of life. But because the\nconditioned souls do not know anything beyond sense gratification, they study\nthe Vedas to that end. Through sense regulations, however, one is gradually\nelevated to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Therefore a realized soul in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness should not disturb others in their activities or understanding,\nbut he should act by showing how the results of all work can be dedicated to the\nservice of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The learned K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person may act in such a way that\nthe ignorant person working for sense gratification may learn how to act and how\nto behave. Although the ignorant man is not to be disturbed in his activities,\nstill, a slightly developed K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person may directly be engaged in\nthe service of the Lord without waiting for other Vedic formulas. For this\nfortunate man there is no need to follow the Vedic rituals, because in direct\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness one can have all the results simply by following the\nprescribed duties of a particular person.\n\n\n3.27\n\n\nprak\u1e5bte\u1e25 kriyam\u0101\u1e47\u0101ni\n\n\ngu\u1e47ai\u1e25 karm\u0101\u1e47i sarva\u015ba\u1e25\n\n\naha\u1e45k\u0101ra-vim\u016b\u1e0dh\u0101tm\u0101\n\n\nkart\u0101ham iti manyate\n\n\nprak\u1e5bte\u1e25\u2014of material nature; kriyam\u0101\u1e47\u0101ni\u2014all being done; gu\u1e47ai\u1e25\u2014by the modes;\nkarm\u0101\u1e47i\u2014activities; sarva\u015ba\u1e25\u2014all kinds of; aha\u1e45k\u0101ra-vim\u016b\u1e0dha\u2014bewildered by false\nego; \u0101tm\u0101\u2014the spirit soul; kart\u0101\u2014doer; aham\u2014I; iti\u2014thus; manyate\u2014thinks.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThe bewildered spirit soul, under the influence of the three modes of material\nnature, thinks himself to be the doer of activities, which are in actuality\ncarried out by nature.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nTwo persons, one in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and the other in material consciousness,\nworking on the same level, may appear to be working on the same platform, but\nthere is a wide gulf of difference in their respective positions. The person in\nmaterial consciousness is convinced by false ego that he is the doer of\neverything. He does not know that the mechanism of the body is produced by\nmaterial nature, which works under the supervision of the Supreme Lord. The\nmaterialistic person has no knowledge that ultimately he is under the control of\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The person in false ego takes all credit for doing everything\nindependantly, and that is the symptom of his nescience. He does not know that\nthis gross and subtle body is the creation of material nature, under the order\nof the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and as such his bodily and mental\nactivities should be engaged in the service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\nThe ignorant man forgets that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is known as\nH\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba, or the master of the senses of the material body, for due to his long\nmisuse of the senses in sense gratification, he is factually bewildered by the\nfalse ego, which makes him forget his eternal relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\n\n\n3.28\n\n\ntattva-vit tu mah\u0101-b\u0101ho\n\n\ngu\u1e47a-karma-vibh\u0101gayo\u1e25\n\n\ngu\u1e47\u0101 gu\u1e47e\u1e63u vartanta\n\n\niti matv\u0101 na sajjate\n\n\ntattvavit\u2014the knower of the Absolute Truth; tu\u2014but; mah\u0101-b\u0101ho\u2014O mighty-armed\none; gu\u1e47a-karma\u2014works under material influence; vibh\u0101gayo\u1e25\u2014differences;\ngu\u1e47\u0101\u1e25\u2014senses; gu\u1e47e\u1e63u\u2014in sense gratification; vartante\u2014being engaged; iti\u2014thus;\nmatv\u0101\u2014thinking; na\u2014never; sajjate\u2014becomes attached.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nOne who is in knowledge of the Absolute Truth, O mighty-armed, does not engage\nhimself in the senses and sense gratification, knowing well the differences\nbetween work in devotion and work for fruitive results.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe knower of the Absolute Truth is convinced of his awkward position in\nmaterial association. He knows that he is part and parcel of the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and that his position should not be in the\nmaterial creation. He knows his real identity as part and parcel of the Supreme,\nwho is eternal bliss and knowledge, and he realizes that somehow or other he is\nentrapped in the material conception of life. In his pure state of existence he\nis meant to dovetail his activities in devotional service to the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He therefore engages himself in the activities of\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and becomes naturally unattached to the activities of the\nmaterial senses, which are all circumstantial and temporary. He knows that his\nmaterial condition of life is under the supreme control of the Lord;\nconsequently he is not disturbed by all kinds of material reactions, which he\nconsiders to be the mercy of the Lord. According to \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, one who\nknows the Absolute Truth in three different features\u2014namely Brahman, Param\u0101tm\u0101,\nand the Supreme Personality of Godhead\u2014is called tattvavit, for he knows also\nhis own factual position in relationship with the Supreme.\n\n\n3.29\n\n\nprak\u1e5bter gu\u1e47a-samm\u016b\u1e0dh\u0101\u1e25\n\n\nsajjante gu\u1e47a-karmasu\n\n\nt\u0101n ak\u1e5btsna-vido mand\u0101n\n\n\nk\u1e5btsna-vin na vic\u0101layet\n\n\nprak\u1e5bte\u1e25\u2014impelled by the material modes; gu\u1e47a-sa\u1e41m\u016b\u1e0dh\u0101\u1e25\u2014befooled by material\nidentification; sajjante\u2014become engaged; gu\u1e47a-karmasu\u2014in material activities;\nt\u0101n\u2014all those; ak\u1e5btsna-vida\u1e25\u2014persons with a poor fund of knowledge; mand\u0101n\u2014lazy\nto understand self-realization; k\u1e5btsna-vit\u2014one who is in factual knowledge;\nna\u2014may not; vic\u0101layet\u2014try to agitate.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nBewildered by the modes of material nature, the ignorant fully engage themselves\nin material activities and become attached. But the wise should not unsettle\nthem, although these duties are inferior due to the performers\u2019 lack of\nknowledge.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nPersons who are unknowledgeable falsely identify with gross material\nconsciousness and are full of material designations. This body is a gift of the\nmaterial nature, and one who is too much attached to the bodily consciousness is\ncalled mand\u0101n, or a lazy person without understanding of spirit soul. Ignorant\nmen think of the body as the self; bodily connections with others are accepted\nas kinsmanship; the land in which the body is obtained is the object of worship;\nand the formalities of religious rituals are considered ends in themselves.\nSocial work, nationalism, and altruism are some of the activities for such\nmaterially designated persons. Under the spell of such designations, they are\nalways busy in the material field; for them spiritual realization is a myth, and\nso they are not interested. Such bewildered persons may even be engaged in such\nprimary moral principles of life as nonviolence and similar materially\nbenevolent work. Those who are, however, enlightened in spiritual life, should\nnot try to agitate such materially engrossed persons. Better to prosecute one\u2019s\nown spiritual activities silently.\n\n\nMen who are ignorant cannot appreciate activities in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, and\ntherefore Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a advises us not to disturb them and simply waste valuable\ntime. But the devotees of the Lord are more kind than the Lord because they\nunderstand the purpose of the Lord. Consequently they undertake all kinds of\nrisks, even to the point of approaching ignorant men to try to engage them in\nthe acts of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, which are absolutely necessary for the human\nbeing.\n\n\n3.30\n\n\nmayi sarv\u0101\u1e47i karm\u0101\u1e47i\n\n\nsannyasy\u0101dhy\u0101tma-cetas\u0101\n\n\nnir\u0101\u015b\u012br nirmamo bh\u016btv\u0101\n\n\nyudhyasva vigata-jvara\u1e25\n\n\nmayi\u2014unto Me; sarv\u0101\u1e47i\u2014all sorts of; karm\u0101\u1e47i\u2014activities; sannyasya\u2014giving up\ncompletely; adhy\u0101tma\u2014with full knowledge of the self; cetas\u0101\u2014consciousness;\nnir\u0101\u015b\u012b\u1e25\u2014without desire for profit; nirmama\u1e25\u2014without ownership; bh\u016btv\u0101\u2014so being;\nyudhyasva\u2014fight; vigata-jvara\u1e25\u2014without being lethargic.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nTherefore, O Arjuna, surrendering all your works unto Me, with mind intent on\nMe, and without desire for gain and free from egoism and lethargy, fight.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThis verse clearly indicates the purpose of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. The Lord\ninstructs that one has to become fully K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious to discharge duties, as\nif in military discipline. Such an injunction may make things a little\ndifficult; nevertheless duties must be carried out, with dependence on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a,\nbecause that is the constitutional position of the living entity. The living\nentity cannot be happy independant of the cooperation of the Supreme Lord\nbecause the eternal constitutional position of the living entity is to become\nsubordinate to the desires of the Lord. Arjuna was, therefore, ordered by \u015ar\u012b\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to fight as if the Lord were his military commander. One has to sacrifice\neverything for the good will of the Supreme Lord, and at the same time discharge\nprescribed duties without claiming proprietorship. Arjuna did not have to\nconsider the order of the Lord; he had only to execute His order. The Supreme\nLord is the Soul of all souls; therefore, one who depends solely and wholly on\nthe Supreme Soul without personal consideration, or in other words, one who is\nfully K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, is called adhy\u0101tma-cetas\u0101. Nir\u0101\u015b\u012b\u1e25 means that one has to\nact on the order of the master. Nor should one ever expect fruitive results. The\ncashier may count millions of dollars for his employer, but he does not claim a\ncent for himself. Similarly, one has to realize that nothing in the world\nbelongs to any individual person, but that everything belongs to the Supreme\nLord. That is the real purport of mayi, or unto Me. And when one acts in such\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, certainly he does not claim proprietorship over anything.\nThis consciousness is called nirmama, or nothing is mine. And, if there is any\nreluctance to execute such a stern order which is without consideration of\nso-called kinsmen in the bodily relationship, that reluctance should be thrown\noff; in this way one may become vigata-jvara, or without feverish mentality or\nlethargy. Everyone, according to his quality and position, has a particular type\nof work to discharge, and all such duties may be discharged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness, as described above. That will lead one to the path of liberation.\n\n\n3.31\n\n\nye me matam ida\u1e41 nityam\n\n\nanuti\u1e63\u1e6dhanti m\u0101nav\u0101\u1e25\n\n\n\u015braddh\u0101vanto \u2019nas\u016byanto\n\n\nmucyante te \u2019pi karmabhi\u1e25\n\n\nye\u2014those; me\u2014My; matam\u2014injunctions; idam\u2014this; nityam\u2014eternal function;\nanuti\u1e63\u1e6dhanti\u2014execute regularly; m\u0101nav\u0101\u1e25\u2014humankind; \u015braddh\u0101vanta\u1e25\u2014with faith and\ndevotion; anas\u016byanta\u1e25\u2014without envy; mucyante\u2014become free; te\u2014all of them;\napi\u2014even; karmabhi\u1e25\u2014from the bondage of the law of fruitive action.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nOne who executes his duties according to My injunctions and who follows this\nteaching faithfully, without envy, becomes free from the bondage of fruitive\nactions.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe injunction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is the essence of\nall Vedic wisdom, and therefore is eternally true without exception. As the\nVedas are eternal, so this truth of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is also eternal. One\nshould have firm faith in this injunction, without envying the Lord. There are\nmany philosophers who write comments on the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 but have no faith in\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. They will never be liberated from the bondage of fruitive action. But an\nordinary man with firm faith in the eternal injunctions of the Lord, even though\nunable to execute such orders, becomes liberated from the bondage of the law of\nkarma. In the beginning of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, one may not fully discharge the\ninjunctions of the Lord, but because one is not resentful of this principle and\nworks sincerely without consideration of defeat and hopelessness, he will surely\nbe promoted to the stage of pure K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\n\n\n3.32\n\n\nye tv etad abhyas\u016byanto\n\n\nn\u0101nuti\u1e63\u1e6dhanti me matam\n\n\nsarva-j\u00f1\u0101na-vim\u016b\u1e0dh\u0101\u1e41s t\u0101n\n\n\nviddhi na\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101n acetasa\u1e25\n\n\nye\u2014those; tu\u2014however; etat\u2014this; abhyas\u016byanta\u1e25\u2014out of envy; na\u2014do not;\nanuti\u1e63\u1e6dhanti\u2014regularly perform; me\u2014My; matam\u2014injunction; sarva-j\u00f1\u0101na\u2014all sorts\nof knowledge; vim\u016b\u1e0dh\u0101n\u2014perfectly befooled; t\u0101n\u2014they are; viddhi\u2014know it well;\nna\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101n\u2014all ruined; acetasa\u1e25\u2014without K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nBut those who, out of envy, disregard these teachings and do not practice them\nregularly, are to be considered bereft of all knowledge, befooled, and doomed to\nignorance and bondage.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe flaw of not being K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious is clearly stated herein. As there is\npunishment for disobedience to the order of the supreme executive head, so there\nis certainly punishment for the disobedience of the order of the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead. A disobedient person, however great he may be, is\nignorant of his own self, of the Supreme Brahman, and Param\u0101tm\u0101 and the\nPersonality of Godhead, due to a vacant heart.

What can repression accomplish?\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nUnless one is situated on the transcendental platform of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, he\ncannot get free from the influence of the modes of material nature, as it is\nconfirmed by the Lord in the Seventh Chapter (7.14). Therefore, even for the\nmost highly educated person on the mundane plane, it is impossible to get out of\nthe entanglement of m\u0101y\u0101 simply by theoretical knowledge, or by separating the\nsoul from the body. There are many so-called spiritualists who outwardly pose to\nbe advanced in the science, but inwardly or privately are completely under the\nparticular modes of nature which they are unable to surpass. Academically, one\nmay be very learned, but because of his long association with material nature,\nhe is in bondage. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness helps one to get out of the material\nentanglement, even though one may be engaged in his prescribed duties.\nTherefore, without being fully in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, no one should suddenly\ngive up his prescribed duties and become a so-called yog\u012b or transcendentalist\nartificially. It is better to be situated in one\u2019s position and to try to attain\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness under superior training. Thus one may be freed from the\nclutches of m\u0101y\u0101.\n\n\n3.34\n\n\nindriyasyendriyasy\u0101rthe\n\n\nr\u0101ga-dve\u1e63au vyavasthitau\n\n\ntayor na va\u015bam \u0101gacchet\n\n\ntau hy asya paripanthinau\n\n\nindriyasya\u2014of the senses; indriyasya arthe\u2014in the sense objects;\nr\u0101ga\u2014attachment; dve\u1e63au\u2014also in detachment; vyavasthitau\u2014put under regulations;\ntayo\u1e25\u2014of them; na\u2014never; va\u015bam\u2014control; \u0101gacchet\u2014one should come; tau\u2014those;\nhi\u2014certainly are; asya\u2014his; paripanthinau\u2014stumbling blocks.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nAttraction and repulsion for sense objects are felt by embodied beings, but one\nshould not fall under the control of senses and sense objects because they are\nstumbling blocks on the path of self-realization.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThose who are in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness are naturally reluctant to engage in\nmaterial sense gratifications. But those who are not in such consciousness\nshould follow the rules and regulations of the revealed scriptures. Unrestricted\nsense enjoyment is the cause of material encagement, but one who follows the\nrules and regulations of the revealed scriptures does not become entangled by\nthe sense objects. For example, sex enjoyment is a necessity for the conditioned\nsoul, and sex enjoyment is allowed under the license of marriage ties. For\nexample, according to scriptural injunctions, one is forbidden to engage in sex\nrelationships with any women other than one\u2019s wife. All other women are to be\nconsidered as one\u2019s mother. But, in spite of such injunctions, a man is still\ninclined to have sex relationships with other women. These propensities are to\nbe curbed; otherwise they will be stumbling blocks on the path of\nself-realization. As long as the material body is there, the necessities of the\nmaterial body are allowed, but under rules and regulations. And yet, we should\nnot rely upon the control of such allowances. One has to follow those rules and\nregulations, unattached to them, because practice of sense gratifications under\nregulations may also lead one to go astray\u2014as much as there is always the chance\nof an accident, even on the royal roads. Although they may be very carefully\nmaintained, no one can guarantee that there will be no danger even on the safest\nroad. The sense enjoyment spirit has been current a very long, long time, owing\nto material association. Therefore, in spite of regulated sense enjoyment, there\nis every chance of falling down; therefore any attachment for regulated sense\nenjoyment must also be avoided by all means. But action in the loving service of\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a detaches one from all kinds of sensory activities. Therefore, no one\nshould try to be detached from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness at any stage of life. The\nwhole purpose of detachment from all kinds of sense attachment is ultimately to\nbecome situated on the platform of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\n\n\n3.35\n\n\n\u015brey\u0101n sva-dharmo vigu\u1e47a\u1e25\n\n\npara-dharm\u0101t sv-anu\u1e63\u1e6dhit\u0101t\n\n\nsva-dharme nidhana\u1e41 \u015breya\u1e25\n\n\npara-dharmo bhay\u0101vaha\u1e25\n\n\n\u015brey\u0101n\u2014far better; sva-dharma\u1e25\u2014one\u2019s prescribed duties; vigu\u1e47a\u1e25\u2014even faulty;\npara-dharm\u0101t\u2014from duties mentioned for others; svanu\u1e63thit\u0101t\u2014than perfectly done;\nsva-dharme\u2014in one\u2019s prescribed duties; nidhanam\u2014destruction; \u015breya\u1e25\u2014better;\npara-dharma\u1e25\u2014duties prescribed for others; bhaya-\u0101vaha\u1e25\u2014dangerous.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nIt is far better to discharge one\u2019s prescribed duties, even though they may be\nfaulty, than another\u2019s duties. Destruction in the course of performing one\u2019s own\nduty is better than engaging in another\u2019s duties, for to follow another\u2019s path\nis dangerous.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nOne should therefore discharge his prescribed duties in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness\nrather than those prescribed for others. Prescribed duties complement one\u2019s\npsychophysical condition, under the spell of the modes of material nature.\nSpiritual duties are as ordered by the spiritual master, for the transcendental\nservice of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. But both materially or spiritually, one should stick to his\nprescribed duties even up to death, rather than imitate another\u2019s prescribed\nduties. Duties on the spiritual platform and duties on the material platform may\nbe different, but the principle of following the authorized direction is always\ngood for the performer. When one is under the spell of the modes of material\nnature, one should follow the prescribed rules for particular situations and\nshould not imitate others. For example, a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, who is in the mode of\ngoodness, is nonviolent, whereas a k\u1e63atriya, who is in the mode of passion, is\nallowed to be violent. As such, for a k\u1e63atriya it is better to be vanquished\nfollowing the rules of violence than to imitate a br\u0101hma\u1e47a who follows the\nprinciples of nonviolence. Everyone has to cleanse his heart by a gradual\nprocess, not abruptly. However, when one transcends the modes of material nature\nand is fully situated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, he can perform anything and\neverything under the direction of the bona fide spiritual master. In that\ncomplete stage of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, the k\u1e63atriya may act as a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, or a\nbr\u0101hma\u1e47a may act as a k\u1e63atriya. In the transcendental stage, the distinctions of\nthe material world do not apply. For example, Vi\u015bv\u0101mitra was originally a\nk\u1e63atriya, but later on he acted as a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, whereas Para\u015bur\u0101ma was a\nbr\u0101hma\u1e47a, but later on he acted as a k\u1e63atriya. Being transcendentally situated,\nthey could do so; but as long as one is on the material platform, he must\nperform his duties according to the modes of material nature. At the same time,\nhe must have a full sense of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\n\n\n3.36\n\n\narjuna uv\u0101ca\n\n\natha kena prayukto \u2019ya\u1e41\n\n\np\u0101pa\u1e41 carati p\u016bru\u1e63a\u1e25\n\n\nanicchann api v\u0101r\u1e63\u1e47eya\n\n\nbal\u0101d iva niyojita\u1e25\n\n\narjuna\u1e25 uv\u0101ca\u2014Arjuna said; atha\u2014hereafter; kena\u2014by what; prayukta\u1e25\u2014impelled;\nayam\u2014one; p\u0101pam\u2014sins; carati\u2014acts; p\u016bru\u1e63a\u1e25\u2014a man; anicchan\u2014without desiring;\napi\u2014although; v\u0101r\u1e63\u1e47eya\u2014O descendant of V\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47i; bal\u0101t\u2014by force; iva\u2014as if;\nniyojita\u1e25\u2014engaged.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nArjuna said: O descendant of V\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47i, by what is one impelled to sinful acts, even\nunwillingly, as if engaged by force?\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nA living entity, as part and parcel of the Supreme, is originally spiritual,\npure, and free from all material contaminations. Therefore, by nature he is not\nsubjected to the sins of the material world. But when he is in contact with the\nmaterial nature, he acts in many sinful ways without hesitation, and sometimes\neven against his will. As such, Arjuna\u2019s question to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is very sanguine, as\nto the perverted nature of the living entities. Although the living entity\nsometimes does not want to act in sin, he is still forced to act. Sinful actions\nare not, however, impelled by the Supersoul within, but are due to another\ncause, as the Lord explains in the next verse.\n\n\n3.37\n\n\n\u015br\u012b-bhagav\u0101n uv\u0101ca\n\n\nk\u0101ma e\u1e63a krodha e\u1e63a\n\n\nrajo-gu\u1e47a-samudbhava\u1e25\n\n\nmah\u0101\u015bano mah\u0101-p\u0101pm\u0101\n\n\nviddhy enam iha vairi\u1e47am\n\n\n\u015br\u012b bhagav\u0101n uv\u0101ca\u2014the Personality of Godhead said; k\u0101ma\u1e25\u2014lust; e\u1e63a\u1e25\u2014all these;\nkrodha\u1e25\u2014wrath; e\u1e63a\u1e25\u2014all these; rajo-gu\u1e47a\u2014the mode of passion; samudbhava\u1e25\u2014born\nof; mah\u0101-\u015bana\u1e25\u2014all-devouring; mah\u0101-p\u0101pm\u0101\u2014greatly sinful; viddhi\u2014know; enam\u2014this;\niha\u2014in the material world; vairi\u1e47am\u2014greatest enemy.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThe Blessed Lord said: It is lust only, Arjuna, which is born of contact with\nthe material modes of passion and later transformed into wrath, and which is the\nall-devouring, sinful enemy of this world.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nWhen a living entity comes in contact with the material creation, his eternal\nlove for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is transformed into lust, in association with the mode of\npassion. Or, in other words, the sense of love of God becomes transformed into\nlust, as milk in contact with sour tamarind is transformed into yogurt. Then\nagain, when lust is unsatisfied, it turns into wrath; wrath is transformed into\nillusion, and illusion continues the material existence. Therefore, lust is the\ngreatest enemy of the living entity, and it is lust only which induces the pure\nliving entity to remain entangled in the material world. Wrath is the\nmanifestation of the mode of ignorance; these modes exhibit themselves as wrath\nand other corollaries. If, therefore, the modes of passion, instead of being\ndegraded into the modes of ignorance, are elevated to the modes of goodness by\nthe prescribed method of Iiving and acting, then one can be saved from the\ndegradation of wrath by spiritual attachment.\n\n\nThe Supreme Personality of Godhead expanded Himself into many for His\never-increasing spiritual bliss, and the living entities are parts and parcels\nof this spiritual bliss. They also have partial independence, but by misuse of\ntheir independence, when the service attitude is transformed into the propensity\nfor sense enjoyment, they come under the sway of lust. This material creation is\ncreated by the Lord to give a facility to the conditioned souls to fulfill these\nlustful propensities, and when they are completely baffled by prolonged lustful\nactivities, the living entities begin to inquire about their real position.\n\n\nThis inquiry is the beginning of the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btras, wherein it is said, ath\u0101to\nbrahma-jij\u00f1\u0101s\u0101: one should inquire into the Supreme. And the Supreme is defined\nin \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam as janm\u0101dyasya yato \u2019nvay\u0101d itarata\u015b ca, or, \u201cThe origin of\neverything is the Supreme Brahman.\u201d Therefore, the origin of lust is also in the\nSupreme. If, therefore, lust is transformed into love for the Supreme, or\ntransformed into K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness\u2014or, in other words, desiring everything for\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2014then both lust and wrath can be spiritualized. Hanum\u0101n, the great servitor\nof Lord Rama, engaged his wrath upon his enemies for the satisfaction of the\nLord. Therefore, lust and wrath, when they are employed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness,\nbecome our friends instead of our enemies.\n\n\n3.38\n\n\ndh\u016bmen\u0101vriyate vahnir\n\n\nyath\u0101dar\u015bo malena ca\n\n\nyatholben\u0101v\u1e5bto garbhas\n\n\ntath\u0101 tenedam \u0101v\u1e5btam\n\n\ndh\u016bmena\u2014by smoke; \u0101vriyate\u2014covered; vahni\u1e25\u2014fire; yath\u0101\u2014just as; \u0101dar\u015ba\u1e25\u2014mirror;\nmalena\u2014by dust; ca\u2014also; yath\u0101\u2014just as; ulbena\u2014by the womb; \u0101v\u1e5bta\u1e25\u2014is covered;\ngarbha\u1e25\u2014embryo; tath\u0101\u2014so; tena\u2014by that lust; idam\u2014this; \u0101v\u1e5btam\u2014is covered.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nAs fire is covered by smoke, as a mirror is covered by dust, or as the embryo is\ncovered by the womb, similarly, the living entity is covered by different\ndegrees of this lust.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThere are three degrees of covering of the living entity by which his pure\nconsciousness is obscured. This covering is but lust under different\nmanifestations like smoke in the fire, dust on the mirror, and the womb about\nthe embryo. When lust is compared to smoke, it is understood that the fire of\nthe living spark can be a little perceived. In other words, when the living\nentity exhibits his K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness slightly, he may be likened to the fire\ncovered by smoke. Although fire is necessary where there is smoke, there is no\novert manifestation of fire in the early stage. This stage is like the beginning\nof K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. The dust on the mirror refers to a cleansing process of\nthe mirror of the mind by so many spiritual methods. The best process is to\nchant the holy names of the Lord. The embryo covered by the womb is an analogy\nillustrating a helpless position, for the child in the womb is so helpless that\nhe cannot even move. This stage of living condition can be compared to that of\nthe trees. The trees are also living entities, but they have been put in such a\ncondition of life by such a great exhibition of lust that they are almost void\nof all consciousness. The covered mirror is compared to the birds and beasts,\nand the smoke covered fire is compared to the human being. In the form of a\nhuman being, the living entity may revive a little K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, and, if\nhe makes further development, the fire of spiritual life can be kindled in the\nhuman form of life. By careful handling of the smoke in the fire, the fire can\nbe made to blaze. Therefore the human form of life is a chance for the living\nentity to escape the entanglement of material existence. In the human form of\nlife, one can conquer the enemy, lust, by cultivation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness\nunder able guidance.\n\n\n3.39\n\n\n\u0101v\u1e5bta\u1e41 j\u00f1\u0101nam etena\n\n\nj\u00f1\u0101nino nitya-vairi\u1e47\u0101\n\n\nk\u0101ma-r\u016bpe\u1e47a kaunteya\n\n\ndu\u1e63p\u016bre\u1e47\u0101nalena ca\n\n\n\u0101v\u1e5btam\u2014covered; j\u00f1\u0101nam\u2014pure consciousness; etena\u2014by this; j\u00f1\u0101nina\u1e25\u2014of the\nknower; nitya-vairi\u1e47\u0101\u2014eternal enemy; k\u0101ma-r\u016bpe\u1e47a\u2014in the form of lust; kaunteya\u2014O\nson of Kunt\u012b; du\u1e63p\u016bre\u1e47a\u2014never to be satisfied; analena\u2014by the fire; ca\u2014also.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThus, a man\u2019s pure consciousness is covered by his eternal enemy in the form of\nlust, which is never satisfied and which burns like fire.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nIt is said in the Manu-sm\u1e5bti that lust cannot be satisfied by any amount of\nsense enjoyment, just as fire is never extinguished by a constant supply of\nfuel. In the material world, the center of all activities is sex, and thus this\nmaterial world is called maithu\u1e47ya-\u0101g\u0101ra, or the shackles of sex life. In the\nordinary prison house, criminals are kept within bars; similarly, the criminals\nwho are disobedient to the laws of the Lord are shackled by sex life.\nAdvancement of material civilization on the basis of sense gratification means\nincreasing the duration of the material existence of a living entity. Therefore,\nthis lust is the symbol of ignorance by which the living entity is kept within\nthe material world. While one enjoys sense gratification, it may be that there\nis some feeling of happiness, but actually that so-called feeling of happiness\nis the ultimate enemy of the sense enjoyer.\n\n\n3.40\n\n\nindriy\u0101\u1e47i mano buddhir\n\n\nasy\u0101dhi\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101nam ucyate\n\n\netair vimohayaty e\u1e63a\n\n\nj\u00f1\u0101nam \u0101v\u1e5btya dehinam\n\n\nindriy\u0101\u1e47i\u2014the senses; mana\u1e25\u2014the mind; buddhi\u1e25\u2014the intelligence; asya\u2014of the\nlust; adhi\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101nam\u2014sitting place; ucyate\u2014called; etai\u1e25\u2014by all these;\nvimohayati\u2014bewilders; e\u1e63a\u1e25\u2014of this; j\u00f1\u0101nam\u2014knowledge; \u0101v\u1e5btya\u2014covering;\ndehinam\u2014the embodied.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThe senses, the mind and the intelligence are the sitting places of this lust,\nwhich veils the real knowledge of the living entity and bewilders him.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe enemy has captured different strategic positions in the body of the\nconditioned soul, and therefore Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is giving hints of those places, so\nthat one who wants to conquer the enemy may know where he can be found. Mind is\nthe center of all the activities of the senses, and thus the mind is the\nreservoir of all ideas of sense gratification; and, as a result, the mind and\nthe senses become the repositories of lust. Next, the intelligence department\nbecomes the capital of such lustful propensities. Intelligence is the immediate\nnext-door neighbor of the spirit soul. Lusty intelligence influences the spirit\nsoul to acquire the false ego and identify itself with matter, and thus with the\nmind and senses. The spirit soul becomes addicted to enjoying the material\nsenses and mistakes this as true happiness. This false identification of the\nspirit soul is very nicely explained in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam:\n\n\nyasy\u0101tma-buddhi\u1e25 ku\u1e47\u0101pe tri-dh\u0101tuke sva-dh\u012b\u1e25 kalatr\u0101di\u1e63u bhauma idyadh\u012b\u1e25\nyat-t\u012brtha-buddhi\u1e25 salite na karhicij jane\u1e63v abhij\u00f1e\u1e63u sa eva gokhara\u1e25.\n\n\n\u201cA human being who identifies this body made of three elements with his self,\nwho considers the by-products of the body to be his kinsmen, who considers the\nland of birth as worshipable, and who goes to the place of pilgrimage simply to\ntake a bath rather than meet men of transcendental knowledge there, is to be\nconsidered as an ass or a cow.\u201d\n\n\n3.41\n\n\ntasm\u0101t tvam indriy\u0101\u1e47y \u0101dau\n\n\nniyamya bharatar\u1e63abha\n\n\np\u0101pm\u0101na\u1e41 prajahi hy ena\u1e41\n\n\nj\u00f1\u0101na-vij\u00f1\u0101na-n\u0101\u015banam\n\n\ntasm\u0101t\u2014therefore; tvam\u2014you; indriy\u0101\u1e47i\u2014senses; \u0101dau\u2014in the beginning; niyamya\u2014by\nregulating; bharatar\u1e63abha\u2014O chief amongst the descendants of Bharata;\np\u0101pm\u0101nam\u2014the great symbol of sin; prajahi\u2014curb; hi\u2014certainly; enam\u2014this;\nj\u00f1\u0101na\u2014knowledge; vij\u00f1\u0101na\u2014scientific knowledge of the pure soul;\nn\u0101\u015banam\u2014destroyer.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nTherefore, O Arjuna, best of the Bh\u0101ratas, in the very beginning curb this great\nsymbol of sin [lust] by regulating the senses, and slay this destroyer of\nknowledge and self-realization.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe Lord advised Arjuna to regulate the senses from the very beginning so that\nhe could curb the greatest sinful enemy, lust, which destroys the urge for\nself-realization, and specifically, knowledge of the self. J\u00f1\u0101nam refers to\nknowledge of self as distinguished from non-self, or, in other words, knowledge\nthat the spirit soul is not the body. Vij\u00f1\u0101nam refers to specific knowledge of\nthe spirit soul and knowledge of one\u2019s constitutional position and his\nrelationship to the Supreme Soul. It is explained thus in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam:\nj\u00f1\u0101na\u1e41 parama-guhya\u1e41 me yad-vij\u00f1\u0101na-samanvitam / sarahasya\u1e41 tad-a\u1e45ga\u1e41 ca g\u1e5bh\u0101na\ngadita\u1e41 may\u0101: \u201cThe knowledge of the self and the Supreme Self is very\nconfidential and mysterious, being veiled by m\u0101y\u0101, but such knowledge and\nspecific realization can be understood if it is explained by the Lord Himself.\u201d\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 gives us that knowledge, specifically knowledge of the self. The\nliving entities are parts and parcels of the Lord, and therefore they are simply\nmeant to serve the Lord. This consciousness is called K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. So,\nfrom the very beginning of life one has to learn this K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, and\nthereby one may become fully K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious and act accordingly.\n\n\nLust is only the perverted reflection of the love of God which is natural for\nevery living entity. But if one is educated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness from the very\nbeginning, that natural love of God cannot deteriorate into lust. When love of\nGod deteriorates into lust, it is very difficult to return to the normal\ncondition. Nonetheless, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is so powerful that even a late\nbeginner can become a lover of God by following the regulative principles of\ndevotional service. So, from any stage of life, or from the time of\nunderstanding its urgency, one can begin regulating the senses in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness, devotional service of the Lord, and turn the lust into love of\nGodhead\u2014the highest perfectional stage of human life.\n\n\n3.42\n\n\nindriy\u0101\u1e47i par\u0101\u1e47y \u0101hur\n\n\nindriyebhya\u1e25 para\u1e41 mana\u1e25\n\n\nmanasas tu par\u0101 buddhir\n\n\nyo buddhe\u1e25 paratas tu sa\u1e25\n\n\nindriy\u0101\u1e47\u012b\u2014senses; par\u0101\u1e47i\u2014superior; \u0101hu\u1e25\u2014is said; indriyebhya\u1e25\u2014more than the\nsenses; param\u2014superior; mana\u1e25\u2014the mind; manasa\u1e25\u2014more than the mind; tu\u2014also;\npar\u0101\u2014superior; buddhi\u1e25\u2014intelligence; ya\u1e25\u2014one which; buddhe\u1e25\u2014more than the\nintelligence; parata\u1e25\u2014superior; tu\u2014but; sa\u1e25\u2014he.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThe working senses are superior to dull matter; mind is higher than the senses;\nintelligence is still higher than the mind; and he [the soul] is even higher\nthan the intelligence.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe senses are different outlets for the activities of lust. Lust is reserved\nwithin the body, but it is given vent through the senses. Therefore, the senses\nare superior to the body as a whole. These outlets are not in use when there is\nsuperior consciousness, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. In K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness the soul\nmakes direct connection with the Supreme Personality of Godhead; therefore the\nbodily functions, as described here, ultimately end in the Supreme Soul. Bodily\naction means the functions of the senses, and stopping the senses means stopping\nall bodily actions. But since the mind is active, then, even though the body may\nbe silent and at rest, the mind will act\u2014as it does during dreaming. But, above\nthe mind there is the determination of the intelligence, and above the\nintelligence is the soul proper. If, therefore, the soul is directly engaged\nwith the Supreme, naturally all other subordinates, namely, the intelligence,\nmind and the senses, will be automatically engaged. In the Ka\u1e6dha Upani\u1e63ad there\nis a passage in which it is said that the objects of sense gratification are\nsuperior to the senses, and mind is superior to the sense objects. If,\ntherefore, the mind is directly engaged in the service of the Lord constantly,\nthen there is no chance of the senses becoming engaged in other ways. This\nmental attitude has already been explained. If the mind is engaged in the\ntranscendental service of the Lord, there is no chance of its being engaged in\nthe lower propensities. In the Ka\u1e6dha Upani\u1e63ad the soul has been described as\nmah\u0101n, the great. Therefore the soul is above all\u2014namely, the sense objects, the\nsenses, the mind and the intelligence. Therefore, directly understanding the\nconstitutional position of the soul is the solution of the whole problem.\n\n\nWith intelligence one has to seek out the constitutional position of the soul\nand then engage the mind always in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. That solves the whole\nproblem. A neophyte spiritualist is generally advised to keep aloof from the\nobjects of senses. One has to strengthen the mind by use of intelligence. If by\nintelligence one engages one\u2019s mind in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, by complete\nsurrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, then, automatically, the mind\nbecomes stronger, and even though the senses are very strong, like serpents,\nthey will be no more effective than serpents with broken fangs. But even though\nthe soul is the master of intelligence and mind, and the senses also, still,\nunless it is strengthened by association with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness,\nthere is every chance of falling down due to the agitated mind.\n\n\n3.43\n\n\neva\u1e41 buddhe\u1e25 para\u1e41 buddhv\u0101\n\n\nsa\u1e41stabhy\u0101tm\u0101nam \u0101tman\u0101\n\n\njahi \u015batru\u1e41 mah\u0101-b\u0101ho\n\n\nk\u0101ma-r\u016bpa\u1e41 dur\u0101sadam\n\n\nevam\u2014thus; buddhe\u1e25\u2014of intelligence; param\u2014superior; buddhv\u0101\u2014so knowing;\nsa\u1e41stabhya\u2014by steadying; \u0101tm\u0101nam\u2014the mind; \u0101tman\u0101\u2014by deliberate intelligence;\njahi\u2014conquer; \u015batrum\u2014the enemy; mah\u0101-b\u0101ho\u2014O mighty-armed one; k\u0101ma-r\u016bpam\u2014the\nform of lust; dur\u0101sadam\u2014formidable.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThus knowing oneself to be transcendental to material senses, mind and\nintelligence, one should control the lower self by the higher self and thus\u2014by\nspiritual strength\u2014conquer this insatiable enemy known as lust.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThis Third Chapter of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is conclusively directive to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness by knowing oneself as the eternal servitor of the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead, without considering impersonal voidness as the ultimate\nend. In the material existence of life, one is certainly influenced by\npropensities for lust and desire for dominating the resources of material\nnature. Desire for overlording and sense gratification are the greatest enemies\nof the conditioned soul; but by the strength of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, one can\ncontrol the material senses, the mind and the intelligence. One may not give up\nwork and prescribed duties all of a sudden; but by gradually developing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness, one can be situated in a transcendental position without being\ninfluenced by the material senses and the mind\u2014by steady intelligence directed\ntoward one\u2019s pure identity. This is the sum total of this chapter. In the\nimmature stage of material existence, philosophical speculations and artificial\nattempts to control the senses by the so-called practice of yogic postures can\nnever help a man toward spiritual life. He must be trained in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness by higher intelligence.",

PURPORT  The Supreme Personality of Godhead \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has very elaborately described the\nconstitution of the soul in the previous chapter, with a view to deliver His\nintimate friend Arjuna from the ocean of material grief. And the path of\nrealization has been recommended: buddhi-yoga, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Sometimes\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is misunderstood to be inertia, and one with such a\nmisunderstanding often withdraws to a secluded place to become fully K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconscious by chanting the holy name of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. But without being trained in\nthe philosophy of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, it is not advisable to chant the holy\nname of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in a secluded place where one may acquire only cheap adoration\nfrom the innocent public. Arjuna also thought of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness or\nbuddhi-yoga, or intelligence in spiritual advancement of knowledge, as something\nlike retirement from active life and the practice of penance and austerity at a\nsecluded place. In other words, he wanted to skillfully avoid the fighting by\nusing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness as an excuse. But as a sincere student, he placed the\nmatter before his master and questioned K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as to his best course of action.\nIn answer, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a elaborately explained karma-yoga, or work in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness, in this Third Chapter.",

A more organized outline of the path\nwould be necessary for action and understanding. Arjuna, therefore, wanted to\nclear up these apparently confusing matters so that any common man could accept\nthem without misinterpretation. Although K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a had no intention of confusing\nArjuna by any jugglery of words, Arjuna could not follow the process of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness\u2014either by inertia or active service. In other words, by his\nquestions he is clearing the path of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness for all students who\nseriously want to understand the mystery of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.",

TRANSLATION  The Blessed Lord said: O sinless Arjuna, I have already explained that there are\ntwo classes of men who realize the Self. Some are inclined to understand Him by\nempirical, philosophical speculation, and others are inclined to know Him by\ndevotional work.  PURPORT  In the Second Chapter, verse 39, the Lord explained two kinds of\nprocedures\u2014namely s\u0101\u1e45khya-yoga and karma-yoga, or buddhi-yoga. In this verse,\nthe Lord explains the same more clearly. S\u0101\u1e45khya-yoga, or the analytical study\nof the nature of spirit and matter, is the subject matter for persons who are\ninclined to speculate and understand things by experimental knowledge and\nphilosophy. The other class of men work in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, as it is\nexplained in the 61st verse of the Second Chapter. The Lord has explained, also\nin the 39th verse, that by working by the principles of buddhi-yoga, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness, one can be relieved from the bonds of action; and, furthermore,\nthere is no flaw in the process. The same principle is more clearly explained in\nthe 61st verse\u2014that this buddhi-yoga is to depend entirely on the Supreme (or\nmore specifically, on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a), and in this way all the senses can be brought\nunder control very easily. Therefore, both the yogas are interdependant, as\nreligion and philosophy. Religion without philosophy is sentiment, or sometimes\nfanaticism, while philosophy without religion is mental speculation. The\nultimate goal is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, because the philosophers who are also sincerely\nsearching after the Absolute Truth come in the end to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. This\nis also stated in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. The whole process is to understand the real\nposition of the self in relation to the Superself. The indirect process is\nphilosophical speculation, by which, gradually, one may come to the point of\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness; and the other process is directly connecting with\neverything in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Of these two, the path of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness\nis better because it does not depend on purifying the senses by a philosophical\nprocess. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is itself the purifying process, and by the direct\nmethod of devotional service it is simultaneously easy and sublime.",

Without purification, one cannot attain success by abruptly\nadopting the fourth order of life (sanny\u0101sa). According to the empirical\nphilosophers, simply by adopting sanny\u0101sa, or retiring from fruitive activities,\none at once becomes as good as N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. But Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a does not approve this\nprinciple. Without purification of heart, sanny\u0101sa is simply a disturbance to\nthe social order.

TRANSLATION  All men are forced to act helplessly according to the impulses born of the modes\nof material nature; therefore no one can refrain from doing something, not even\nfor a moment.  PURPORT  It is not a question of embodied life, but it is the nature of the soul to be\nalways active. Without the presence of the spirit soul, the material body cannot\nmove. The body is only a dead vehicle to be worked by the spirit soul, which is\nalways active and cannot stop even for a moment. As such, the spirit soul has to\nbe engaged in the good work of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, otherwise it will be engaged\nin occupations dictated by illusory energy. In contact with material energy, the\nspirit soul acquires material modes, and to purify the soul from such affinities\nit is necessary to engage in the prescribed duties enjoined in the \u015b\u0101stras. But\nif the soul is engaged in his natural function of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, whatever\nhe is able to do is good for him. The \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam affirms this:  tyaktv\u0101 sva-dharma\u1e41 cara\u1e47\u0101mbuja\u1e41 harer bhajann apakvo \u2019tha patet tato yadi yatra\nkva v\u0101bhadram abh\u016bd amu\u1e63ya ki\u1e41 ko v\u0101rtha \u0101pto \u2019bhajat\u0101\u1e41 sva-dharmata\u1e25.  \u201cIf someone takes to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, even though he may not follow the\nprescribed duties in the \u015b\u0101stras nor execute the devotional service properly,\nand even though he may fall down from the standard, there is no loss or evil for\nhim. But if he carries out all the injunctions for purification in the \u015b\u0101stras,\nwhat does it avail him if he is not K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious?\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 1.5.17) So the\npurificatory process is necessary for reaching this point of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness. Therefore, sanny\u0101sa, or any purificatory process, is to help\nreach the ultimate goal of becoming K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, without which everything is\nconsidered a failure.",

Arjuna was a householder and a military\ngeneral, and therefore it was better for him to remain as such and perform his\nreligious duties as prescribed for the householder k\u1e63atriya. Such activities\ngradually cleanse the heart of a mundane man and free him from material\ncontamination. So-called renunciation for the purpose of maintenance is never\napproved by the Lord, nor by any religious scripture. After all, one has to\nmaintain one\u2019s body and soul together by some work. Work should not be given up\ncapriciously, without purification of materialistic propensities. Anyone who is\nin the material world is certainly possessed of the impure propensity for\nlording it over material nature, or, in other words, for sense gratification.\nSuch polluted propensities have to be cleared. Without doing so, through\nprescribed duties, one should never attempt to become a so-called\ntranscendentalist, renouncing work and living at the cost of others.",

Therefore, O son of Kunt\u012b, perform your prescribed\nduties for His satisfaction, and in that way you will always remain unattached\nand free from bondage.  PURPORT  Since one has to work even for the simple maintenance of the body, the\nprescribed duties for a particular social position and quality are so made that\nthat purpose can be fulfilled. Yaj\u00f1a means Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, or sacrificial\nperformances. All sacrificial performances also are meant for the satisfaction\nof Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. The Vedas enjoin: yaj\u00f1o vai vi\u1e63\u1e47u\u1e25. In other words, the same\npurpose is served whether one performs prescribed yaj\u00f1as or directly serves Lord\nVi\u1e63\u1e47u. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is therefore performance of yaj\u00f1a as it is prescribed\nin this verse. The var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama institution also aims at this for satisfying Lord\nVi\u1e63\u1e47u. \u201cVar\u1e47\u0101\u015bram\u0101c\u0101ra-vat\u0101 puru\u1e63e\u1e47a para\u1e25 pum\u0101n/vi\u1e63\u1e47ur \u0101r\u0101dhyate\u2026\u201d (Vi\u1e63\u1e47u\nPur\u0101\u1e47a 3.8.8) Therefore one has to work for the satisfaction of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Any other\nwork done in this material world wilI be a cause of bondage, for both good and\nevil work have their reactions, and any reaction binds the performer. Therefore,\none has to work in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness to satisfy K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (or Vi\u1e63\u1e47u); and while\nperforming such activities one is in a liberated stage. This is the great art of\ndoing work, and in the beginning this process requires very expert guidance. One\nshould therefore act very diligently, under the expert guidance of a devotee of\nLord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or under the direct instruction of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself (under whom\nArjuna had the opportunity to work). Nothing should be performed for sense\ngratification, but everything should be done for the satisfaction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This\npractice will not only save one from the reaction of work, but will also\ngradually elevate one to transcendental loving service of the Lord, which alone\ncan raise one to the kingdom of God.",

All living entities\nwithin the material creation are conditioned by material nature because of their\nforgetfulness of their relationship to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead. The Vedic principles are to help us understand this eternal relation as\nit is stated in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101: vedai\u015b ca sarvair aham eva vedya\u1e25. The Lord\nsays that the purpose of the Vedas is to understand Him. In the Vedic hymns it\nis said: pati\u1e41 vi\u015bvasy\u0101tme\u015bvaram. Therefore, the Lord of the living entities is\nthe Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. In the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam also \u015ar\u012bla\n\u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b describes the Lord as pati in so many ways:  \u015briya\u1e25-patir yaj\u00f1a-pati\u1e25 praj\u0101-patir dhiy\u0101\u1e41 patir loka-patir dhar\u0101-pati\u1e25 patir\ngati\u015b c\u0101ndhaka-v\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47i-s\u0101tvat\u0101\u1e41 pras\u012bdat\u0101\u1e41 me bhagav\u0101n sat\u0101\u1e41 pati\u1e25  (Bh\u0101g. 2.4.20)  The praj\u0101-pati is Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, and He is the Lord of all living creatures, all\nworlds, and all beauties, and the protector of everyone. The Lord created this\nmaterial world for the conditioned souls to learn how to perform yaj\u00f1as\n(sacrifice) for the satisfaction of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, so that while in the material world\nthey can live very comfortably without anxiety. Then after finishing the present\nmaterial body, they can enter into the kingdom of God. That is the whole program\nfor the conditioned soul. By performance of yaj\u00f1a, the conditioned souls\ngradually become K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious and become godly in all respects. In this age\nof Kali, the sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-yaj\u00f1a (the chanting of the names of God) is recommended\nby the Vedic scriptures, and this transcendental system was introduced by Lord\nCaitanya for the deliverance of all men in this age. Sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-yaj\u00f1a and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness go well together. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in His devotional form (as Lord\nCaitanya) is mentioned in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam as follows, with special\nreference to the sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-yaj\u00f1a:  k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-var\u1e47a\u1e41 tvi\u1e63\u0101k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47\u0101\u1e41 s\u0101\u1e45gop\u0101\u1e45g\u0101stra-p\u0101r\u1e63adam yaj\u00f1ai\u1e25 sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-pr\u0101yair\nyajanti hi su-medhasa\u1e25  \u201cIn this age of Kali, people who are endowed with sufficient intelligence will\nworship the Lord, who is accompanied by His associates, by performance of\nsa\u1e45k\u012brtana-yaj\u00f1a.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 11.5.29) Other yaj\u00f1as prescribed in the Vedic\nliteratures are not easy to perform in this age of Kali, but the\nsa\u1e45k\u012brtana-yaj\u00f1a is easy and sublime for all purposes.",

The supply of\nair, light, water and all other benedictions for maintaining the body and soul\nof every living entity are entrusted to the demigods, who are innumerable\nassistants in different parts of the body of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\nTheir pleasures and displeasures are dependant on the performance of yaj\u00f1as by\nthe human being. Some of the yaj\u00f1as are meant to satisfy particular demigods;\nbut even in so doing, Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is worshiped in all yaj\u00f1as as the chief\nbeneficiary. It is stated also in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself is the\nbeneficiary of all kinds of yaj\u00f1as: bhokt\u0101ra\u1e41 yaj\u00f1a-tapas\u0101m. Therefore, ultimate\nsatisfaction of the yaj\u00f1apati is the chief purpose of all yaj\u00f1as. When these\nyaj\u00f1as are perfectly performed, naturally the demigods in charge of the\ndifferent departments of supply are pleased, and there is no scarcity in the\nsupply of natural products.  Performance of yaj\u00f1as has many side benefits, ultimately leading to liberation\nfrom the material bondage. By performance of yaj\u00f1as, all activities become\npurified, as it is stated in the Vedas:  \u0101h\u0101ra-\u015buddhau sattva-\u015buddhi\u1e25 sattva-\u015buddhau dhruv\u0101 sm\u1e5bti\u1e25 sm\u1e5bti-lambhe\nsarva-granth\u012bn\u0101\u1e41 vipra-mok\u1e63a\u1e25  As it will be explained in the following verse, by performance of yaj\u00f1a, one\u2019s\neatables become sanctified, and by eating sanctified foodstuffs, one\u2019s very\nexistence becomes purified; by the purification of existence, finer tissues in\nthe memory become sanctified, and when memory is sanctified, one can think of\nthe path of liberation, and all these combined together lead to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness, the great necessity of present-day society.",

TRANSLATION  In charge of the various necessities of life, the demigods, being satisfied by\nthe performance of yaj\u00f1a [sacrifice], supply all necessities to man. But he who\nenjoys these gifts, without offering them to the demigods in return, is\ncertainly a thief.  PURPORT  The demigods are authorized supplying agents on behalf of the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Therefore, they must be satisfied by the\nperformance of prescribed yaj\u00f1as. In the Vedas, there are different kinds of\nyaj\u00f1as prescribed for different kinds of demigods, but all are ultimately\noffered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. For one who cannot understand\nwhat the Personality of Godhead is, sacrifice to the demigods is recommended.\nAccording to the different material qualities of the persons concerned,\ndifferent types of yaj\u00f1as are recommended in the Vedas. Worship of different\ndemigods is also on the same basis\u2014namely, according to different qualities. For\nexample, the meat-eaters are recommended to worship the goddess K\u0101l\u012b, the\nghastly form of material nature, and before the goddess the sacrifice of animals\nis recommended. But for those who are in the mode of goodness, the\ntranscendental worship of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is recommended. But ultimately, all yaj\u00f1as are\nmeant for gradual promotion to the transcendental position. For ordinary men, at\nleast five yaj\u00f1as, known as pa\u00f1ca-mah\u0101yaj\u00f1a, are necessary.  One should know, however, that all the necessities of life that the human\nsociety requires are supplied by the demigod agents of the Lord. No one can\nmanufacture anything. Take, for example, all the eatables of human society.\nThese eatables include grains, fruits, vegetables, milk, sugar, etc., for the\npersons in the mode of goodness, and also eatables for the nonvegetarians, like\nmeats, etc., none of which can be manufactured by men. Then again, take for\nexample heat, light, water, air, etc., which are also necessities of life\u2014none\nof them can be manufactured by the human society. Without the Supreme Lord,\nthere can be no profuse sunlight, moonlight, rainfall, breeze, etc., without\nwhich no one can live. Obviously, our life is dependant on supplies from the\nLord. Even for our manufacturing enterprises, we require so many raw materials\nlike metal, sulphur, mercury, manganese, and so many essentials\u2014all of which are\nsupplied by the agents of the Lord, with the purpose that we should make proper\nuse of them to keep ourselves fit and healthy for the purpose of\nself-realization, leading to the ultimate goal of life, namely, liberation from\nthe material struggle for existence. This aim of life is attained by performance\nof yaj\u00f1as. If we forget the purpose of human life and simply take supplies from\nthe agents of the Lord for sense gratification and become more and more\nentangled in material existence, which is not the purpose of creation, certainly\nwe become thieves, and therefore we are punished by the laws of material nature.\nA society of thieves can never be happy because they have no aim in life. The\ngross materialist thieves have no ultimate goal of life. They are simply\ndirected to sense gratification; nor do they have knowledge of how to perform\nyaj\u00f1as. Lord Caitanya, however, inaugurated the easiest performance of yaj\u00f1a,\nnamely the sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-yaj\u00f1a, which can be performed by anyone in the world who\naccepts the principles of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.",

When Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is worshiped, the demigods, who are different limbs\nof the Lord, are also automatically worshiped; therefore there is no separate\nneed to worship the demigods. For this reason, the devotees of the Lord, who are\nin K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, offer food to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and then eat\u2014a process which\nnourishes the body spiritually. By such action not only are past sinful\nreactions in the body vanquished, but the body becomes immunized to all\ncontamination of material nature. When there is an epidemic disease, an\nantiseptic vaccine protects a person from the attack of such an epidemic.\nSimilarly, food offered to Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u and then taken by us makes us sufficiently\nresistant to material affection, and one who is accustomed to this practice is\ncalled a devotee of the Lord. Therefore, a person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, who\neats only food offered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, can counteract all reactions of past material\ninfections, which are impediments to the progress of self-realization. On the\nother hand, one who does not do so continues to increase the volume of sinful\naction, and this prepares the next body to resemble hogs and dogs, to suffer the\nresultant reactions of all sins. The material world is full of contaminations,\nand one who is immunized by accepting pras\u0101dam of the Lord (food offered to\nVi\u1e63\u1e47u) is saved from the attack, whereas one who does not do so becomes\nsubjected to contamination.  Food grains or vegetables are factually eatables. The human being eats different\nkinds of food grains, vegetables, fruits, etc., and the animals eat the refuse\nof the food grains and vegetables, grass, plants, etc. Human beings who are\naccustomed to eating meat and flesh must also depend on the production of\nvegetation in order to eat the animals. Therefore, ultimately, we have to depend\non the production of the field and not on the production of big factories. The\nfield production is due to sufficient rain from the sky, and such rains are\ncontrolled by demigods like Indra, sun, moon, etc., and they are all servants of\nthe Lord. The Lord can be satisfied by sacrifices; therefore, one who cannot\nperform them will find himself in scarcity\u2014that is the law of nature. Yaj\u00f1a,\nspecifically the sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-yaj\u00f1a prescribed for this age, must therefore be\nperformed to save us at least from scarcity of food supply.",

TRANSLATION  Regulated activities are prescribed in the Vedas, and the Vedas are directly\nmanifested from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Consequently the\nall-pervading Transcendence is eternally situated in acts of sacrifice.  PURPORT  Yaj\u00f1\u0101rtha karma, or the necessity of work for the satisfaction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a only, is\nmore expressly stated in this verse. If we have to work for the satisfaction of\nthe yaj\u00f1a-puru\u1e63a, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, then we must find out the direction of work in Brahman,\nor the transcendental Vedas. The Vedas are therefore codes of working\ndirections. Anything performed without the direction of the Vedas is called\nvikarma, or unauthorized or sinful work. Therefore, one should always take\ndirection from the Vedas to be saved from the reaction of work. As one has to\nwork in ordinary life by the direction of the state, similarly, one has to work\nunder direction of the supreme state of the Lord. Such directions in the Vedas\nare directly manifested from the breathing of the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead. It is said: asya mahato bh\u016btasya na\u015bvasitam etad yad \u1e5bg-vedo\nyajur-veda\u1e25 s\u0101ma-vedo \u2019tharv\u0101\u1e45 girasa\u1e25. \u201cThe four Vedas\u2014namely the \u1e5ag-veda,\nYajur-veda, S\u0101ma-veda and Atharva-veda\u2014are all emanations from the breathing of\nthe great Personality of Godhead.\u201d The Lord, being omnipotent, can speak by\nbreathing air, as it is confirmed in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101, for the Lord has the\nomnipotence to perform through each of His senses the actions of all other\nsenses. In other words, the Lord can speak through His breathing, and He can\nimpregnate by His eyes. In fact, it is said that He glanced over material nature\nand thus fathered all living entities. After creating or impregnating the\nconditioned souls into the womb of material nature, He gave His directions in\nthe Vedic wisdom as to how such conditioned souls can return home, back to\nGodhead. We should always remember that the conditioned souls in material nature\nare all eager for material enjoyment. But the Vedic directions are so made that\none can satisfy one\u2019s perverted desires, then return to Godhead, having finished\nhis so-called enjoyment. It is a chance for the conditioned souls to attain\nliberation; therefore the conditioned souls must try to follow the process of\nyaj\u00f1a by becoming K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious. Even those who cannot follow the Vedic\ninjunctions may adopt the principles of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, and that will take\nthe place of performance of Vedic yaj\u00f1as, or karmas.",

TRANSLATION  My dear Arjuna, a man who does not follow this prescribed Vedic system of\nsacrifice certainly leads a life of sin, for a person delighting only in the\nsenses lives in vain.  PURPORT  The mammonist philosophy of work very hard and enjoy sense gratification is\ncondemned herein by the Lord. Therefore, for those who want to enjoy this\nmaterial world, the above-mentioned cycle of performing yaj\u00f1as is absolutely\nnecessary. One who does not follow such regulations is living a very risky life,\nbeing condemned more and more. By nature\u2019s law, this human form of life is\nspecifically meant for self-realization, in either of the three ways\u2014namely\nkarma-yoga, j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga, or bhakti-yoga. There is no necessity of rigidly\nfollowing the performances of the prescribed yaj\u00f1as for the transcendentalists\nwho are above vice and virtue; but those who are engaged in sense gratification\nrequire purification by the above-mentioned cycle of yaj\u00f1a performances. There\nare different kinds of activities. Those who are not K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious are\ncertainly engaged in sensory consciousness; therefore they need to execute pious\nwork. The yaj\u00f1a system is planned in such a way that sensory conscious persons\nmay satisfy their desires without becoming entangled in the reaction of\nsense-gratificatory work. The prosperity of the world depends not on our own\nefforts but on the background arrangement of the Supreme Lord, directly carried\nout by the demigods. Therefore, the yaj\u00f1as are directly aimed at the particular\ndemigod mentioned in the Vedas. Indirectly, it is the practice of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness, because when one masters the performance of yaj\u00f1as, one is sure\nto become K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious. But if by performing yaj\u00f1as one does not become K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconscious, such principles are counted as only moral codes. One should not,\ntherefore, limit his progress only to the point of moral codes, but should\ntranscend them, to attain K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.",

I\nwould also be the cause of creating unwanted population, and I would thereby\ndestroy the peace of all sentient beings.  PURPORT  Var\u1e47a-sa\u1e45kara is unwanted population which disturbs the peace of the general\nsociety. In order to check this social disturbance, there are prescribed rules\nand regulations by which the population can automatically become peaceful and\norganized for spiritual progress in life. When Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a descends, naturally He\ndeals with such rules and regulations in order to maintain the prestige and\nnecessity of such important performances. The Lord is the father of all living\nentities, and if the living entities are misguided, indirectly the\nresponsibility goes to the Lord. Therefore, whenever there is general disregard\nof regulative principles, the Lord Himself descends and corrects the society. We\nshould, however, note carefully that although we have to follow in the footsteps\nof the Lord, we still have to remember that we cannot imitate Him. Following and\nimitating are not on the same level. We cannot imitate the Lord by lifting\nGovardhana Hill, as the Lord did in His childhood. It is impossible for any\nhuman being. We have to follow His instructions, but we may not imitate Him at\nany time. The \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam affirms:  naitat sam\u0101carej j\u0101tu manas\u0101pi hy an\u012b\u015bvara\u1e25 vina\u015byaty \u0101caran mau\u1e0dhy\u0101d yath\u0101\n\u2019rudro \u2019bdhija\u1e41 vi\u1e63am  \u012b\u015bvar\u0101\u1e47\u0101\u1e41 vaca\u1e25 satya\u1e41 tathaiv\u0101carita\u1e41 kvacit te\u1e63\u0101\u1e41 yat sva-vaco yukta\u1e41\nbuddhim\u0101\u1e41s tat sam\u0101caret  \u201cOne should simply follow the instructions of the Lord and His empowered\nservants. Their instructions are all good for us, and any intelligent person\nwill perform them as instructed. However, one should guard against trying to\nimitate their actions. One should not try to drink the ocean of poison in\nimitation of Lord \u015aiva.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 10.33.30)  We should always consider the position of the \u012b\u015bvaras, or those who can actually\ncontrol the movements of the sun and moon, as superior. Without such power, one\ncannot imitate the \u012b\u015bvaras, who are superpowerful. Lord \u015aiva drank poison to the\nextent of swallowing an ocean, but if any common man tries to drink even a\nfragment of such poison, he will be killed. There are many psuedo-devotees of\nLord \u015aiva who want to indulge in smoking g\u0101\u00f1j\u0101 (marijuana) and similar\nintoxicating drugs, forgetting that by so imitating the acts of Lord \u015aiva they\nare calling death very near. Similarly, there are some psuedo-devotees of Lord\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a who prefer to imitate the Lord in His r\u0101sa-l\u012bl\u0101, or dance of love,\nforgetting their inability to lift Govardhana Hill. It is best, therefore, that\none not try to imitate the powerful, but simply follow their instructions; nor\nshould one try to occupy their posts without qualification.

TRANSLATION  Therefore, O Arjuna, surrendering all your works unto Me, with mind intent on\nMe, and without desire for gain and free from egoism and lethargy, fight.  PURPORT  This verse clearly indicates the purpose of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. The Lord\ninstructs that one has to become fully K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious to discharge duties, as\nif in military discipline. Such an injunction may make things a little\ndifficult; nevertheless duties must be carried out, with dependence on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a,\nbecause that is the constitutional position of the living entity. The living\nentity cannot be happy independant of the cooperation of the Supreme Lord\nbecause the eternal constitutional position of the living entity is to become\nsubordinate to the desires of the Lord. Arjuna was, therefore, ordered by \u015ar\u012b\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to fight as if the Lord were his military commander. One has to sacrifice\neverything for the good will of the Supreme Lord, and at the same time discharge\nprescribed duties without claiming proprietorship. Arjuna did not have to\nconsider the order of the Lord; he had only to execute His order. The Supreme\nLord is the Soul of all souls; therefore, one who depends solely and wholly on\nthe Supreme Soul without personal consideration, or in other words, one who is\nfully K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, is called adhy\u0101tma-cetas\u0101. Nir\u0101\u015b\u012b\u1e25 means that one has to\nact on the order of the master. Nor should one ever expect fruitive results. The\ncashier may count millions of dollars for his employer, but he does not claim a\ncent for himself. Similarly, one has to realize that nothing in the world\nbelongs to any individual person, but that everything belongs to the Supreme\nLord. That is the real purport of mayi, or unto Me. And when one acts in such\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, certainly he does not claim proprietorship over anything.\nThis consciousness is called nirmama, or nothing is mine. And, if there is any\nreluctance to execute such a stern order which is without consideration of\nso-called kinsmen in the bodily relationship, that reluctance should be thrown\noff; in this way one may become vigata-jvara, or without feverish mentality or\nlethargy. Everyone, according to his quality and position, has a particular type\nof work to discharge, and all such duties may be discharged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness, as described above.

As the\nVedas are eternal, so this truth of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is also eternal. One\nshould have firm faith in this injunction, without envying the Lord.

But an\nordinary man with firm faith in the eternal injunctions of the Lord, even though\nunable to execute such orders, becomes liberated from the bondage of the law of\nkarma. In the beginning of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, one may not fully discharge the\ninjunctions of the Lord, but because one is not resentful of this principle and\nworks sincerely without consideration of defeat and hopelessness, he will surely\nbe promoted to the stage of pure K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.",

PURPORT  Unless one is situated on the transcendental platform of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, he\ncannot get free from the influence of the modes of material nature, as it is\nconfirmed by the Lord in the Seventh Chapter (7.14). Therefore, even for the\nmost highly educated person on the mundane plane, it is impossible to get out of\nthe entanglement of m\u0101y\u0101 simply by theoretical knowledge, or by separating the\nsoul from the body. There are many so-called spiritualists who outwardly pose to\nbe advanced in the science, but inwardly or privately are completely under the\nparticular modes of nature which they are unable to surpass. Academically, one\nmay be very learned, but because of his long association with material nature,\nhe is in bondage. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness helps one to get out of the material\nentanglement, even though one may be engaged in his prescribed duties.\nTherefore, without being fully in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, no one should suddenly\ngive up his prescribed duties and become a so-called yog\u012b or transcendentalist\nartificially. It is better to be situated in one\u2019s position and to try to attain\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness under superior training. Thus one may be freed from the\nclutches of m\u0101y\u0101.",

TRANSLATION  Attraction and repulsion for sense objects are felt by embodied beings, but one\nshould not fall under the control of senses and sense objects because they are\nstumbling blocks on the path of self-realization.  PURPORT  Those who are in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness are naturally reluctant to engage in\nmaterial sense gratifications. But those who are not in such consciousness\nshould follow the rules and regulations of the revealed scriptures. Unrestricted\nsense enjoyment is the cause of material encagement, but one who follows the\nrules and regulations of the revealed scriptures does not become entangled by\nthe sense objects. For example, sex enjoyment is a necessity for the conditioned\nsoul, and sex enjoyment is allowed under the license of marriage ties. For\nexample, according to scriptural injunctions, one is forbidden to engage in sex\nrelationships with any women other than one\u2019s wife. All other women are to be\nconsidered as one\u2019s mother. But, in spite of such injunctions, a man is still\ninclined to have sex relationships with other women. These propensities are to\nbe curbed; otherwise they will be stumbling blocks on the path of\nself-realization. As long as the material body is there, the necessities of the\nmaterial body are allowed, but under rules and regulations. And yet, we should\nnot rely upon the control of such allowances. One has to follow those rules and\nregulations, unattached to them, because practice of sense gratifications under\nregulations may also lead one to go astray\u2014as much as there is always the chance\nof an accident, even on the royal roads. Although they may be very carefully\nmaintained, no one can guarantee that there will be no danger even on the safest\nroad. The sense enjoyment spirit has been current a very long, long time, owing\nto material association. Therefore, in spite of regulated sense enjoyment, there\nis every chance of falling down; therefore any attachment for regulated sense\nenjoyment must also be avoided by all means. But action in the loving service of\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a detaches one from all kinds of sensory activities. Therefore, no one\nshould try to be detached from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness at any stage of life. The\nwhole purpose of detachment from all kinds of sense attachment is ultimately to\nbecome situated on the platform of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.",

Destruction in the course of performing one\u2019s own\nduty is better than engaging in another\u2019s duties, for to follow another\u2019s path\nis dangerous.  PURPORT  One should therefore discharge his prescribed duties in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness\nrather than those prescribed for others. Prescribed duties complement one\u2019s\npsychophysical condition, under the spell of the modes of material nature.\nSpiritual duties are as ordered by the spiritual master, for the transcendental\nservice of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. But both materially or spiritually, one should stick to his\nprescribed duties even up to death, rather than imitate another\u2019s prescribed\nduties. Duties on the spiritual platform and duties on the material platform may\nbe different, but the principle of following the authorized direction is always\ngood for the performer. When one is under the spell of the modes of material\nnature, one should follow the prescribed rules for particular situations and\nshould not imitate others. For example, a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, who is in the mode of\ngoodness, is nonviolent, whereas a k\u1e63atriya, who is in the mode of passion, is\nallowed to be violent. As such, for a k\u1e63atriya it is better to be vanquished\nfollowing the rules of violence than to imitate a br\u0101hma\u1e47a who follows the\nprinciples of nonviolence. Everyone has to cleanse his heart by a gradual\nprocess, not abruptly. However, when one transcends the modes of material nature\nand is fully situated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, he can perform anything and\neverything under the direction of the bona fide spiritual master. In that\ncomplete stage of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, the k\u1e63atriya may act as a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, or a\nbr\u0101hma\u1e47a may act as a k\u1e63atriya. In the transcendental stage, the distinctions of\nthe material world do not apply. For example, Vi\u015bv\u0101mitra was originally a\nk\u1e63atriya, but later on he acted as a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, whereas Para\u015bur\u0101ma was a\nbr\u0101hma\u1e47a, but later on he acted as a k\u1e63atriya. Being transcendentally situated,\nthey could do so; but as long as one is on the material platform, he must\nperform his duties according to the modes of material nature. At the same time,\nhe must have a full sense of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.",

TRANSLATION  The Blessed Lord said: It is lust only, Arjuna, which is born of contact with\nthe material modes of passion and later transformed into wrath, and which is the\nall-devouring, sinful enemy of this world.  PURPORT  When a living entity comes in contact with the material creation, his eternal\nlove for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is transformed into lust, in association with the mode of\npassion. Or, in other words, the sense of love of God becomes transformed into\nlust, as milk in contact with sour tamarind is transformed into yogurt. Then\nagain, when lust is unsatisfied, it turns into wrath; wrath is transformed into\nillusion, and illusion continues the material existence. Therefore, lust is the\ngreatest enemy of the living entity, and it is lust only which induces the pure\nliving entity to remain entangled in the material world. Wrath is the\nmanifestation of the mode of ignorance; these modes exhibit themselves as wrath\nand other corollaries. If, therefore, the modes of passion, instead of being\ndegraded into the modes of ignorance, are elevated to the modes of goodness by\nthe prescribed method of Iiving and acting, then one can be saved from the\ndegradation of wrath by spiritual attachment.  The Supreme Personality of Godhead expanded Himself into many for His\never-increasing spiritual bliss, and the living entities are parts and parcels\nof this spiritual bliss. They also have partial independence, but by misuse of\ntheir independence, when the service attitude is transformed into the propensity\nfor sense enjoyment, they come under the sway of lust. This material creation is\ncreated by the Lord to give a facility to the conditioned souls to fulfill these\nlustful propensities, and when they are completely baffled by prolonged lustful\nactivities, the living entities begin to inquire about their real position.  This inquiry is the beginning of the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btras, wherein it is said, ath\u0101to\nbrahma-jij\u00f1\u0101s\u0101: one should inquire into the Supreme. And the Supreme is defined\nin \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam as janm\u0101dyasya yato \u2019nvay\u0101d itarata\u015b ca, or, \u201cThe origin of\neverything is the Supreme Brahman.\u201d Therefore, the origin of lust is also in the\nSupreme. If, therefore, lust is transformed into love for the Supreme, or\ntransformed into K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness\u2014or, in other words, desiring everything for\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2014then both lust and wrath can be spiritualized. Hanum\u0101n, the great servitor\nof Lord Rama, engaged his wrath upon his enemies for the satisfaction of the\nLord. Therefore, lust and wrath, when they are employed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness,\nbecome our friends instead of our enemies.",

TRANSLATION  As fire is covered by smoke, as a mirror is covered by dust, or as the embryo is\ncovered by the womb, similarly, the living entity is covered by different\ndegrees of this lust.  PURPORT  There are three degrees of covering of the living entity by which his pure\nconsciousness is obscured. This covering is but lust under different\nmanifestations like smoke in the fire, dust on the mirror, and the womb about\nthe embryo. When lust is compared to smoke, it is understood that the fire of\nthe living spark can be a little perceived. In other words, when the living\nentity exhibits his K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness slightly, he may be likened to the fire\ncovered by smoke. Although fire is necessary where there is smoke, there is no\novert manifestation of fire in the early stage. This stage is like the beginning\nof K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. The dust on the mirror refers to a cleansing process of\nthe mirror of the mind by so many spiritual methods. The best process is to\nchant the holy names of the Lord. The embryo covered by the womb is an analogy\nillustrating a helpless position, for the child in the womb is so helpless that\nhe cannot even move. This stage of living condition can be compared to that of\nthe trees. The trees are also living entities, but they have been put in such a\ncondition of life by such a great exhibition of lust that they are almost void\nof all consciousness. The covered mirror is compared to the birds and beasts,\nand the smoke covered fire is compared to the human being. In the form of a\nhuman being, the living entity may revive a little K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, and, if\nhe makes further development, the fire of spiritual life can be kindled in the\nhuman form of life. By careful handling of the smoke in the fire, the fire can\nbe made to blaze. Therefore the human form of life is a chance for the living\nentity to escape the entanglement of material existence. In the human form of\nlife, one can conquer the enemy, lust, by cultivation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness\nunder able guidance.",

PURPORT  It is said in the Manu-sm\u1e5bti that lust cannot be satisfied by any amount of\nsense enjoyment, just as fire is never extinguished by a constant supply of\nfuel. In the material world, the center of all activities is sex, and thus this\nmaterial world is called maithu\u1e47ya-\u0101g\u0101ra, or the shackles of sex life.

TRANSLATION  The senses, the mind and the intelligence are the sitting places of this lust,\nwhich veils the real knowledge of the living entity and bewilders him.  PURPORT  The enemy has captured different strategic positions in the body of the\nconditioned soul, and therefore Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is giving hints of those places, so\nthat one who wants to conquer the enemy may know where he can be found. Mind is\nthe center of all the activities of the senses, and thus the mind is the\nreservoir of all ideas of sense gratification; and, as a result, the mind and\nthe senses become the repositories of lust. Next, the intelligence department\nbecomes the capital of such lustful propensities. Intelligence is the immediate\nnext-door neighbor of the spirit soul. Lusty intelligence influences the spirit\nsoul to acquire the false ego and identify itself with matter, and thus with the\nmind and senses. The spirit soul becomes addicted to enjoying the material\nsenses and mistakes this as true happiness. This false identification of the\nspirit soul is very nicely explained in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam:  yasy\u0101tma-buddhi\u1e25 ku\u1e47\u0101pe tri-dh\u0101tuke sva-dh\u012b\u1e25 kalatr\u0101di\u1e63u bhauma idyadh\u012b\u1e25\nyat-t\u012brtha-buddhi\u1e25 salite na karhicij jane\u1e63v abhij\u00f1e\u1e63u sa eva gokhara\u1e25.  \u201cA human being who identifies this body made of three elements with his self,\nwho considers the by-products of the body to be his kinsmen, who considers the\nland of birth as worshipable, and who goes to the place of pilgrimage simply to\ntake a bath rather than meet men of transcendental knowledge there, is to be\nconsidered as an ass or a cow.\u201d",

TRANSLATION  Therefore, O Arjuna, best of the Bh\u0101ratas, in the very beginning curb this great\nsymbol of sin [lust] by regulating the senses, and slay this destroyer of\nknowledge and self-realization.  PURPORT  The Lord advised Arjuna to regulate the senses from the very beginning so that\nhe could curb the greatest sinful enemy, lust, which destroys the urge for\nself-realization, and specifically, knowledge of the self. J\u00f1\u0101nam refers to\nknowledge of self as distinguished from non-self, or, in other words, knowledge\nthat the spirit soul is not the body. Vij\u00f1\u0101nam refers to specific knowledge of\nthe spirit soul and knowledge of one\u2019s constitutional position and his\nrelationship to the Supreme Soul. It is explained thus in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam:\nj\u00f1\u0101na\u1e41 parama-guhya\u1e41 me yad-vij\u00f1\u0101na-samanvitam / sarahasya\u1e41 tad-a\u1e45ga\u1e41 ca g\u1e5bh\u0101na\ngadita\u1e41 may\u0101: \u201cThe knowledge of the self and the Supreme Self is very\nconfidential and mysterious, being veiled by m\u0101y\u0101, but such knowledge and\nspecific realization can be understood if it is explained by the Lord Himself.\u201d\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 gives us that knowledge, specifically knowledge of the self. The\nliving entities are parts and parcels of the Lord, and therefore they are simply\nmeant to serve the Lord. This consciousness is called K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. So,\nfrom the very beginning of life one has to learn this K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, and\nthereby one may become fully K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious and act accordingly.  Lust is only the perverted reflection of the love of God which is natural for\nevery living entity. But if one is educated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness from the very\nbeginning, that natural love of God cannot deteriorate into lust. When love of\nGod deteriorates into lust, it is very difficult to return to the normal\ncondition. Nonetheless, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is so powerful that even a late\nbeginner can become a lover of God by following the regulative principles of\ndevotional service. So, from any stage of life, or from the time of\nunderstanding its urgency, one can begin regulating the senses in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness, devotional service of the Lord, and turn the lust into love of\nGodhead\u2014the highest perfectional stage of human life.",

TRANSLATION  The working senses are superior to dull matter; mind is higher than the senses;\nintelligence is still higher than the mind; and he [the soul] is even higher\nthan the intelligence.  PURPORT  The senses are different outlets for the activities of lust. Lust is reserved\nwithin the body, but it is given vent through the senses. Therefore, the senses\nare superior to the body as a whole. These outlets are not in use when there is\nsuperior consciousness, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. In K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness the soul\nmakes direct connection with the Supreme Personality of Godhead; therefore the\nbodily functions, as described here, ultimately end in the Supreme Soul. Bodily\naction means the functions of the senses, and stopping the senses means stopping\nall bodily actions. But since the mind is active, then, even though the body may\nbe silent and at rest, the mind will act\u2014as it does during dreaming. But, above\nthe mind there is the determination of the intelligence, and above the\nintelligence is the soul proper. If, therefore, the soul is directly engaged\nwith the Supreme, naturally all other subordinates, namely, the intelligence,\nmind and the senses, will be automatically engaged. In the Ka\u1e6dha Upani\u1e63ad there\nis a passage in which it is said that the objects of sense gratification are\nsuperior to the senses, and mind is superior to the sense objects. If,\ntherefore, the mind is directly engaged in the service of the Lord constantly,\nthen there is no chance of the senses becoming engaged in other ways. This\nmental attitude has already been explained. If the mind is engaged in the\ntranscendental service of the Lord, there is no chance of its being engaged in\nthe lower propensities. In the Ka\u1e6dha Upani\u1e63ad the soul has been described as\nmah\u0101n, the great. Therefore the soul is above all\u2014namely, the sense objects, the\nsenses, the mind and the intelligence. Therefore, directly understanding the\nconstitutional position of the soul is the solution of the whole problem.  With intelligence one has to seek out the constitutional position of the soul\nand then engage the mind always in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. That solves the whole\nproblem. A neophyte spiritualist is generally advised to keep aloof from the\nobjects of senses. One has to strengthen the mind by use of intelligence. If by\nintelligence one engages one\u2019s mind in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, by complete\nsurrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, then, automatically, the mind\nbecomes stronger, and even though the senses are very strong, like serpents,\nthey will be no more effective than serpents with broken fangs. But even though\nthe soul is the master of intelligence and mind, and the senses also, still,\nunless it is strengthened by association with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness,\nthere is every chance of falling down due to the agitated mind.",

TRANSLATION  Thus knowing oneself to be transcendental to material senses, mind and\nintelligence, one should control the lower self by the higher self and thus\u2014by\nspiritual strength\u2014conquer this insatiable enemy known as lust.  PURPORT  This Third Chapter of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is conclusively directive to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness by knowing oneself as the eternal servitor of the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead, without considering impersonal voidness as the ultimate\nend. In the material existence of life, one is certainly influenced by\npropensities for lust and desire for dominating the resources of material\nnature. Desire for overlording and sense gratification are the greatest enemies\nof the conditioned soul; but by the strength of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, one can\ncontrol the material senses, the mind and the intelligence. One may not give up\nwork and prescribed duties all of a sudden; but by gradually developing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness, one can be situated in a transcendental position without being\ninfluenced by the material senses and the mind\u2014by steady intelligence directed\ntoward one\u2019s pure identity. This is the sum total of this chapter. In the\nimmature stage of material existence, philosophical speculations and artificial\nattempts to control the senses by the so-called practice of yogic postures can\nnever help a man toward spiritual life. He must be trained in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness by higher intelligence.",

This science is\nespecially meant for the protection of the inhabitants and therefore the royal\norder should understand it in order to be able to rule the citizens and protect\nthem from the material bondage to lust. Human life is meant for cultivation of\nspiritual knowledge, in eternal relationship with the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead, and the executive heads of all states and all planets are obliged to\nimpart this lesson to the citizens by education, culture and devotion. In other\nwords, the executive heads of all states are intended to spread the science of\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness so that the people may take advantage of this great science\nand pursue a successful path, utilizing the opportunity of the human form of\nlife.\n\n\nIn this millennium, the sun-god is known as Vivasv\u0101n, the king of the sun, which\nis the origin of all planets within the solar system. In the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 [Bs.\n5.52] it is stated:\n\n\nyac-cak\u1e63ur e\u1e63a savit\u0101 sakala-grah\u0101\u1e47\u0101\u1e41 r\u0101j\u0101 samasta-sura-m\u016brttir a\u015be\u1e63a-tej\u0101\u1e25\nyasy\u0101j\u00f1ay\u0101 bhramati sambh\u1e5bta-k\u0101lacakro govindam \u0101di-puru\u1e63a\u1e41 tam aha\u1e41 bhaj\u0101mi\n\n\n\u201cLet me worship,\u201d Lord Brahm\u0101 said, \u201cthe Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda\n[K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a], who is the original person and under whose order the sun, which is the\nking of all planets, is assuming immense power and heat. The sun represents the\neye of the Lord and traverses its orbit in obedience to His order.\u201d\n\n\nThe sun is the king of the planets, and the sun-god (at present of the name\nVivasv\u0101n) rules the sun planet, which is controlling all other planets by\nsupplying heat and light. He is rotating under the order of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and Lord\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a originally made Vivasv\u0101n His first disciple to understand the science of\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. The G\u012bt\u0101 is not, therefore, a speculative treatise for the\ninsignificant mundane scholar but is a standard book of knowledge coming down\nfrom time immemorial. In the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata (\u015a\u0101nti-parva 348.51\u201352) we can trace\nout the history of the G\u012bt\u0101 as follows:\n\n\ntret\u0101-yug\u0101dau ca tato vivasv\u0101n manave dadau manu\u015b ca loka-bh\u1e5bty-artha\u1e41\nsut\u0101yek\u1e63v\u0101kave dadau ik\u1e63v\u0101ku\u1e47\u0101 ca kathito vy\u0101pya lok\u0101n avasthit\u0101\u1e25\n\n\n\u201cIn the beginning of the Tret\u0101-yuga [millennium] this science of the\nrelationship with the Supreme was delivered by Vivasv\u0101n to Manu. Manu, being the\nfather of mankind, gave it to his son Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Ik\u1e63v\u0101ku, the King of this earth\nplanet and forefather of the Raghu dynasty in which Lord R\u0101macandra appeared.\nTherefore, Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 existed in the human society from the time of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja\nIk\u1e63v\u0101ku.\u201d\n\n\nAt the present moment we have just passed through five thousand years of the\nKali-yuga, which lasts 432,000 years. Before this there was Dv\u0101para-yuga\n(800,000 years), and before that there was Tret\u0101-yuga (1,200,000 years). Thus,\nsome 2,005,000 years ago, Manu spoke the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 to his disciple and son\nMah\u0101r\u0101ja lk\u1e63v\u0101ku, the King of this planet earth. The age of the current Manu is\ncalculated to last some 305,300,000 years, of which 120,400,000 have passed.\nAccepting that before the birth of Manu, the G\u012bt\u0101 was spoken by the Lord to His\ndisciple, the sun-god Vivasv\u0101n, a rough estimate is that the G\u012bt\u0101 was spoken at\nleast 120,400,000 years ago; and in human society it has been extant for two\nmillion years. It was respoken by the Lord again to Arjuna about five thousand\nyears ago. That is the rough estimate of the history of the G\u012bta, according to\nthe G\u012bt\u0101 itself and according to the version of the speaker, Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. It\nwas spoken to the sun-god Vivasv\u0101n because he is also a k\u1e63atriya and is the\nfather of all k\u1e63atriyas who are descendants of the sun-god, or the s\u016brya-va\u1e41\u015ba\nk\u1e63atriyas. Because Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is as good as the Vedas, being spoken by the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead, this knowledge is apauru\u1e63eya, superhuman. Since\nthe Vedic instructions are accepted as they are, without human interpretation,\nthe G\u012bt\u0101 must therefore be accepted without mundane interpretation. The mundane\nwranglers may speculate on the G\u012bt\u0101 in their own ways, but that is not\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 as it is. Therefore, Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 has to be accepted as it is,\nfrom the disciplic succession, and it is described herein that the Lord spoke to\nthe sun-god, the sun-god spoke to his son Manu, and Manu spoke to his son\nIk\u1e63v\u0101ku.\n\n\n4.2\n\n\neva\u1e41 parampar\u0101-pr\u0101ptam\n\n\nima\u1e41 r\u0101jar\u1e63ayo vidu\u1e25\n\n\nsa k\u0101leneha mahat\u0101\n\n\nyogo na\u1e63\u1e6da\u1e25 parantapa\n\n\nevam\u2014thus; parampar\u0101\u2014disciplic succession; pr\u0101ptam\u2014received; imam\u2014this science;\nr\u0101jar\u1e63aya\u1e25\u2014the saintly kings; vidu\u1e25\u2014understood; sa\u1e25\u2014that knowledge; k\u0101lena\u2014in\nthe course of time; iha\u2014in this world; mahat\u0101\u2014by great; yoga\u1e25\u2014the science of\none\u2019s relationship with the Supreme; na\u1e63\u1e6da\u1e25\u2014scattered; parantapa\u2014O Arjuna,\nsubduer of the enemies.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThis supreme science was thus received through the chain of disciplic\nsuccession, and the saintly kings understood it in that way. But in course of\ntime the succession was broken, and therefore the science as it is appears to be\nlost.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nIt is clearly stated that the G\u012bt\u0101 was especially meant for the saintly kings\nbecause they were to execute its purpose in ruling over the citizens. Certainly\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 was never meant for the demonic persons, who would dissipate its\nvalue for no one\u2019s benefit and would devise all types of interpretations\naccording to personal whims. As soon as the original purpose was scattered by\nthe motives of the unscrupulous commentators, there arose the need to\nreestablish the disciplic succession. Five thousand years ago it was detected by\nthe Lord Himself that the disciplic succession was broken, and therefore He\ndeclared that the purpose of the G\u012bt\u0101 appeared to be lost. In the same way, at\nthe present moment also there are so many editions of the G\u012bt\u0101 (especially in\nEnglish), but almost all of them are not according to authorized disciplic\nsuccession. There are innumerable interpretations rendered by different mundane\nscholars, but almost all of them do not accept the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, although they make a good business on the words of \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\nThis spirit is demonic, because demons do not believe in God but simply enjoy\nthe property of the Supreme. Since there is a great need of an edition of the\nG\u012bt\u0101 in English, as it is received by the parampar\u0101 (disciplic succession)\nsystem, an attempt is made herewith to fulfill this great want.\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101\u2014accepted as it is\u2014is a great boon to humanity; but if it is\naccepted as a treatise of philosophical speculations, it is simply a waste of\ntime.\n\n\n4.3\n\n\nsa ev\u0101ya\u1e41 may\u0101 te \u2019dya\n\n\nyoga\u1e25 prokta\u1e25 pur\u0101tana\u1e25\n\n\nbhakto \u2019si me sakh\u0101 ceti\n\n\nrahasya\u1e41 hy etad uttamam\n\n\nsa\u1e25\u2014the same ancient; eva\u2014certainly; ayam\u2014this; may\u0101\u2014by Me; te\u2014unto you;\nadya\u2014today; yoga\u1e25\u2014the science of yoga; prokta\u1e25\u2014spoken; pur\u0101tana\u1e25\u2014very old;\nbhakta\u1e25\u2014devotee; asi\u2014you are; me\u2014My; sakh\u0101\u2014friend; ca\u2014also; iti\u2014therefore;\nrahasyam\u2014mystery; hi\u2014certainly; etat\u2014this; uttamam\u2014transcendental.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThat very ancient science of the relationship with the Supreme is today told by\nMe to you because you are My devotee as well as My friend; therefore you can\nunderstand the transcendental mystery of this science.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThere are two classes of men, namely the devotee and the demon. The Lord\nselected Arjuna as the recipient of this great science owing to his becoming the\ndevotee of the Lord, but for the demon it is not possible to understand this\ngreat mysterious science. There are a number of editions of this great book of\nknowledge, and some of them have commentaries by the devotees, and some of them\nhave commentaries by the demons. Commentation by the devotees is real, whereas\nthat of the demons is useless. Arjuna accepts \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead, and any commentary on the G\u012bt\u0101 following in the\nfootsteps of Arjuna is real devotional service to the cause of this great\nscience. The demonic, however, concoct something about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and mislead the\npublic and general readers from the path of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s instructions. One should try\nto follow the disciplic succession from Arjuna, and thus be benefitted.\n\n\n4.4\n\n\narjuna uv\u0101ca\n\n\napara\u1e41 bhavato janma\n\n\npara\u1e41 janma vivasvata\u1e25\n\n\nkatham etad vij\u0101n\u012by\u0101\u1e41\n\n\ntvam \u0101dau proktav\u0101n iti\n\n\narjuna\u1e25 uv\u0101ca\u2014Arjuna said; aparam\u2014junior; bhavata\u1e25\u2014Your; janma\u2014birth;\nparam\u2014superior; janma\u2014birth; vivasvata\u1e25\u2014of the sun-god; katham\u2014how; etat\u2014this;\nvij\u0101n\u012by\u0101m\u2014shall I understand; tvam\u2014You; \u0101dau\u2014in the beginning;\nproktav\u0101n\u2014instructed; iti\u2014thus.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nArjuna said: The sun-god Vivasv\u0101n is senior by birth to You. How am I to\nunderstand that in the beginning You instructed this science to him?\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nArjuna is an accepted devotee of the Lord, so how could he not believe K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s\nwords? The fact is that Arjuna is not inquiring for himself but for those who do\nnot believe in the Supreme Personality of Godhead or for the demons who do not\nlike the idea that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a should be accepted as the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead; for them only Arjuna inquires on this point, as if he were himself not\naware of the Personality of Godhead, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. As it will be evident from the\nTenth Chapter, Arjuna knew perfectly well that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality\nof Godhead, the fountainhead of everything and the last word in Transcendence.\nOf course, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a also appeared as the son of Devak\u012b on this earth. How K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nremained the same Supreme Personality of Godhead, the eternal, original person,\nis very difficult for an ordinary man to understand. Therefore, to clarify this\npoint, Arjuna put this question before K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a so that He Himself could speak\nauthoritatively. That K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the supreme authority is accepted by the whole\nworld, not only at present, but from time immemorial, and the demons alone\nreject Him. Anyway, since K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the authority accepted by all, Arjuna put\nthis question before Him in order that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a would describe Himself without\nbeing depicted by the demons who always try to distort Him in a way\nunderstandable to the demons and their followers. It is necessary that everyone,\nfor his own interest, know the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore, when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself\nspeaks about Himself, it is auspicious for all the worlds. To the demons, such\nexplanations by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself may appear to be strange because the demons always\nstudy K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a from their own standpoint, but those who are devotees heartily\nwelcome the statements of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a when they are spoken by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself. The\ndevotees will always worship such authoritative statements of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a because they\nare always eager to know more and more about Him. The atheists, who consider\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a an ordinary man, may in this way come to know that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is superhuman,\nthat He is sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha\u2014the eternal form of bliss and knowledge\u2014that\nHe is transcendental, and that He is above the domination of the modes of\nmaterial nature and above the influence of time and space. A devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s,\nlike Arjuna, is undoubtedly above any misunderstanding of the transcendental\nposition of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Arjuna\u2019s putting this question before the Lord is simply an\nattempt by the devotee to defy the atheistic attitude of persons who consider\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to be an ordinary human being subject to the modes of material nature.\n\n\n4.5\n\n\n\u015br\u012b-bhagav\u0101n uv\u0101ca\n\n\nbah\u016bni me vyat\u012bt\u0101ni\n\n\njanm\u0101ni tava c\u0101rjuna\n\n\nt\u0101ny aha\u1e41 veda sarv\u0101\u1e47i\n\n\nna tva\u1e41 vettha parantapa\n\n\n\u015br\u012b bhagav\u0101n uv\u0101ca\u2014the Personality of Godhead said; bah\u016bni\u2014many; me\u2014of Mine;\nvyat\u012bt\u0101ni\u2014have passed; janm\u0101ni\u2014births; tava\u2014of yours; ca\u2014and also; arjuna\u2014O\nArjuna; t\u0101ni\u2014all those; aham\u2014I; veda\u2014do know; sarv\u0101\u1e47i\u2014all; na\u2014not;\ntvam\u2014yourself; vettha\u2014know; parantapa\u2014O subduer of the enemy.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThe Blessed Lord said: Many, many births both you and I have passed.

Such eternal, blissful, all-knowing forms of the\nLord are usually understood by the best Vedic scholars, but they are always\nmanifest to pure, unalloyed devotees.\u201d It is also stated in Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101:\n\n\nr\u0101m\u0101di m\u016brtti\u1e63u kal\u0101-niyamena ti\u1e63\u1e6dhan n\u0101n\u0101vat\u0101ram akarod bhuvane\u1e63u kintu k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u1e25\nsvaya\u1e41 samabhavat parama\u1e25 pum\u0101n yo govindam \u0101di-puru\u1e63a\u1e41 tam aha\u1e41 bhaj\u0101mi\n\n\n(Bs. 5.39)\n\n\n\u201cI worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda [K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a], who is always\nsituated in various incarnations such as R\u0101ma, N\u1e5bsi\u1e41ha and many sub-incarnations\nas well, but who is the original Personality of Godhead known as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and who\nincarnates personally also.\u201d\n\n\nIn the Vedas also it is said that the Lord, although one without a second,\nnevertheless manifests Himself in innumerable forms. He is like the vaidurya\nstone, which changes color yet still remains one. All those multi-forms are\nunderstood by the pure, unalloyed devotees, but not by a simple study of the\nVedas: vede\u1e63u durllabham adurllabham \u0101tma-bhaktau. Devotees like Arjuna are\nconstant companions of the Lord, and whenever the Lord incarnates, the associate\ndevotees also incarnate in order to serve the Lord in different capacities.\nArjuna is one of these devotees, and in this verse it is understood that some\nmillions of years ago when Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a spoke the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 to the sun-god\nVivasv\u0101n, Arjuna, in a different capacity, was also present. But the difference\nbetween the Lord and Arjuna is that the Lord remembered the incidence, whereas\nArjuna could not remember. That is the difference between the part and parcel\nliving entity and the Supreme Lord. Although Arjuna is addressed herein as the\nmighty hero who could subdue the enemies, he is unable to recall what had\nhappened in his various past births. Therefore, a living entity, however great\nhe may be in the material estimation, can never equal the Supreme Lord. Anyone\nwho is a constant companion of the Lord is certainly a liberated person, but he\ncannot be equal to the Lord. The Lord is described in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 as\ninfallible (acyuta), which means that He never forgets Himself, even though He\nis in material contact. Therefore, the Lord and the living entity can never be\nequal in all respects, even if the living entity is as liberated as Arjuna.\nAlthough Arjuna is a devotee of the Lord, he sometimes forgets the nature of the\nLord, but by the divine grace a devotee can at once understand the infallible\ncondition of the Lord, whereas a nondevotee or a demon cannot understand this\ntranscendental nature. Consequently these descriptions in the G\u012bt\u0101 cannot be\nunderstood by demonic brains. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a remembered acts which were performed by Him\nmillions of years before, but Arjuna could not, despite the fact that both K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nand Arjuna are eternal in nature. We may also note herein that a living entity\nforgets everything due to his change of body, but the Lord remembers because He\ndoes not change His sac-cid-\u0101nanda body. He is advaita, which means there is no\ndistinction between His body and Himself. Everything in relation to Him is\nspirit\u2014whereas the conditioned soul is different from his material body. And,\nbecause the Lord\u2019s body and self are identical, His position is always different\nfrom the ordinary living entity, even when He descends to the material platform.\nThe demons cannot adjust themselves to this transcendental nature of the Lord,\nas the Lord explains in the following verse.\n\n\n4.6\n\n\najo \u2019pi sann avyay\u0101tm\u0101\n\n\nbh\u016bt\u0101n\u0101m \u012b\u015bvaro \u2019pi san\n\n\nprak\u1e5bti\u1e41 sv\u0101m adhi\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101ya\n\n\nsambhav\u0101my \u0101tma-m\u0101yay\u0101\n\n\naja\u1e25\u2014unborn; api\u2014although; san\u2014being so; avyaya\u2014without deterioration;\n\u0101tm\u0101\u2014body; bh\u016bt\u0101n\u0101m\u2014all those who are born; \u012b\u015bvara\u1e25\u2014the Supreme Lord;\napi\u2014although; san\u2014being so; prak\u1e5btim\u2014transcendental form; sv\u0101m\u2014of Myself;\nadhi\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101ya\u2014being so situated; sambhav\u0101mi\u2014I do incarnate; \u0101tma-m\u0101yay\u0101\u2014by My\ninternal energy.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nAlthough I am unborn and My transcendental body never deteriorates, and although\nI am the Lord of all sentient beings, I still appear in every millennium in My\noriginal transcendental form.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe Lord has spoken about the peculiarity of His birth: although He may appear\nlike an ordinary person, He remembers everything of His many, many past\n\u201cbirths,\u201d whereas a common man cannot remember what he has done even a few hours\nbefore. If someone is asked what he did exactly at the same time one day\nearlier, it would be very difficult for a common man to answer immediately. He\nwould surely have to dredge his memory to recall what he was doing exactly at\nthe same time one day before. And yet, men often dare claim to be God, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\nOne should not be misled by such meaningless claims. Then again, the Lord\nexplains His prak\u1e5bti or His form. Prak\u1e5bti means nature as well as svar\u016bpa, or\none\u2019s own form. The Lord says that He appears in His own body. He does not\nchange His body, as the common living entity changes from one body to another.\nThe conditioned soul may have one kind of body in the present birth, but he has\na different body in the next birth. In the material world, the living entity has\nno fixed body but transmigrates from one body to another. The Lord, however,\ndoes not do so. Whenever He appears, He does so in the same original body, by\nHis internal potency. In other words, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a appears in this material world in\nHis original eternal form, with two hands, holding a flute. He appears exactly\nin His eternal body, uncontaminated by this material world. Although He appears\nin the same transcendental body and is Lord of the universe, it still appears\nthat He takes His birth like an ordinary living entity. Despite the fact Lord\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a grows from childhood to boyhood and from boyhood to youth, astonishingly\nenough He never ages beyond youth. At the time of the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra, He\nhad many grandchildren at home; or, in other words, He had sufficiently aged by\nmaterial calculations. Still He looked just like a young man twenty or\ntwenty-five years old. We never see a picture of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in old age because He\nnever grows old like us, although He is the oldest person in the whole\ncreation\u2014past, present, and future. Neither His body nor His intelligence ever\ndeteriorates or changes. Therefore, it is clear that in spite of His being in\nthe material world, He is the same unborn, eternal form of bliss and knowledge,\nchangeless in His transcendental body and intelligence. Factually, His\nappearance and disappearance is like the sun\u2019s rising, moving before us, and\nthen disappearing from our eyesight. When the sun is out of sight, we think that\nthe sun is set, and when the sun is before our eyes, we think that the sun is on\nthe horizon. Actually, the sun is always in its fixed position, but owing to our\ndefective, insufficient senses, we calculate the appearance and disappearance of\nthe sun in the sky. And, because His appearance and disappearance are completely\ndifferent from that of any ordinary, common living entity, it is evident that He\nis eternal, blissful knowledge by His internal potency\u2014and He is never\ncontaminated by material nature. The Vedas also confirm that the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead is unborn, yet He still appears to take His birth in\nmulti-manifestations. The Vedic supplementary literatures also confirm that even\nthough the Lord appears to be taking His birth, He is still without change of\nbody. In the Bh\u0101gavatam, He appears before His mother as N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, with four\nhands and the decorations of the six kinds of full opulences. His appearance in\nHis original eternal form is His causeless mercy, according to the Vi\u015bvako\u015ba\ndictionary. The Lord is conscious of all of His previous appearances and\ndisappearances, but a common living entity forgets everything about his past\nbody as soon as he gets another body. He is the Lord of all living entities\nbecause He performs wonderful and superhuman activities while He is on this\nearth. Therefore, the Lord is always the same Absolute Truth and is without\ndifferentiation between His form and self, or between His quality and body. A\nquestion may now be raised as to why the Lord appears and disappears in this\nworld. This is explained in the next verse.\n\n\n4.7\n\n\nyad\u0101 yad\u0101 hi dharmasya\n\n\ngl\u0101nir bhavati bh\u0101rata\n\n\nabhyutth\u0101nam adharmasya\n\n\ntad\u0101tm\u0101na\u1e41 s\u1e5bj\u0101my aham\n\n\nyad\u0101\u2014whenever; yad\u0101\u2014wherever; hi\u2014certainly; dharmasya\u2014of religion;\ngl\u0101ni\u1e25\u2014discrepancies; bhavati\u2014manifested, becomes; bh\u0101rata\u2014O descendant of\nBharata; abhyutth\u0101nam\u2014predominance; adharmasya\u2014of irreligion; tad\u0101\u2014at that time;\n\u0101tm\u0101nam\u2014self; s\u1e5bj\u0101mi\u2014manifest; aham\u2014I.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nWhenever and wherever there is a decline in religious practice, O descendant of\nBharata, and a predominant rise of irreligion\u2014at that time I descend Myself.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe word s\u1e5bj\u0101mi is significant herein. S\u1e5bj\u0101mi cannot be used in the sense of\ncreation. because, according to the previous verse, there is no creation of the\nLord\u2019s form or body, since all of the forms are eternally existent. Therefore\ns\u1e5bj\u0101mi means that the Lord manifests Himself as He is. Although the Lord appears\non schedule, namely at the end of Dv\u0101para-yuga of the twenty-eighth millennium\nof the eighth Manu, in one day of Brahm\u0101, still He has no obligation to adhere\nto such rules and regulations because He is completely free to act in many ways\nat His will. He therefore appears by His own will whenever there is a\npredominance of irreligiosity and a disappearance of true religion. Principles\nof religion are laid down in the Vedas, and any discrepancy in the matter of\nproperly executing the rules of the Vedas makes one irreligious. In the\nBh\u0101gavatam it is stated that such principles are the laws of the Lord. Only the\nLord can manufacture a system of religion. The Vedas are also accepted as\noriginally spoken by the Lord Himself to Brahm\u0101, from within his heart.\nTherefore, the principles of dharma, or religion, are the direct orders of the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead (dharma\u1e41 tu s\u0101k\u1e63\u0101t-bhagavat-pra\u1e47\u012btam). These\nprinciples are clearly indicated throughout the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. The purpose of\nthe Vedas is to establish such principles under the order of the Supreme Lord,\nand the Lord directly orders, at the end of the G\u012bt\u0101, that the highest principle\nof religion is to surrender unto Him only, and nothing more. The Vedic\nprinciples push one towards complete surrender unto Him; and, whenever such\nprinciples are disturbed by the demonic, the Lord appears. From the Bh\u0101gavatam\nwe understand that Lord Buddha is the incarnation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a who appeared when\nmaterialism was rampant and materialists were using the pretext of the authority\nof the Vedas. Although there are certain restrictive rules and regulations\nregarding animal sacrifice for particular purposes in the Vedas, people of\ndemonic tendency still took to animal sacrifice without reference to the Vedic\nprinciples. Lord Buddha appeared to stop this nonsense and to establish the\nVedic principles of nonviolence. Therefore each and every avat\u0101ra, or\nincarnation of the Lord, has a particular mission, and they are all described in\nthe revealed scriptures. No one should be accepted as an avat\u0101ra unless he is\nreferred to by scriptures. It is not a fact that the Lord appears only on Indian\nsoil. He can advent Himself anywhere and everywhere, and whenever He desires to\nappear. In each and every incarnation, He speaks as much about religion as can\nbe understood by the particular people under their particular circumstances. But\nthe mission is the same\u2014to lead people to God consciousness and obedience to the\nprinciples of religion. Sometimes He descends personally, and sometimes He sends\nHis bona fide representative in the form of His son, or servant, or Himself in\nsome disguised form.\n\n\nThe principles of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 were spoken to Arjuna, and, for that matter,\nto other highly elevated persons, because he was highly advanced compared to\nordinary persons in other parts of the world. Two plus two equals four is a\nmathematical principle that is true both in the beginner\u2019s arithmetic class and\nin the advanced class as well. Still, there are higher and lower mathematics. In\nall incarnations of the Lord, therefore, the same principles are taught, but\nthey appear to be higher and lower in varied circumstances. The higher\nprinciples of religion begin with the acceptance of the four orders and the four\nstatuses of social life, as will be explained later. The whole purpose of the\nmission of incarnations is to arouse K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness everywhere. Such\nconsciousness is manifest and nonmanifest only under different circumstances.\n\n\n4.8\n\n\nparitr\u0101\u1e47\u0101ya s\u0101dh\u016bn\u0101\u1e41\n\n\nvin\u0101\u015b\u0101ya ca du\u1e63k\u1e5bt\u0101m\n\n\ndharma-sa\u1e41sth\u0101pan\u0101rth\u0101ya\n\n\nsambhav\u0101mi yuge yuge\n\n\nparitr\u0101\u1e47\u0101ya\u2014for the deliverance; s\u0101dh\u016bn\u0101m\u2014of the devotees; vin\u0101\u015b\u0101ya\u2014for the\nannihilation; ca\u2014also; du\u1e63k\u1e5bt\u0101m\u2014of the miscreants; dharma\u2014principles of\nreligion; sa\u1e41sth\u0101pana-arth\u0101ya\u2014to reestablish; sambhav\u0101mi\u2014I do appear;\nyuge\u2014millennium; yuge\u2014after millennium.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nIn order to deliver the pious and to annihilate the miscreants, as well as to\nreestablish the principles of religion, I advent Myself millennium after\nmillennium.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nAccording to Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, a s\u0101dhu (holyman) is a man in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. A\nperson may appear to be irreligious, but if he has the qualifications of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness wholly and fully, he is to be understood to be a s\u0101dhu. And\ndu\u1e63k\u1e5btam applies to one who doesn\u2019t care for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Such\nmiscreants, or du\u1e63k\u1e5btam, are described as foolish and the lowest of mankind,\neven though they may be decorated with mundane education; whereas another\nperson, who is one hundred percent engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, is accepted\nas s\u0101dhu, even though such a person may neither be learned nor well cultured. As\nfar as the atheistic are concerned, it is not necessary for the Supreme Lord to\nappear as He is to destroy them, as He did with the demons R\u0101va\u1e47a and Ka\u1e41sa. The\nLord has many agents who are quite competent to vanquish demons. But the Lord\nespecially descends to appease His unalloyed devotees, who are always harassed\nby the demonic. The demon harasses the devotee, even though the latter may\nhappen to be his kin. Although Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was the son of Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu,\nhe was nonetheless persecuted by his father; although Devak\u012b, the mother of\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, was the sister of Ka\u1e41sa, she and her husband Vasudeva were persecuted\nonly because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was to be born of them. So Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a appeared primarily to\ndeliver Devak\u012b, rather than kill Ka\u1e41sa, but both were performed simultaneously.\nTherefore it is said here that to deliver the devotee and vanquish the demon\nmiscreants, the Lord appears in different incarnations.\n\n\nIn the Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47ad\u0101sa Kavir\u0101ja, the following verses summarize\nthese principles of incarnation:\n\n\ns\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6di-hetu yei m\u016brti prapa\u00f1ce avatare sei \u012b\u015bvara-m\u016brti \u2018avat\u0101ra\u2019 n\u0101ma dhare\nm\u0101y\u0101tita paravyome sav\u0101ra avasth\u0101na vi\u015bve \u2018avat\u0101ri\u2019 dhare \u2018avat\u0101ra\u2019 n\u0101ma.\n\n\n\u201cThe avat\u0101ra, or incarnation of Godhead, descends from the kingdom of God for\nmaterial manifestation. And the particular form of the Personality of Godhead\nwho so descends is called an incarnation, or avat\u0101ra. Such incarnations are\nsituated in the spiritual world, the kingdom of God. When they descend to the\nmaterial creation, they assume the name avat\u0101ra.\u201d\n\n\nThere are various kinds of avat\u0101ras, such as puru\u1e63\u0101vat\u0101ras, gu\u1e47\u0101vat\u0101ras,\nl\u012bl\u0101vat\u0101ras, \u015bakty\u0101ve\u015ba avat\u0101ras, manvantara-avat\u0101ras and yug\u0101vat\u0101ras\u2014all\nappearing on schedule all over the universe. But Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the primeval\nLord, the fountainhead of all avat\u0101ras. Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a descends for the specific\npurposes of mitigating the anxieties of the pure devotees, who are very anxious\nto see Him in His original V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana pastimes. Therefore, the prime purpose of\nthe K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a avat\u0101ra is to satisfy His unalloyed devotees.\n\n\nThe Lord says that He incarnates Himself in every millennium. This indicates\nthat He incarnates also in the age of Kali. As stated in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,\nthe incarnation in the age of Kali is Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu, who spread the\nworship of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by the sa\u1e45k\u012brtana movement (congregational chanting of the holy\nnames), and spread K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness throughout India. He predicted that this\nculture of sa\u1e45k\u012brtana would be broadcast all over the world, from town to town\nand village to village. Lord Caitanya as the incarnation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the\nPersonality of Godhead, is described secretly but not directly in the\nconfidential parts of the revealed scriptures, such as the Upani\u1e63ads,\nMah\u0101bh\u0101rata, Bh\u0101gavatam, etc. The devotees of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are much attracted by\nthe sa\u1e45k\u012brtana movement of Lord Caitanya. This avat\u0101ra of the Lord does not kill\nthe miscreants, but delivers them by the causeless mercy of the Lord.\n\n\n4.9\n\n\njanma karma ca me divyam\n\n\neva\u1e41 yo vetti tattvata\u1e25\n\n\ntyaktv\u0101 deha\u1e41 punar janma\n\n\nnaiti m\u0101m eti so \u2019rjuna\n\n\njanma\u2014birth; karma\u2014work; ca\u2014also; me\u2014of Mine; divyam\u2014transcendental; evam\u2014like\nthis; ya\u1e25\u2014anyone who; vetti\u2014knows; tattvata\u1e25\u2014in reality; tyaktv\u0101\u2014leaving aside;\ndeham\u2014this body; puna\u1e25\u2014again; janma\u2014birth; na\u2014never; eti\u2014does attain; m\u0101m\u2014unto\nMe; eti\u2014does attain; sa\u1e25\u2014he; arjuna\u2014O Arjuna.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nOne who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does\nnot, upon leaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but\nattains My eternal abode, O Arjuna.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe Lord\u2019s descent from His transcendental abode is already explained in the 6th\nverse. One who can understand the truth of the appearance of the Personality of\nGodhead is already liberated from material bondage, and therefore he returns to\nthe kingdom of God immediately after quitting this present material body. Such\nliberation of the living entity from material bondage is not at all easy. The\nimpersonalists and the yog\u012bs attain liberation only after much trouble and many,\nmany births. Even then, the liberation they achieve\u2014merging into the impersonal\nbrahmajyoti of the Lord\u2014is only partial, and there is the risk of returning\nagain to this material world. But the devotee, simply by understanding the\ntranscendental nature of the body and activities of the Lord, attains the abode\nof the Lord after ending this body and does not run the risk of returning again\nto this material world. In the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 it is stated that the Lord has\nmany, many forms and incarnations: advaitam acyutam an\u0101dim ananta-r\u016bpam.\nAlthough there are many transcendental forms of the Lord, they are still one and\nthe same Supreme Personality of Godhead. One has to understand this fact with\nconviction, although it is incomprehensible to mundane scholars and empiric\nphilosophers. As stated in the Vedas:\n\n\neko devo nitya-l\u012bl\u0101nurakto bhakta-vy\u0101p\u012b h\u1e5bdy antar\u0101tm\u0101.\n\n\n\u201cThe one Supreme Personality of Godhead is eternally engaged in many, many\ntranscendental forms in relationships with His unalloyed devotees.\u201d This Vedic\nversion is confirmed in this verse of the G\u012bt\u0101 personally by the Lord. He who\naccepts this truth on the strength of the authority of the Vedas and of the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead and who does not waste time in philosophical\nspeculations attains the highest perfectional stage of liberation. Simply by\naccepting this truth on faith, one can, without a doubt, attain liberation. The\nVedic version, \u201ctattvamasi,\u201d is actually applied in this case. Anyone who\nunderstands Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to be the Supreme, or who says unto the Lord, \u201cYou are\nthe same Supreme Brahman, the Personality of Godhead\u201d is certainly liberated\ninstantly, and consequently his entrance into the transcendental association of\nthe Lord is guaranteed. In other words, such a faithful devotee of the Lord\nattains perfection, and this is confirmed by the following Vedic assertion:\n\n\ntam eva viditv\u0101tim\u1e5btyumeti n\u0101nya\u1e25 panth\u0101 vidyate ayan\u0101ya.\n\n\nOne can attain the perfect stage of liberation from birth and death simply by\nknowing the Lord, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. There is no alternative\nbecause anyone who does not understand Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead is surely in the mode of ignorance. Consequently he will not attain\nsalvation, simply, so to speak, by licking the outer surface of the bottle of\nhoney, or by interpreting the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 according to mundane scholarship.\nSuch empiric philosophers may assume very important roles in the material world,\nbut they are not necessarily eligible for liberation. Such puffed up mundane\nscholars have to wait for the causeless mercy of the devotee of the Lord. One\nshould therefore cultivate K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness with faith and knowledge, and in\nthis way attain perfection.\n\n\n4.10\n\n\nv\u012bta-r\u0101ga-bhaya-krodh\u0101\n\n\nman-may\u0101 m\u0101m up\u0101\u015brit\u0101\u1e25\n\n\nbahavo j\u00f1\u0101na-tapas\u0101\n\n\np\u016bt\u0101 mad-bh\u0101vam \u0101gat\u0101\u1e25\n\n\nv\u012bta\u2014freed from; r\u0101ga\u2014attachment; bhaya\u2014fear; krodh\u0101\u1e25\u2014anger; mat-may\u0101\u2014fully in\nMe; m\u0101m\u2014unto Me; up\u0101\u015brit\u0101\u1e25\u2014being fully situated; bahava\u1e25\u2014many; j\u00f1\u0101na\u2014knowledge;\ntapas\u0101\u2014by penance; p\u016bt\u0101\u1e25\u2014being purified; mat-bh\u0101vam\u2014transcendental love for Me;\n\u0101gat\u0101\u1e25\u2014attained.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nBeing freed from attachment, fear and anger, being fully absorbed in Me and\ntaking refuge in Me, many, many persons in the past became purifled by knowledge\nof Me\u2014and thus they all attained transcendental love for Me.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nAs described above, it is very difficult for a person who is too materially\naffected to understand the personal nature of the Supreme Absolute Truth.\nGenerally, people who are attached to the bodily conception of life are so\nabsorbed in materialism that it is almost impossible for them to understand that\nthere is a transcendental body which is imperishable, full of knowledge and\neternally blissful. In the materialistic concept, the body is perishable, full\nof ignorance and completely miserable. Therefore, people in general keep this\nsame bodily idea in mind when they are informed of the personal form of the\nLord. For such materialistic men, the form of the gigantic material\nmanifestation is supreme. Consequently they consider the Supreme to be\nimpersonal. And because they are too materially absorbed, the conception of\nretaining the personality after liberation from matter frightens them. When they\nare informed that spiritual life is also individual and personal, they become\nafraid of becoming persons again, and so they naturally prefer a kind of merging\ninto the impersonal void. Generally, they compare the living entities to the\nbubbles of the ocean, which merge into the ocean. That is the highest perfection\nof spiritual existence attainable without individual personality. This is a kind\nof fearful stage of life, devoid of perfect knowledge of spiritual existence.\nFurthermore there are many persons who cannot understand spiritual existence at\nall. Being embarassed by so many theories and by contradictions of various types\nof philosophical speculation, they become disgusted or angry and foolishly\nconclude that there is no supreme cause and that everything is ultimately void.\nSuch people are in a diseased condition of life. Some people are too materially\nattached and therefore do not give attention to spiritual life, some of them\nwant to merge into the supreme spiritual cause, and some of them disbelieve in\neverything, being angry at all sorts of spiritual speculation out of\nhopelessness. This last class of men take to the shelter of some kind of\nintoxication, and their affective hallucinations are sometimes accepted as\nspiritual vision. One has to get rid of all three stages of attachment to the\nmaterial world: negligence of spiritual life, fear of a spiritual personal\nidentity, and the conception of void that underlies the frustration of life. To\nget free from these three stages of the material concept of life, one has to\ntake complete shelter of the Lord, guided by the bona fide spiritual master, and\nfollow the disciplines and regulative principles of devotional life. The last\nstage of the devotional life is called bh\u0101va, or transcendental love of Godhead.\n\n\nAccording to Bhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu, the science of devotional service:\n\n\n\u0101dau \u015braddh\u0101 tata\u1e25 s\u0101dhu-sa\u1e45go \u2019tha bhajana-kriy\u0101 tato \u2019nartha-niv\u1e5btti\u1e25 sy\u0101t\ntato ni\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101 rucis tata\u1e25 ath\u0101saktis tato bh\u0101vas tata\u1e25 prem\u0101bhyuda\u00f1cati s\u0101dhak\u0101n\u0101m\naya\u1e41 prem\u1e47a\u1e25 pr\u0101durbh\u0101ve bhavet krama\u1e25.\n\n\n\u201cIn the beginning one must have a preliminary desire for self-realization. This\nwill bring one to the stage of trying to associate with persons who are\nspiritually elevated. In next stage one becomes initiated by an elevated\nspiritual master, and under his instruction the neophyte devotee begins the\nprocess of devotional service. By execution of devotional service under the\nguidance of the spiritual master, one becomes free from all material attachment,\nattains steadiness in self-realization, and acquires a taste for hearing about\nthe Absolute Personality of Godhead, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This taste leads one further\nforward to attachment for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, which is matured in bh\u0101va, or the\npreliminary stage of transcendental love of God. Real love for God is called\nprem\u0101, the highest perfectional stage of life.\u201d In the prem\u0101 stage there is\nconstant engagement in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. So, by the\nslow process of devotional service, under the guidance of the bona fide\nspiritual master, one can attain the highest stage, being freed from all\nmaterial attachment, from the fearfulness of one\u2019s individual spiritual\npersonality, and from the frustrations resulting from void philosophy. Then one\ncan ultimately attain to the abode of the Supreme Lord.\n\n\n4.11\n\n\nye yath\u0101 m\u0101\u1e41 prapadyante\n\n\nt\u0101\u1e41s tathaiva bhaj\u0101my aham\n\n\nmama vartm\u0101nuvartante\n\n\nmanu\u1e63y\u0101\u1e25 p\u0101rtha sarva\u015ba\u1e25\n\n\nye\u2014all of them; yath\u0101\u2014as; m\u0101m\u2014unto Me; prapadyante\u2014surrender; t\u0101n\u2014unto them;\ntath\u0101\u2014so; eva\u2014certainly; bhaj\u0101mi\u2014do I reward; aham\u2014I; mama\u2014My; vartma\u2014path;\nanuvartante\u2014do follow; manu\u1e63y\u0101\u1e25\u2014all men; p\u0101rtha\u2014O son of P\u1e5bth\u0101; sarva\u015ba\u1e25\u2014in all\nrespects.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nAll of them\u2014as they surrender unto Me\u2014I reward accordingly.

But K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is only fully\nrealized by His pure devotees. Consequently, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the object of everyone\u2019s\nrealization, and thus anyone and everyone is satisfied according to one\u2019s desire\nto have Him. In the transcendental world also, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a reciprocates with His pure\ndevotees in the transcendental attitude, just as the devotee wants Him. One\ndevotee may want K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as supreme master, another as his personal friend,\nanother as his son, and still another as his lover. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a rewards all the\ndevotees equally, according to their different intensities of love for Him. In\nthe material world, the same reciprocations of feelings are there, and they are\nequally exchanged by the Lord with the different types of worshipers. The pure\ndevotees both here and in the transcendental abode associate with Him in person\nand are able to render personal service to the Lord and thus derive\ntranscendental bliss in His loving service. As for those who are impersonalists\nand who want to commit spiritual suicide by annihilating the individual\nexistence of the living entity, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a helps also by absorbing them into His\neffulgence. Such impersonalists do not agree to accept the eternal, blissful\nPersonality of Godhead; consequently they cannot relish the bliss of\ntranscendental personal service to the Lord, having extinguished their\nindividuality. Some of them, who are not situated even in the impersonal\nexistence, return to this material field to exhibit their dormant desires for\nactivities. They are not admitted in the spiritual planets, but they are again\ngiven a chance to act on the material planets. For those who are fruitive\nworkers, the Lord awards the desired results of their prescribed duties, as the\nyaj\u00f1e\u015bvara; and those who are yog\u012bs seeking mystic powers are awarded such\npowers. In other words, everyone is dependant for success upon His mercy alone,\nand all kinds of spiritual processes are but different degrees of success on the\nsame path. Unless, therefore, one comes to the highest perfection of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness, all attempts remain imperfect, as is stated in the \u015ar\u012bmad\nBh\u0101gavatam:\n\n\nak\u0101ma\u1e25 sarva-k\u0101mo v\u0101 mok\u1e63a-k\u0101ma ud\u0101radh\u012b\u1e25 t\u012bvre\u1e47a bhakti-yogena yajeta puru\u1e63a\u1e41\nparam\n\n\n\u201cWhether one is without desire [the condition of the devotees], or is desirous\nof all fruitive results, or is after liberation, one should with all efforts try\nto worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead for complete perfection,\nculminating in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 2.3.10)\n\n\n4.12\n\n\nk\u0101\u1e45k\u1e63anta\u1e25 karma\u1e47\u0101\u1e41 siddhi\u1e41\n\n\nyajanta iha devat\u0101\u1e25\n\n\nk\u1e63ipra\u1e41 hi m\u0101nu\u1e63e loke\n\n\nsiddhir bhavati karma-j\u0101\n\n\nk\u0101\u1e45k\u1e63anta\u1e25\u2014desiring; karma\u1e47\u0101m\u2014of fruitive activities; siddhim\u2014perfection;\nyajante\u2014worship by sacrifices; iha\u2014in the material world; devat\u0101\u1e25\u2014the demigods;\nk\u1e63ipram\u2014very quickly; hi\u2014certainly; m\u0101nu\u1e63e\u2014in human society; loke\u2014within this\nworld; siddhi\u1e25 bhavati\u2014becomes successful; karmaj\u0101\u2014the fruitive worker.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nMen in this world desire success in fruitive activities, and therefore they\nworship the demigods. Quickly, of course, men get results from fruitive work in\nthis world.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThere is a great misconception about the gods or demigods of this material\nworld, and men of less intelligence, although passing as great scholars, take\nthese demigods to be various forms of the Supreme Lord. Actually, the demigods\nare not different forms of God, but they are God\u2019s different parts and parcels.\nGod is one, and the parts and parcels are many. The Vedas say, nityo nity\u0101n\u0101m:\nGod is one. \u012a\u015bvara\u1e25 parama\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u1e25. The Supreme God is one\u2014K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2014and the\ndemigods are delegated with powers to manage this material world. These demigods\nare all living entities (nity\u0101n\u0101m) with different grades of material power. They\ncannot be equal to the Supreme God\u2014N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Anyone who thinks\nthat God and the demigods are on the same level is called an atheist, or\np\u0101\u1e63a\u1e47\u1e0d\u012b. Even the great demigods like Brahm\u0101 and \u015aiva cannot be compared to the\nSupreme Lord. In fact, the Lord is worshiped by demigods such as Brahm\u0101 and \u015aiva\n(\u015biva-viri\u00f1ci-nutam). Yet curiously enough there are many human leaders who are\nworshiped by foolish men under the misunderstanding of anthropomorphism or\nzoomorphism. Iha devat\u0101\u1e25 denotes a powerful man or demigod of this material\nworld. But N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, does\nnot belong to this world. He is above, or transcendental to, material creation.\nEven \u015ar\u012bp\u0101da \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101c\u0101rya, the leader of the impersonalists, maintains that\nN\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is beyond this material creation. However, foolish people\n(h\u1e5bt-a\u00f1jana) worship the demigods because they want immediate results. They get\nthe results, but do not know that results so obtained are temporary and are\nmeant for less intelligent persons. The intelligent person is in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness, and he has no need to worship the paltry demigods for some\nimmediate, temporary benefit. The demigods of this material world, as well as\ntheir worshipers, will vanish with the annihilation of this material world. The\nboons of the demigods are material and temporary. Both the material worlds and\ntheir inhabitants, including the demigods, and their worshipers, are bubbles in\nthe cosmic ocean. In this world, however, human society is mad after temporary\nthings such as the material opulence of possessing land, family and enjoyable\nparaphernalia. To achieve such temporary things, they worship the demigods or\npowerful men in human society. If a man gets some ministership in the government\nby worshiping a political leader, he considers that he has achieved a great\nboon. All of them are therefore kowtowing to the so-called leaders or \u201cbig guns\u201d\nin order to achieve temporary boons, and they indeed achieve such things. Such\nfoolish men are not interested in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness for the permanent solution\nto the hardships of material existence. They are all after sense enjoyment, and\nto get a little facility for sense enjoyment they are attracted to worship\nempowered living entities known as demigods. This verse indicates that people\nare rarely interested in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. They are mostly interested in\nmaterial enjoyment, and therefore they worship some powerful living entity.\n\n\n4.13\n\n\nc\u0101tur-var\u1e47ya\u1e41 may\u0101 s\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da\u1e41\n\n\ngu\u1e47a-karma-vibh\u0101ga\u015ba\u1e25\n\n\ntasya kart\u0101ram api m\u0101\u1e41\n\n\nviddhy akart\u0101ram avyayam\n\n\nc\u0101tur-var\u1e47yam\u2014the four divisions of human society; may\u0101\u2014by Me; s\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dam\u2014created;\ngu\u1e47a\u2014quality; karma\u2014work; vibh\u0101ga\u015ba\u1e25\u2014in terms of division; tasya\u2014of that;\nkart\u0101ram\u2014the father; api\u2014although; m\u0101m\u2014Me; viddhi\u2014you may know; akart\u0101ram\u2014as the\nnon-doer; avyayam\u2014being unchangeable.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nAccording to the three modes of material nature and the work ascribed to them,\nthe four divisions of human society were created by Me. And, although I am the\ncreator of this system, you should know that I am yet the non-doer, being\nunchangeable.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe Lord is the creator of everything. Everything is born of Him, everything is\nsustained by Him, and everything, after annihilation, rests in Him. He is\ntherefore the creator of the four divisions of the social order, beginning with\nthe intelligent class of men, technically called br\u0101hma\u1e47as due to their being\nsituated in the mode of goodness. Next is the administrative class, technically\ncalled the k\u1e63atriyas due to their being situated in the mode of passion. The\nmercantile men, called the vai\u015byas, are situated in the mixed modes of passion\nand ignorance, and the \u015b\u016bdras, or laborer class, are situated in the ignorant\nmode of material nature. In spite of His creating the four divisions of human\nsociety, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a does not belong to any of these divisions, because He is not\none of the conditioned souls, a section of whom form human society. Human\nsociety is similar to any other animal society, but to elevate men from the\nanimal status, the abovementioned divisions are created by the Lord for the\nsystematic development of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. The tendency of a particular man\ntoward work is determined by the modes of material nature which he has acquired.\nSuch symptoms of life, according to different modes of material nature, are\ndescribed in the Eighteenth Chapter of this book. A person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness, however, is above even the br\u0101hma\u1e47as, because a br\u0101hma\u1e47a by\nquality is supposed to know about Brahman, the Supreme Absolute Truth. Most of\nthem approach the impersonal Brahman manifestation of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but only a man\nwho transcends the limited knowledge of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a and reaches the knowledge of\nthe Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, becomes a person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness\u2014or, in other words, a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness includes\nknowledge of all different plenary expansions of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, namely R\u0101ma, N\u1e5bsi\u1e41ha,\nVar\u0101ha, etc. However, as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is transcendental to this system of the four\ndivisions of human society, a person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is also\ntranscendental to all divisions of human society, whether we consider the\ndivisions of community, nation or species.\n\n\n4.14\n\n\nna m\u0101\u1e41 karm\u0101\u1e47i limpanti\n\n\nna me karma-phale sp\u1e5bh\u0101\n\n\niti m\u0101\u1e41 yo \u2019bhij\u0101n\u0101ti\n\n\nkarmabhir na sa badhyate\n\n\nna\u2014never; m\u0101m\u2014unto Me; karm\u0101\u1e47i\u2014all kinds of work; limpanti\u2014do affect; na\u2014nor;\nme\u2014My; karma-phale\u2014in fruitive action; sp\u1e5bh\u0101\u2014aspiration; iti\u2014thus; m\u0101m\u2014unto Me;\nya\u1e25\u2014one who; abhij\u0101n\u0101ti\u2014does know; karmabhi\u1e25\u2014by the reaction of such work;\nna\u2014never does; sa\u1e25\u2014he; badhyate\u2014become entangled.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThere is no work that affects Me; nor do I aspire for the fruits of action. One\nwho understands this truth about Me also does not become entangled in the\nfruitive reactions of work.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nAs there are constitutional laws in the material world stating that the king can\ndo no wrong, or that the king is not subject to the state laws, similarly the\nLord, although He is the creator of this material world, is not affected by the\nactivities of the material world. He creates and remains aloof from the\ncreation, whereas the living entities are entangled in the fruitive results of\nmaterial activities because of their propensity for lording it over material\nresources. The proprietor of an establishment is not responsible for the right\nand wrong activities of the workers, but the workers are themselves responsible.\nThe living entities are engaged in their respective activities of sense\ngratification, and these activities are not ordained by the Lord. For\nadvancement of sense gratification, the living entities are engaged in the work\nof this world, and they aspire to heavenly happiness after death. The Lord,\nbeing full in Himself, has no attraction for so-called heavenly happiness. The\nheavenly demigods are only His engaged servants. The proprietor never desires\nthe low-grade happiness such as the workers may desire. He is aloof from the\nmaterial actions and reactions. For example, the rains are not responsible for\ndifferent types of vegetation that appear on the earth, although without such\nrains there is no possibility of vegetative growth. Vedic sm\u1e5bti confirms this\nfact as follows:\n\n\nnimitta-m\u0101tram ev\u0101sau s\u1e5bjy\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 sarga-karma\u1e47i pradh\u0101na-k\u0101ra\u1e47\u012b-bh\u016bt\u0101 yato vai\ns\u1e5bjya-\u015baktaya\u1e25.\n\n\nIn the material creations, the Lord is only the supreme cause. The immediate\ncause is material nature by which the cosmic manifestation is visible. The\ncreated beings are of many varieties, such as the demigods, human beings and\nlower animals, and all of them are subject to the reactions of their past good\nor bad activities. The Lord only gives them the proper facilities for such\nactivities and the regulations of the modes of nature, but He is never\nresponsible for their past and present activities. In the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btras it is\nconfirmed that the Lord is never partial to any living entity. The living entity\nis responsible for his own acts. The Lord only gives him facilities, through the\nagency of material nature, the external energy. Anyone who is fully conversant\nwith all the intricacies of this law of karma, or fruitive activities, does not\nbecome affected by the results of his activities. In other words, the person who\nunderstands this transcendental nature of the Lord is an experienced man in\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, and thus he is never subjected to the laws of karma. One\nwho does not know the transcendental nature of the Lord and who thinks that the\nactivities of the Lord are aimed at fruitive results, as are the activities of\nthe ordinary living entities, certainly becomes entangled himself in fruitive\nreaction. But one who knows the Supreme Truth is a liberated soul fixed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness.\n\n\n4.15\n\n\neva\u1e41 j\u00f1\u0101tv\u0101 k\u1e5bta\u1e41 karma\n\n\np\u016brvair api mumuk\u1e63ubhi\u1e25\n\n\nkuru karmaiva tasm\u0101t tva\u1e41\n\n\np\u016brvai\u1e25 p\u016brvatara\u1e41 k\u1e5btam\n\n\nevam\u2014thus; j\u00f1\u0101tv\u0101\u2014knowing well; k\u1e5btam\u2014performed; karma\u2014work; p\u016brvai\u1e25\u2014by past\nauthorities; api\u2014although; mumuk\u1e63ubhi\u1e25\u2014who attained liberation; kuru\u2014just\nperform; karma\u2014prescribed duty; eva\u2014certainly; tasm\u0101t\u2014therefore; tvam\u2014you;\np\u016brvai\u1e25\u2014by the predecessors; p\u016brvataram\u2014ancient predecessors; k\u1e5btam\u2014as\nperformed.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nAll the liberated souls in ancient times acted with this understanding and so\nattained liberation. Therefore, as the ancients, you should perform your duty in\nthis divine consciousness.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThere are two classes of men. Some of them are full of polluted material things\nwithin their hearts, and some of them are materially free. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness\nis equally beneficial for both of these persons. Those who are full of dirty\nthings can take to the line of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness for a gradual cleansing\nprocess, following the regulative principles of devotional service. Those who\nare already cleansed of the impurities may continue to act in the same K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness so that others may follow their exemplary activities and thereby\nbe benefitted. Foolish persons or neophytes in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness often want to\nretire from activities without having knowledge of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Arjuna\u2019s\ndesire to retire from activities on the battlefield was not approved by the\nLord. One need only know how to act. To retire from the activities of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness and to sit aloof making a show of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness; is less\nimportant than actually engaging in the field of activities for the sake of\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Arjuna is here advised to act in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, following in the\nfootsteps of the Lord\u2019s previous disciples, such as the sun-god Vivasv\u0101n, as\nmentioned hereinbefore. The Supreme Lord knows all His past activities, as well\nas those of persons who acted in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness in the past. Therefore He\nrecommends the acts of the sun-god, who learned this art from the Lord some\nmillions of years before. All such students of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are mentioned here as\npast liberated persons, engaged in the discharge of duties allotted by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\n\n\n4.16\n\n\nki\u1e41 karma kim akarmeti\n\n\nkavayo \u2019py atra mohit\u0101\u1e25\n\n\ntat te karma pravak\u1e63y\u0101mi\n\n\nyaj j\u00f1\u0101tv\u0101 mok\u1e63yase \u2019\u015bubh\u0101t\n\n\nkim\u2014what is; karma\u2014action; kim\u2014what is; akarma\u2014inaction; iti\u2014thus; kavaya\u1e25\u2014the\nintelligent; api\u2014also; atra\u2014in this matter; mohit\u0101\u1e25\u2014bewildered; tat\u2014that;\nte\u2014unto you; karma\u2014work; pravak\u1e63y\u0101mi\u2014I shall explain; yat\u2014which; j\u00f1\u0101tv\u0101\u2014knowing;\nmok\u1e63yase\u2014be liberated; a\u015bubh\u0101t\u2014from ill fortune.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nEven the intelligent are bewildered in determining what is action and what is\ninaction. Now I shall explain to you what action is, knowing which you shall be\nliberated from all sins.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nAction in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness has to be executed in accord with the examples of\nprevious bona fide devotees. This is recommended in the 15th verse. Why such\naction should not be independant will be explained in the text to follow.\n\n\nTo act in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, one has to follow the leadership of authorized\npersons who are in a line of disciplic succession as explained in the beginning\nof this chapter. The system of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness was first narrated to the\nsun-god, the sun-god explained it to his son Manu, Manu explained it to his son\nIk\u1e63v\u0101ku, and the system is current on this earth from that very remote time.\nTherefore, one has to follow in the footsteps of previous authorities in the\nline of disciplic succession. Otherwise even the most intelligent men will be\nbewildered regarding the standard actions of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. For this\nreason, the Lord decided to instruct Arjuna in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness directly.\nBecause of the direct instruction of the Lord to Arjuna, anyone who follows in\nthe footsteps of Arjuna is certainly not bewildered.\n\n\nIt is said that one cannot ascertain the ways of religion simply by imperfect\nexperimental knowledge. Actually, the principles of religion can only be laid\ndown by the Lord Himself. Dharma\u1e41 hi s\u0101k\u1e63\u0101t-bhagavat-pra\u1e47\u012btam. No one can\nmanufacture a religious principle by imperfect speculation. One must follow in\nthe footsteps of great authorities like Brahm\u0101, \u015aiva, N\u0101rada, Manu, Kum\u0101ra,\nKapila, Prahl\u0101da, Bh\u012b\u1e63ma, \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, Yamar\u0101ja, Janaka, etc. By mental\nspeculation one cannot ascertain what is religion or self-realization.\nTherefore, out of causeless mercy to His devotees, the Lord explains directly to\nArjuna what action is and what inaction is. Only action performed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness can deliver a person from the entanglement of material existence.\n\n\n4.17\n\n\nkarma\u1e47o hy api boddhavya\u1e41\n\n\nboddhavya\u1e41 ca vikarma\u1e47a\u1e25\n\n\nakarma\u1e47a\u015b ca boddhavya\u1e41\n\n\ngahan\u0101 karma\u1e47o gati\u1e25\n\n\nkarma\u1e47a\u1e25\u2014working order ; hi\u2014certainly; api\u2014also; boddhavyam\u2014should be\nunderstood; boddhavyam\u2014to be understood; ca\u2014also; vikarma\u1e47a\u1e25\u2014forbidden work;\nakarma\u1e47a\u1e25\u2014inaction; ca\u2014also; boddhavyam\u2014should be understood; gahan\u0101\u2014very\ndifficult; karma\u1e47a\u1e25\u2014working order; gati\u1e25\u2014to enter into.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThe intricacies of action are very hard to understand. Therefore one should know\nproperly what action is, what forbidden action is, and what inaction is.\n\n\nIf one is serious about liberation from material bondage, one has to understand\nthe distinctions between action, inaction and unauthorized actions. One has to\napply oneself to such an analysis of action, reaction and perverted actions\nbecause it is a very difficult subject matter. To understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness\nand action according to the modes, one has to learn one\u2019s relationship with the\nSupreme; i.e., one who has learned perfectly knows that every living entity is\nthe eternal servitor of the Lord and that consequently one has to act in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness. The entire Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is directed toward this conclusion. Any\nother conclusions, against this consciousness and its attendant reactions, are\nvikarmas, or prohibitive actions. To understand all this one has to associate\nwith authorities in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and learn the secret from them; this is\nas good as learning from the Lord directly. Otherwise, even the most intelligent\nperson will be bewildered.\n\n\n4.18\n\n\nkarma\u1e47y akarma ya\u1e25 pa\u015byed\n\n\nakarma\u1e47i ca karma ya\u1e25\n\n\nsa buddhim\u0101n manu\u1e63ye\u1e63u\n\n\nsa yukta\u1e25 k\u1e5btsna-karma-k\u1e5bt\n\n\nkarma\u1e47i\u2014in action; akarma\u2014inaction; ya\u1e25\u2014one who; pa\u015byet\u2014observes; akarma\u1e47i\u2014in\ninaction; ca\u2014also; karma\u2014fruitive action; ya\u1e25\u2014one who; sa\u1e25\u2014he; buddhim\u0101n\u2014is\nintelligent; manu\u1e63ye\u1e63u\u2014in human society; sa\u1e25\u2014he; yukta\u1e25\u2014is in the transcendental\nposition; k\u1e5btsna-karma-k\u1e5bt\u2014although engaged in all activities.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nOne who sees inaction in action, and action in inaction, is intelligent among\nmen, and he is in the tranecendental position, although engaged in all sorts of\nactivities.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nA person acting in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is naturally free from the bonds of\nkarma. His activities are all performed for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; therefore he does not enjoy\nor suffer any of the effects of work. Consequently he is intelligent in human\nsociety, even though he is engaged in all sorts of activities for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Akarma\nmeans without reaction to work. The impersonalist ceases fruitive activities out\nof fear, so that the resultant action may not be a stumbling block on the path\nof self-realization, but the personalist knows rightly his position as the\neternal servitor of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore he engages\nhimself in the activities of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Because everything is done for\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he enjoys only transcendental happiness in the discharge of this service.\nThose who are engaged in this process are known to be without desire for\npersonal sense gratification. The sense of eternal servitorship to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a makes\none immune to all sorts of reactionary elements of work.\n\n\n4.19\n\n\nyasya sarve sam\u0101rambh\u0101\u1e25\n\n\nk\u0101ma-sa\u1e45kalpa-varjit\u0101\u1e25\n\n\nj\u00f1\u0101n\u0101gni-dagdha-karm\u0101\u1e47a\u1e41\n\n\ntam \u0101hu\u1e25 pa\u1e47\u1e0dita\u1e41 budh\u0101\u1e25\n\n\nyasya\u2014one whose; sarve\u2014all sorts of; sam\u0101rambh\u0101\u1e25\u2014in all attempts; k\u0101ma\u2014desire\nfor sense gratification; sa\u1e45kalpa\u2014determination; varjit\u0101\u1e25\u2014are devoid of;\nj\u00f1\u0101na\u2014of perfect knowledge; \u0101gni\u2014fire; dagdha\u2014being burnt by; karm\u0101\u1e47am\u2014the\nperformer; tam\u2014him; \u0101hu\u1e25\u2014declare; pa\u1e47\u1e0ditam\u2014learned; budh\u0101\u1e25\u2014those who know.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nOne is understood to be in full knowledge whose every act is devoid of desire\nfor sense gratification.

He is not even attached to his\npersonal maintenance, for everything is left to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Nor is he anxious to\nsecure things, nor to protect things already in his possession. He does his duty\nto his best ability and leaves everything to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Such an unattached person is\nalways free from the resultant reactions of good and bad; it is as though he\nwere not doing anything. This is the sign of akarma, or actions without fruitive\nreactions. Any other action, therefore, devoid of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, is\nbinding upon the worker, and that is the real aspect of vikarma, as explained\nhereinbefore.\n\n\n4.21\n\n\nnir\u0101\u015b\u012br yata-citt\u0101tm\u0101\n\n\ntyakta-sarva-parigraha\u1e25\n\n\n\u015b\u0101r\u012bra\u1e41 kevala\u1e41 karma\n\n\nkurvan n\u0101pnoti kilbi\u1e63am\n\n\nnir\u0101\u015b\u012b\u1e25\u2014without desire for the results; yata\u2014controlled; citta-\u0101tm\u0101\u2014mind and\nintelligence; tyakta\u2014giving up; sarva\u2014all; parigraha\u1e25\u2014sense of proprietorship\nover all possessions; \u015b\u0101r\u012bram\u2014in keeping body and soul together; kevalam\u2014only;\nkarma\u2014work; kurvan\u2014doing so; na\u2014never; \u0101pnoti\u2014does not acquire; kilbi\u1e63am\u2014sinful\nreactions.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nSuch a man of understanding acts with mind and intelligence perfectly\ncontrolled, gives up all sense of proprietorship over his possessions and acts\nonly for the bare necessities of life. Thus working, he is not affected by\nsinful reactions.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nA K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person does not expect good or bad results in his activities.\nHis mind and intelligence are fully controlled. He knows that he is part and\nparcel of the Supreme, and therefore the part played by him, as a part and\nparcel of the whole, is not his by choice but is chosen for him by the Supreme\nand is done only through His agency. When the hand moves, it does not move out\nof its own accord, but by the endeavor of the whole body. A K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious\nperson is always dovetailed with the supreme desire, for he has no desire for\npersonal sense gratification. He moves exactly like a part of a machine. As a\nmachine part requires oiling and cleaning for maintenance, similarly, a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconscious man maintains himself by his work just to remain fit for action in the\ntranscendental loving service of the Lord. He is therefore immune to all the\nreactions of his endeavors. Like an animal, he has no proprietorship even over\nhis own body. A cruel proprietor of an animal sometimes kills the animal in his\npossession, yet the animal does not protest. Nor does it have any real\nindependence. A K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person, fully engaged in self-realization, has\nvery little time to falsely possess any material object. For maintaining body\nand soul, he does not require unfair means of accumulating money. He does not,\ntherefore, become contaminated by such material sins. He is free from all\nreactions to his actions.\n\n\n4.22\n\n\nyad\u1e5bcch\u0101-l\u0101bha-santu\u1e63\u1e6do\n\n\ndvandv\u0101t\u012bto vimatsara\u1e25\n\n\nsama\u1e25 siddh\u0101v asiddhau ca\n\n\nk\u1e5btv\u0101pi na nibadhyate\n\n\nyad\u1e5bcch\u0101\u2014out of its own accord; l\u0101bha\u2014gain; santu\u1e63\u1e6da\u1e25\u2014satisfied;\ndvandva\u2014duality; at\u012bta\u1e25\u2014surpassed; vimatsara\u1e25\u2014free from envy; sama\u1e25\u2014steady;\nsiddhau\u2014in success; asiddhau\u2014failure; ca\u2014also; k\u1e5btv\u0101\u2014doing; api\u2014although;\nna\u2014never; nibadhyate\u2014is affected.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nHe who is satisfied with gain which comes of its own accord, who is free from\nduality and does not envy, who is steady both in success and failure, is never\nentangled, although performing actions.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nA K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person does not make much endeavor even to maintain his body.\nHe is satisfied with gains which are obtained of their own accord. He neither\nbegs nor borrows, but he labors honestly as far as is in his power, and is\nsatisfied with whatever is obtained by his own honest labor. He is therefore\nindependant in his livelihood. He does not allow anyone\u2019s service to hamper his\nown service in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. However, for the service of the Lord he can\nparticipate in any kind of action without being disturbed by the duality of the\nmaterial world. The duality of the material world is felt in terms of heat and\ncold, or misery and happiness. A K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person is above duality because\nhe does not hesitate to act in any way for the satisfaction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.

Consequently, whatever he does,\nhe does for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who is the primeval Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Therefore, all his works are\ntechnically sacrifices because sacrifice involves satisfying the Supreme Person,\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.

There are various activities in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, and\nall of them will be described in the following verses. But, for the present,\njust the principle of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is described. A conditioned soul,\nentangled in material contamination, is sure to act in the material atmosphere,\nand yet he has to get out of such an environment. The process by which the\nconditioned soul can get out of the material atmosphere is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\nFor example, a patient who is suffering from a disorder of the bowels due to\noverindulgence in milk products is cured by another milk product, namely curds.\nThe materially absorbed conditioned soul can be cured by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness as\nset forth here in the G\u012bt\u0101. This process is generally known as yaj\u00f1a, or\nactivities (sacrifices) simply meant for the satisfaction of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The\nmore the activities of the material world are performed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness,\nor for Vi\u1e63\u1e47u only, the more the atmosphere becomes spiritualized by complete\nabsorption. Brahman means spiritual. The Lord is spiritual, and the rays of His\ntranscendental body are called brahmajyoti, His spiritual effulgence. Everything\nthat exists is situated in that brahmajyoti, but when the jyoti is covered by\nillusion (m\u0101y\u0101) or sense gratification, it is called material. This material\nveil can be removed at once by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness; thus the offering for the\nsake of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, the consuming agent of such an offering or\ncontribution; the process of consumption, the contributor, and the result\nare\u2014all combined together\u2014Brahman, or the Absolute Truth. The Absolute Truth\ncovered by m\u0101y\u0101 is called matter. Matter dovetailed for the cause of the\nAbsolute Truth regains its spiritual quality. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is the process\nof converting the illusory consciousness into Brahman, or the Supreme. When the\nmind is fully absorbed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, it is said to be in sam\u0101dhi, or\ntrance. Anything done in such transcendental consciousness is called yaj\u00f1a, or\nsacrifice for the Absolute. In that condition of spiritual consciousness, the\ncontributor, the contribution, the consumption, the performer or leader of the\nperformance, and the result or ultimate gain\u2014everything\u2014becomes one in the\nAbsolute, the Supreme Brahman. That is the method of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\n\n\n4.25\n\n\ndaivam ev\u0101pare yaj\u00f1a\u1e41\n\n\nyogina\u1e25 paryup\u0101sate\n\n\nbrahm\u0101gn\u0101v apare yaj\u00f1a\u1e41\n\n\nyaj\u00f1enaivopajuhvati\n\n\ndaivam\u2014in worshiping the demigods; eva\u2014like this; apare\u2014some; yaj\u00f1am\u2014sacrifices;\nyogina\u1e25\u2014the mystics; paryup\u0101sate\u2014worship perfectly; brahma\u2014the Absolute Truth;\nagnau\u2014in the fire of; apare\u2014others; yaj\u00f1am\u2014sacrifice; yaj\u00f1ena\u2014by sacrifice;\neva\u2014thus; upajuhvati\u2014worship.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nSome yog\u012bs perfectly worship the demigods by offering different sacrifices to\nthem, and some of them offer sacrffices in the fire of the Supreme Brahman.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nAs described above, a person engaged in discharging duties in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness is also called a perfect yog\u012b or a first-class mystic. But there\nare others also, who perform similar sacrifices in the worship of demigods, and\nstill others who sacrifice to the Supreme Brahman, or the impersonal feature of\nthe Supreme Lord. So there are different kinds of sacrifices in terms of\ndifferent categories. Such different categories of sacrifice by different types\nof performers only superficially demark varieties of sacrifice. Factual\nsacrifice means to satisfy the Supreme Lord, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, who is also known as Yaj\u00f1a.\nAll the different varieties of sacrifice can be placed within two primary\ndivisions: namely, sacrifice of worldly possessions and sacrifice in pursuit of\ntranscendental knowledge. Those who are in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness sacrifice all\nmaterial possessions for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord, while others, who\nwant some temporary material happiness, sacrifice their material possessions to\nsatisfy demigods such as Indra, the sun-god, etc. And others, who are\nimpersonalists, sacrifice their identity by merging into the existence of\nimpersonal Brahman. The demigods are powerful living entities appointed by the\nSupreme Lord for the maintenance and supervision of all material functions like\nthe heating, watering and lighting of the universe. Those who are interested in\nmaterial benefits worship the demigods by various sacrifices according to the\nVedic rituals. They are called bahv-\u012b\u015bvara-v\u0101d\u012b, or believers in many gods. But\nothers, who worship the impersonal feature of the Absolute Truth and regard the\nforms of the demigods as temporary, sacrifice their individual selves in the\nsupreme fire and thus end their individual existences by merging into the\nexistence of the Supreme. Such impersonalists spend their time in philosophical\nspeculation to understand the transcendental nature of the Supreme. In other\nwords, the fruitive workers sacrifice their material possessions for material\nenjoyment, whereas the impersonalist sacrifices his material designations with a\nview to merging into the existence of the Supreme. For the impersonalist, the\nfire altar of sacrifice is the Supreme Brahman, and the offering is the self\nbeing consumed by the fire of Brahman. The K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person, like Arjuna,\nhowever, sacrifices everything for the satisfaction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and thus all his\nmaterial possessions as well as his own self\u2014everything\u2014is sacrificed for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\nThus, he is the first-class yog\u012b; but he does not lose his individual existence.\n\n\n4.26\n\n\n\u015brotr\u0101d\u012bn\u012bndriy\u0101\u1e47y anye\n\n\nsa\u1e41yam\u0101gni\u1e63u juhvati\n\n\n\u015babd\u0101d\u012bn vi\u1e63ay\u0101n anya\n\n\nindriy\u0101gni\u1e63u juhvati\n\n\n\u015brotra \u0101d\u012bni\u2014hearing process; indriy\u0101\u1e47i\u2014senses; anye\u2014others; sa\u1e41yama\u2014of\nrestraint; agni\u1e63u\u2014in the fire; juhvati\u2014offers; \u015babda-\u0101d\u012bn\u2014sound vibration, etc.;\nvi\u1e63ay\u0101n\u2014objects of sense gratification; anye\u2014others: indriya\u2014of sense organs;\nagni\u1e63u\u2014in the fire; juhvati\u2014sacrifice.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nSome of them sacrifice the hearing process and the senses in the fire of the\ncontrolled mind, and others sacrifice the objects of the senses, such as sound,\nin the fire of sacrifice.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe four divisions of human life, namely the brahmac\u0101r\u012b, the g\u1e5bhastha, the\nv\u0101naprastha, and the sanny\u0101s\u012b, are all meant to help men become perfect yog\u012bs or\ntranscendentalists. Since human life is not meant for our enjoying sense\ngratification like the animals, the four orders of human life are so arranged\nthat one may become perfect in spiritual life. The brahmac\u0101r\u012bs, or students\nunder the care of a bona fide spiritual master, control the mind by abstaining\nfrom sense gratification. They are referred to in this verse as sacrificing the\nhearing process and the senses in the fire of the controlled mind. A brahmac\u0101r\u012b\nhears only words concerning K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness; hearing is the basic principle\nfor understanding, and therefore the pure brahmac\u0101r\u012b engages fully in harer\nn\u0101m\u0101nuk\u012brtanam\u2014chanting and hearing the glories of the Lord. He restrains\nhimself from the vibrations of material sounds, and his hearing is engaged in\nthe transcendental sound vibration of Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Similarly, the\nhouseholders, who have some license for sense gratification, perform such acts\nwith great restraint. Sex life, intoxication and meat eating are general\ntendencies of human society, but a regulated householder does not indulge in\nunrestricted sex life and other sense gratifications. Marriage on principles of\nreligious life is therefore current in all civilized human society because that\nis the way for restricted sex life. This restricted, unattached sex life is also\na kind of yaj\u00f1a because the restricted householder sacrifices his general\ntendency toward sense gratification for higher transcendental life.\n\n\n4.27\n\n\nsarv\u0101\u1e47\u012bndriya-karm\u0101\u1e47i\n\n\npr\u0101\u1e47a-karm\u0101\u1e47i c\u0101pare\n\n\n\u0101tma-sa\u1e41yama-yog\u0101gnau\n\n\njuhvati j\u00f1\u0101na-d\u012bpite\n\n\nsarv\u0101\u1e47i\u2014all; indriya\u2014senses; karm\u0101\u1e47i\u2014functions; pr\u0101\u1e47a-karm\u0101\u1e47i\u2014functions of the\nlife breath; ca\u2014also; apare\u2014others; \u0101tma-sa\u1e41yama\u2014controlling the mind;\nyoga\u2014linking process; agnau\u2014in the fire of; juhvati\u2014offers; j\u00f1\u0101na-d\u012bpite\u2014because\nof the urge for self-realization.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThose who are interested in self-realization, in terms of mind and sense\ncontrol, offer the functions of all the senses, as well as the vital force\n[breath], as oblations into the fire of the controlled mind.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe yoga system conceived by Pata\u00f1jali is referred to herein. In the Yoga-s\u016btra\nof Pata\u00f1jali, the soul is called pratyag-\u0101tm\u0101 and parag-\u0101tm\u0101. As long as the\nsoul is attached to sense enjoyment, it is called parag-\u0101tm\u0101. The soul is\nsubjected to the functions of ten kinds of air at work within the body, and this\nis perceived through the breathing system. The P\u0101ta\u00f1jala system of yoga\ninstructs one on how to control the functions of the body\u2019s air in a technical\nmanner so that ultimately all the functions of the air within become favorable\nfor purifying the soul of material attachment. According to this yoga system,\npratyag \u0101tm\u0101 is the ultimate goal. This pratyag \u0101tm\u0101 is a withdrawal from\nactivities in matter. The senses interact with the sense objects, like the ear\nfor hearing, eyes for seeing, nose for smelling, tongue for tasting, hand for\ntouching, and all of them are thus engaged in activities outside the self. They\nare called the functions of the pr\u0101\u1e47a-v\u0101yu. The ap\u0101na-v\u0101yu goes downwards,\nvy\u0101na-v\u0101yu acts to shrink and expand, sam\u0101na-v\u0101yu adjusts equilibrium,\nud\u0101na-v\u0101yu goes upwards\u2014and when one is enlightened, one engages all these in\nsearching for self-realization.\n\n\n4.28\n\n\ndravya-yaj\u00f1\u0101s tapo-yaj\u00f1\u0101\n\n\nyoga-yaj\u00f1\u0101s tath\u0101pare\n\n\nsv\u0101dhy\u0101ya-j\u00f1\u0101na-yaj\u00f1\u0101\u015b ca\n\n\nyataya\u1e25 sa\u1e41\u015bita-vrat\u0101\u1e25\n\n\ndravya-yaj\u00f1\u0101\u1e25\u2014sacrificing one\u2019s possessions; tapo-yaj\u00f1\u0101\u1e25\u2014sacrifice in\nausterities; yoga-yaj\u00f1\u0101\u1e25\u2014sacrifice in eightfold mysticism; tath\u0101\u2014thus;\napare\u2014others; sv\u0101dhy\u0101ya\u2014sacrifice in the study of the Vedas;\nj\u00f1\u0101na-yaj\u00f1\u0101\u1e25\u2014sacrifice in advancement of transcendental knowledge; ca\u2014also;\nyataya\u1e25\u2014enlightened; sa\u1e41\u015bita\u2014taken to strict; vrat\u0101\u1e25\u2014vows.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThere are others who, enlightened by sacrificing their material possessions in\nsevere austerities, take strict vows and practice the yoga of eightfold\nmysticism, and others study the Vedas for the advancement of transcendental\nknowledge.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThese sacrifices may be fitted into various divisions. There are persons who are\nsacrificing their possessions in the form of various kinds of charities. In\nIndia, the rich mercantile community or princely orders open various kinds of\ncharitable institutions like dharma\u015b\u0101l\u0101, anna-k\u1e63etra, atithi-\u015b\u0101l\u0101, anathalaya,\nvidy\u0101p\u012b\u1e6dha, etc. In other countries, too, there are many hospitals, old age\nhomes and similar charitable foundations meant for distributing food, education\nand medical treatment free to the poor. All these charitable activities are\ncalled dravyamaya-yaj\u00f1a. There are others who, for higher elevation in life or\nfor promotion to higher planets within the universe, voluntarily accept many\nkinds of austerities such as candr\u0101yana and c\u0101turm\u0101sya. These processes entail\nsevere vows for conducting life under certain rigid rules. For example, under\nthe c\u0101turm\u0101sya vow the candidate does not shave for four months during the year\n(July to October), he does not eat certain foods, does not eat twice in a day\nand does not leave home. Such sacrifice of the comforts of life is called\ntapomaya-yaj\u00f1a. There are still others who engage themselves in different kinds\nof mystic yogas like the Pata\u00f1jali system (for merging into the existence of the\nAbsolute), or ha\u1e6dha-yoga or a\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45ga-yoga (for particular perfections). And some\ntravel to all the sanctified places of pilgrimage. All these practices are\ncalled yoga-yaj\u00f1a, sacrifice for a certain type of perfection in the material\nworld. There are others who engage themselves in the studies of different Vedic\nliteratures, specifically the Upani\u1e63ads and Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btras, or the s\u0101\u1e45khya\nphilosophy. All of these are called sv\u0101dhy\u0101ya-yaj\u00f1a, or engagement in the\nsacrifice of studies. All these yog\u012bs are faithfully engaged in different types\nof sacrifice and are seeking a higher status of life. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, is,\nhowever, different from these because it is the direct service of the Supreme\nLord. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness cannot be attained by any one of the above-mentioned\ntypes of sacrifices but can be attained only by the mercy of the Lord and His\nbona fide devotee. Therefore, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is transcendental.\n\n\n4.29\n\n\nap\u0101ne juhvati pr\u0101\u1e47a\u1e41\n\n\npr\u0101\u1e47e \u2019p\u0101na\u1e41 tath\u0101pare\n\n\npr\u0101\u1e47\u0101p\u0101na-gat\u012b ruddhv\u0101\n\n\npr\u0101\u1e47\u0101y\u0101ma-par\u0101ya\u1e47\u0101\u1e25\n\n\napare niyat\u0101h\u0101r\u0101\u1e25\n\n\npr\u0101\u1e47\u0101n pr\u0101\u1e47e\u1e63u juhvati\n\n\nap\u0101ne\u2014air which acts downward; juhvati\u2014offers; pr\u0101\u1e47am\u2014air which acts outward;\npr\u0101\u1e47e\u2014in the air going outward; ap\u0101nam\u2014air going downward; tath\u0101\u2014as also;\napare\u2014others; pr\u0101\u1e47a\u2014air going outward; ap\u0101na\u2014air going downward; gat\u012b\u2014movement;\nruddhv\u0101\u2014checking; pr\u0101\u1e47\u0101y\u0101ma\u2014trance induced by stopping all breathing;\npar\u0101ya\u1e47\u0101\u1e25\u2014so inclined; apare\u2014others; niyata\u2014controlled; \u0101h\u0101r\u0101\u1e25\u2014eating;\npr\u0101\u1e47\u0101n\u2014outgoing air; pr\u0101\u1e47e\u1e63u\u2014in the outgoing air; juhvati\u2014sacrifices.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nAnd there are even others who are inclined to the process of breath restraint to\nremain in trance, and they practice stopping the movement of the outgoing breath\ninto the incoming, and incoming breath into the outgoing, and thus at last\nremain in trance, stopping all breathing. Some of them, curtailing the eating\nprocess, offer the outgoing breath into itself, as a sacrifice.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThis system of yoga for controlling the breathing process is called pr\u0101\u1e47\u0101y\u0101ma,\nand in the beginning it is practiced in the ha\u1e6dha-yoga system through different\nsitting postures. All of these processes are recommended for controlling the\nsenses and for advancement in spiritual realization. This practice involves\ncontrolling the air within the body to enable simultaneous passage in opposite\ndirections. The ap\u0101na air goes downward, and the pr\u0101\u1e47a air goes up. The\npr\u0101\u1e47\u0101y\u0101ma yog\u012b practices breathing the opposite way until the currents are\nneutralized into p\u016braka, equilibrium. Similarly, when the exhaled breathing is\noffered to inhaled breathing, it is called recaka. When both air currents are\ncompletely stopped, it is called kumbhaka-yoga. By practice of kumbhaka-yoga,\nthe yog\u012bs increase the duration of life by many, many years. A K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious\nperson, however, being always situated in the transcendental loving service of\nthe Lord, automatically becomes the controller of the senses. His senses, being\nalways engaged in the service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, have no chance of becoming otherwise\nengaged. So at the end of life, he is naturally transferred to the\ntranscendental plane of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; consequently he makes no attempt to increase\nhis longevity. He is at once raised to the platform of liberation. A K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconscious person begins from the transcendental stage, and he is constantly in\nthat consciousness. Therefore, there is no falling down, and ultimately he\nenters into the abode of the Lord without delay. The practice of reduced eating\nis automatically done when one eats only K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a pras\u0101dam, or food which is\noffered first to the Lord. Reducing the eating process is very helpful in the\nmatter of sense control. And without sense control there is no possibility of\ngetting out of the material entanglement.\n\n\n4.30\n\n\nsarve \u2019py ete yaj\u00f1a-vido\n\n\nyaj\u00f1a-k\u1e63apita-kalma\u1e63\u0101\u1e25\n\n\nyaj\u00f1a-\u015bi\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101m\u1e5bta-bhujo\n\n\ny\u0101nti brahma san\u0101tanam\n\n\nsarve\u2014all; api\u2014although apparently different; ete\u2014all these;\nyaj\u00f1a-vida\u1e25\u2014conversant with the purpose of performing; yaj\u00f1a\u2014sacrifices;\nk\u1e63apita\u2014being cleansed of the result of such performances; kalma\u1e63\u0101\u1e25\u2014sinful\nreactions; yaj\u00f1a-\u015bi\u1e63\u1e6da\u2014as a result of such performances of yaj\u00f1a;\nam\u1e5bta-bhuja\u1e25\u2014those who have tasted such nectar; y\u0101nti\u2014do approach; brahma\u2014the\nsupreme; san\u0101tanam\u2014eternal atmosphere.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nAll these performers who know the meaning of sacrifice become cleansed of sinful\nreaction, and, having tasted the nectar of the remnants of such sacrifice, they\ngo to the supreme eternal atmosphere.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nFrom the foregoing explanation of differents types of sacrifice (namely\nsacrifice of one\u2019s possessions, study of the Vedas or philosophical doctrines,\nand performance of the yoga system), it is found that the common aim of all is\nto control the senses. Sense gratification is the root cause of material\nexistence; therefore, unless and until one is situated on a platform apart from\nsense gratification, there is no chance of being elevated to the eternal\nplatform of full knowledge, full bliss and full life. This platform is in the\neternal atmosphere, or Brahman atmosphere. All the above-mentioned sacrifices\nhelp one to become cleansed of the sinful reactions of material existence. By\nthis advancement in life, one not only becomes happy and opulent in this life,\nbut also, at the end, he enters into the eternal kingdom of God, either merging\ninto the impersonal Brahman or associating with the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\n\n\n4.31\n\n\nn\u0101ya\u1e41 loko \u2019sty ayaj\u00f1asya\n\n\nkuto \u2019nya\u1e25 kuru-sattama\n\n\nna\u2014never; ayam\u2014this; loka\u1e25\u2014planet; asti\u2014there is; ayaj\u00f1asya\u2014of the foolish;\nkuta\u1e25\u2014where is; anya\u1e25\u2014the other; kuru-sattama\u2014O best amongst the Kurus.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nO best of the Kuru dynasty, without sacrifice one can never live happily on this\nplanet or in this life: what then of the next?\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nWhatever form of material existence one is in, one is invariably ignorant of his\nreal situation. In other words, existence in the material world is due to the\nmultiple reactions to our sinful lives. Ignorance is the cause of sinful life,\nand sinful life is the cause of one\u2019s dragging on in material existence. The\nhuman form of life is the only loophole by which one may get out of this\nentanglement. The Vedas, therefore, give us a chance for escape by pointing out\nthe paths of religion, economic comfort, regulated sense gratification and, at\nlast, the means to get out of the miserable condition entirely. The path of\nreligion, or the different kinds of sacrifice recommended above, automatically\nsolves our economic problems. By performance of yaj\u00f1a we can have enough food,\nenough milk, etc.\u2014even if there is a so-called increase of population. When the\nbody is fully supplied, naturally the next stage is to satisfy the senses. The\nVedas prescribe, therefore, sacred marriage for regulated sense gratification.\nThereby one is gradually elevated to the platform of release from material\nbondage, and the highest perfection of liberated life is to associate with the\nSupreme Lord. Perfection is achieved by performance of yaj\u00f1a (sacrifice), as\ndescribed above. Now, if a person is not inclined to perform yaj\u00f1a according to\nthe Vedas, how can he expect a happy life? There are different grades of\nmaterial comforts in different heavenly planets, and in all cases there is\nimmense happiness for persons engaged in different kinds of yaj\u00f1a. But the\nhighest kind of happiness that a man can achieve is to be promoted to the\nspiritual planets by practice of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. A life of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness is therefore the solution to all the problems of material\nexistence.\n\n\n4.32\n\n\neva\u1e41 bahu-vidh\u0101 yaj\u00f1\u0101\n\n\nvitat\u0101 brahma\u1e47o mukhe\n\n\nkarma-j\u0101n viddhi t\u0101n sarv\u0101n\n\n\neva\u1e41 j\u00f1\u0101tv\u0101 vimok\u1e63yase\n\n\nevam\u2014thus; bahu-vidh\u0101\u1e25\u2014various kinds of; yaj\u00f1\u0101\u1e25\u2014sacrifices; vitat\u0101\u1e25\u2014widespread;\nbrahma\u1e47a\u1e25\u2014of the Vedas; mukhe\u2014in the face of; karma-j\u0101n\u2014born of work; viddhi\u2014you\nshould know; t\u0101n\u2014them; sarv\u0101n\u2014all; evam\u2014thus; j\u00f1\u0101tv\u0101\u2014knowing; vimok\u1e63yase\u2014be\nliberated.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nAll these different types of sacrifice are approved by the Vedas, and all of\nthem are born of different types of work. Knowing them as such, you will become\nliberated.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nDifferent types of sacrifice, as discussed above, are mentioned in the Vedas to\nsuit the different types of worker. Because men are so deeply absorbed in the\nbodily concept, these sacrifices are so arranged that one can work either with\nthe body, the mind, or the intelligence. But all of them are recommended for\nultimately bringing about liberation from the body. This is confirmed by the\nLord herewith from His own mouth.\n\n\n4.33\n\n\n\u015brey\u0101n dravya-may\u0101d yaj\u00f1\u0101j\n\n\nj\u00f1\u0101na-yaj\u00f1a\u1e25 parantapa\n\n\nsarva\u1e41 karm\u0101khila\u1e41 p\u0101rtha\n\n\nj\u00f1\u0101ne parisam\u0101pyate\n\n\n\u015brey\u0101n\u2014greater; dravyamay\u0101t\u2014than the sacrifice of material possessions;\nyaj\u00f1\u0101t\u2014knowledge; j\u00f1\u0101na-yaj\u00f1a\u1e25\u2014sacrifice in knowledge; parantapa\u2014O chastiser of\nthe enemy; sarvam\u2014all; karma\u2014activities; akhilam\u2014in totality; p\u0101rtha\u2014O son of\nP\u1e5bth\u0101; j\u00f1\u0101ne\u2014in knowledge; parisam\u0101pyate\u2014ends in.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nO chastiser of the enemy, the sacrifice of knowledge is greater than the\nsacrifice of material possessions. O son of P\u1e5bth\u0101, after all, the sacrifice of\nwork culminates in transcendental knowledge.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe purpose of all sacrifices is to arrive at the status of complete knowledge,\nthen to gain release from material miseries, and, ultimately, to engage in\nloving transcendental service to the Supreme Lord (K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness).\nNonetheless, there is a mystery about all these different activities of\nsacrifice, and one should know this mystery. Sacrifices sometimes take different\nforms according to the particular faith of the performer. When one\u2019s faith\nreaches the stage of transcendental knowledge, the performer of sacrifices\nshould be considered more advanced than those who simply sacrifice material\npossessions without such knowledge, for without attainment of knowledge,\nsacrifices remain on the material platform and bestow no spiritual benefit. Real\nknowledge culminates in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, the highest stage of transcendental\nknowledge. Without the elevation of knowledge, sacrifices are simply material\nactivities. When, however, they are elevated to the level of transcendental\nknowledge, all such activities enter onto the spiritual platform. Depending on\ndifferences in consciousness, sacrificial activities are sometimes called\nkarma-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da, fruitive activities, and sometimes j\u00f1\u0101na-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da, knowledge in the\npursuit of truth. It is better when the end is knowledge.\n\n\n4.34\n\n\ntad viddhi pra\u1e47ip\u0101tena\n\n\nparipra\u015bnena sevay\u0101\n\n\nupadek\u1e63yanti te j\u00f1\u0101na\u1e41\n\n\nj\u00f1\u0101ninas tattva-dar\u015bina\u1e25\n\n\ntat\u2014that knowledge of different sacrifices; viddhi\u2014try to understand;\npra\u1e47ip\u0101tena\u2014by approaching a spiritual master; paripra\u015bnena\u2014by submissive\ninquiries; sevay\u0101\u2014by the rendering of service; upadek\u1e63yanti\u2014initiate; te\u2014unto\nyou; j\u00f1\u0101nam\u2014knowledge; j\u00f1\u0101nina\u1e25\u2014the self-realized; tattva\u2014truth; dar\u015bina\u1e25\u2014the\nseers.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nJust try to learn the truth by approaching a spiritual master. Inquire from him\nsubmissively and render service unto him. The self-realized soul can impart\nknowledge unto you because he has seen the truth.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe path of spiritual realization is undoubtedly difficult. The Lord therefore\nadvises us to approach a bona fide spiritual master in the line of disciplic\nsuccession from the Lord Himself. No one can be a bona fide spiritual master\nwithout following this principle of disciplic succession. The Lord is the\noriginal spiritual master, and a person in the disciplic succession can convey\nthe message of the Lord as it is to his disciple. No one can be spiritually\nrealized by manufacturing his own process, as is the fashion of the foolish\npretenders. The Bh\u0101gavatam says: dharma\u1e41 hi s\u0101k\u1e63\u0101d-bhagavat-pra\u1e47\u012btam\u2014the path of\nreligion is directly enunciated by the Lord. Therefore, mental speculation or\ndry arguments cannot help one progress in spiritual life. One has to approach a\nbona fide spiritual master to receive the knowledge. Such a spiritual master\nshould be accepted in full surrender, and one should serve the spiritual master\nlike a menial servant, without false prestige. Satisfaction of the self-realized\nspiritual master is the secret of advancement in spiritual life. Inquiries and\nsubmission constitute the proper combination for spiritual understanding. Unless\nthere is submission and service, inquiries from the learned spiritual master\nwill not be effective. One must be able to pass the test of the spiritual\nmaster, and when he sees the genuine desire of the disciple, he automatically\nblesses the disciple with genuine spiritual understanding. In this verse, both\nblind following and absurd inquiries are condemned. One should not only hear\nsubmissively from the spiritual master; but one must also get a clear\nunderstanding from him, in submission and service and inquiries. A bona fide\nspiritual master is by nature very kind toward the disciple. Therefore when the\nstudent is submissive and is always ready to render service, the reciprocation\nof knowledge and inquiries becomes perfect.\n\n\n4.35\n\n\nyaj j\u00f1\u0101tv\u0101 na punar moham\n\n\neva\u1e41 y\u0101syasi p\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dava\n\n\nyena bh\u016bt\u0101ny a\u015be\u1e63\u0101\u1e47i\n\n\ndrak\u1e63yasy \u0101tmany atho mayi\n\n\nyat\u2014which; j\u00f1\u0101tv\u0101\u2014knowing; na\u2014never; puna\u1e25\u2014again; moham\u2014illusion; evam\u2014like\nthis; y\u0101syasi\u2014you shall go; p\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dava\u2014O son of P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du; yena\u2014by which; bh\u016bt\u0101ni\u2014all\nliving entities; a\u015bes\u0101\u1e47i\u2014totally; drak\u1e63yasi\u2014you will see; \u0101tmani\u2014in the Supreme\nSoul; atho\u2014or in other words; mayi\u2014in Me.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nAnd when you have thus learned the truth, you will know that all living beings\nare but part of Me\u2014and that they are in Me, and are Mine.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe result of receiving knowledge from a self-realized soul, or one who knows\nthings as they are, is learning that all living beings are parts and parcels of\nthe Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The sense of a separated\nexistence from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is called m\u0101y\u0101 (m\u0101\u2014not, y\u0101\u2014this). Some think that we have\nnothing to do with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is only a great historical personality and\nthat the Absolute is the impersonal Brahman. Factually, as it is stated in the\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, this impersonal Brahman is the personal effulgence of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the cause of everything. In the\nBrahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 it is clearly stated that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead, the cause of all causes. Even the millions of incarnations are only His\ndifferent expansions. Similarly, the living entities are also expansions of\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophers wrongly think that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a loses His own separate\nexistence in His many expansions. This thought is material in nature. We have\nexperience in the material world that a thing, when fragmentally distributed,\nloses its own original identity. But the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophers fail to\nunderstand that Absolute means that one plus one is equal to one, and that one\nminus one is also equal to one. This is the case in the absolute world.\n\n\nFor want of sufficient knowledge in the absolute science, we are now covered\nwith illusion, and therefore we think that we are separate from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Although\nwe are separated parts of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, we are nevertheless not different from Him. The\nbodily difference of the living entities is m\u0101y\u0101, or not actual fact. We are all\nmeant to satisfy K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. By m\u0101y\u0101 alone Arjuna thought that the temporary bodily\nrelationship with his kinsmen was more important than his eternal spiritual\nrelationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The whole teaching of the G\u012bt\u0101 is targetted toward this\nend: that a living being, as His eternal servitor, cannot be separated from\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and his sense of being an identity apart from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is called m\u0101y\u0101. The\nliving entities, as separate parts and parcels of the Supreme, have a purpose to\nfulfill. Having forgotten that purpose, since time immemorial they are situated\nin different bodies, as men, animals, demigods, etc. Such bodily differences\narise from forgetfulness of the transcendental service of the Lord. But when one\nis engaged in transcendental service through K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, one becomes at\nonce liberated from this illusion. One can acquire such pure knowledge only from\nthe bona fide spiritual master and thereby avoid the delusion that the living\nentity is equal to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Perfect knowledge is that the Supreme Soul, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is\nthe supreme shelter for all living entities, and giving up such shelter, the\nliving entities are deluded by the material energy, imagining themselves to have\na separate identity. Thus, under different standards of material identity, they\nbecome forgetful of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. When, however, such deluded living entities become\nsituated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, it is to be understood that they are on the\npath of liberation, as confirmed in the Bh\u0101gavatam: muktir hitv\u0101nyath\u0101 r\u016bpa\u1e41\nsvar\u016bpe\u1e47a vyavasthiti\u1e25.

This material world is sometimes regarded as\nan ocean of nescience and sometimes as a blazing forest. In the ocean, however\nexpert a swimmer one may be, the struggle for existence is very severe. If\nsomeone comes forward and lifts the struggling swimmer from the ocean, he is the\ngreatest savior. Perfect knowledge, received from the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead, is the path of liberation.

Persons who are almost like animals have no faith in, or knowledge of,\nthe standard revealed scriptures; and some, even though they have knowledge of,\nor can cite passages from, the revealed scriptures, have actually no faith in\nthese words. And even though others may have faith in scriptures like\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, they do not believe in or worship the Personality of Godhead, \u015ar\u012b\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Such persons cannot have any standing in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. They fall\ndown. Out of all the abovementioned persons, those who have no faith and are\nalways doubtful make no progress at all. Men without faith in God and His\nrevealed word find no good in this world, nor in the next. For them there is no\nhappiness whatsoever. One should therefore follow the principles of revealed\nscriptures with faith and thereby be raised to the platform of knowledge. Only\nthis knowledge will help one become promoted to the transcendental platform of\nspiritual understanding. In other words, doubtful persons have no status\nwhatsoever in spiritual emancipation.

Armed with yoga, O Bh\u0101rata, stand and fight.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe yoga system instructed in this chapter is called san\u0101tana-yoga, or eternal\nactivities performed by the living entity. This yoga has two divisions of\nsacrificial actions: one is called sacrifice of one\u2019s material possessions, and\nthe other is called knowledge of self, which is pure spiritual activity. If\nsacrifice of one\u2019s material possessions is not dovetailed for spiritual\nrealization, then such sacrifice becomes material. But one who performs such\nsacrifices with a spiritual objective, or in devotional service, makes a perfect\nsacrifice. When we come to spiritual activities, we find that these are also\ndivided into two: namely, understanding of one\u2019s own self (or one\u2019s\nconstitutional position), and the truth regarding the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead. One who follows the path of the G\u012bt\u0101 as it is can very easily\nunderstand these two important divisions of spiritual knowledge. For him there\nis no difficulty in obtaining perfect knowledge of the self as part and parcel\nof the Lord. And such understanding is beneficial for such a person who easily\nunderstands the transcendental activities of the Lord. In the beginning of this\nchapter, the transcendental activities of the Lord were discussed by the Supreme\nLord Himself. One who does not understand the instructions of the G\u012bt\u0101 is\nfaithless, and is to be considered to be misusing the fragmental independence\nawarded to him by the Lord. In spite of such instructions, one who does not\nunderstand the real nature of the Lord as the eternal, blissful, all-knowing\nPersonality of Godhead, is certainly fool number one. Ignorance can be removed\nby gradual acceptance of the principles of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness is awakened by different types of sacrifices to the demigods,\nsacrifice to Brahman, sacrifice in celibacy, in household life, in controlling\nthe senses, in practicing mystic yoga, in penance, in foregoing material\npossessions, in studying the Vedas, and in partaking of the social institution\ncalled var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma. All of these are known as sacrifice, and all of them\nare based on regulated action. But within all these activities, the important\nfactor is self-realization. One who seeks that objective is the real student of\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, but one who doubts the authority of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a falls back. One is\ntherefore advised to study Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, or any other scripture, under a bona\nfide spiritual master, with service and surrender. A bona fide spiritual master\nis in the disciplic succession from time eternal, and he does not deviate at all\nfrom the instructions of the Supreme Lord as they were imparted millions of\nyears ago to the sun-god, from whom the instructions of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 have come\ndown to the earthly kingdom. One should, therefore, follow the path of\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 as it is expressed in the G\u012bt\u0101 itself and beware of\nself-interested people after personal aggrandizement who deviate others from the\nactual path. The Lord is definitely the supreme person, and His activities are\ntranscendental. One who understands this is a liberated person from the very\nbeginning of his study of the G\u012bt\u0101.\nKarma-yoga\u2014Action in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Consciousness",

PURPORT  Herein we find the history of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 traced from a remote time when\nit was delivered to the royal order, the kings of all planets. This science is\nespecially meant for the protection of the inhabitants and therefore the royal\norder should understand it in order to be able to rule the citizens and protect\nthem from the material bondage to lust. Human life is meant for cultivation of\nspiritual knowledge, in eternal relationship with the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead, and the executive heads of all states and all planets are obliged to\nimpart this lesson to the citizens by education, culture and devotion. In other\nwords, the executive heads of all states are intended to spread the science of\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness so that the people may take advantage of this great science\nand pursue a successful path, utilizing the opportunity of the human form of\nlife.  In this millennium, the sun-god is known as Vivasv\u0101n, the king of the sun, which\nis the origin of all planets within the solar system. In the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 [Bs.\n5.52] it is stated:  yac-cak\u1e63ur e\u1e63a savit\u0101 sakala-grah\u0101\u1e47\u0101\u1e41 r\u0101j\u0101 samasta-sura-m\u016brttir a\u015be\u1e63a-tej\u0101\u1e25\nyasy\u0101j\u00f1ay\u0101 bhramati sambh\u1e5bta-k\u0101lacakro govindam \u0101di-puru\u1e63a\u1e41 tam aha\u1e41 bhaj\u0101mi  \u201cLet me worship,\u201d Lord Brahm\u0101 said, \u201cthe Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda\n[K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a], who is the original person and under whose order the sun, which is the\nking of all planets, is assuming immense power and heat. The sun represents the\neye of the Lord and traverses its orbit in obedience to His order.\u201d  The sun is the king of the planets, and the sun-god (at present of the name\nVivasv\u0101n) rules the sun planet, which is controlling all other planets by\nsupplying heat and light. He is rotating under the order of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and Lord\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a originally made Vivasv\u0101n His first disciple to understand the science of\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. The G\u012bt\u0101 is not, therefore, a speculative treatise for the\ninsignificant mundane scholar but is a standard book of knowledge coming down\nfrom time immemorial. In the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata (\u015a\u0101nti-parva 348.51\u201352) we can trace\nout the history of the G\u012bt\u0101 as follows:  tret\u0101-yug\u0101dau ca tato vivasv\u0101n manave dadau manu\u015b ca loka-bh\u1e5bty-artha\u1e41\nsut\u0101yek\u1e63v\u0101kave dadau ik\u1e63v\u0101ku\u1e47\u0101 ca kathito vy\u0101pya lok\u0101n avasthit\u0101\u1e25  \u201cIn the beginning of the Tret\u0101-yuga [millennium] this science of the\nrelationship with the Supreme was delivered by Vivasv\u0101n to Manu. Manu, being the\nfather of mankind, gave it to his son Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Ik\u1e63v\u0101ku, the King of this earth\nplanet and forefather of the Raghu dynasty in which Lord R\u0101macandra appeared.\nTherefore, Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 existed in the human society from the time of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja\nIk\u1e63v\u0101ku.\u201d  At the present moment we have just passed through five thousand years of the\nKali-yuga, which lasts 432,000 years. Before this there was Dv\u0101para-yuga\n(800,000 years), and before that there was Tret\u0101-yuga (1,200,000 years). Thus,\nsome 2,005,000 years ago, Manu spoke the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 to his disciple and son\nMah\u0101r\u0101ja lk\u1e63v\u0101ku, the King of this planet earth. The age of the current Manu is\ncalculated to last some 305,300,000 years, of which 120,400,000 have passed.\nAccepting that before the birth of Manu, the G\u012bt\u0101 was spoken by the Lord to His\ndisciple, the sun-god Vivasv\u0101n, a rough estimate is that the G\u012bt\u0101 was spoken at\nleast 120,400,000 years ago; and in human society it has been extant for two\nmillion years. It was respoken by the Lord again to Arjuna about five thousand\nyears ago. That is the rough estimate of the history of the G\u012bta, according to\nthe G\u012bt\u0101 itself and according to the version of the speaker, Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.

Because Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is as good as the Vedas, being spoken by the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead, this knowledge is apauru\u1e63eya, superhuman.

As soon as the original purpose was scattered by\nthe motives of the unscrupulous commentators, there arose the need to\nreestablish the disciplic succession. Five thousand years ago it was detected by\nthe Lord Himself that the disciplic succession was broken, and therefore He\ndeclared that the purpose of the G\u012bt\u0101 appeared to be lost. In the same way, at\nthe present moment also there are so many editions of the G\u012bt\u0101 (especially in\nEnglish), but almost all of them are not according to authorized disciplic\nsuccession.

TRANSLATION  Arjuna said: The sun-god Vivasv\u0101n is senior by birth to You. How am I to\nunderstand that in the beginning You instructed this science to him?  PURPORT  Arjuna is an accepted devotee of the Lord, so how could he not believe K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s\nwords? The fact is that Arjuna is not inquiring for himself but for those who do\nnot believe in the Supreme Personality of Godhead or for the demons who do not\nlike the idea that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a should be accepted as the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead; for them only Arjuna inquires on this point, as if he were himself not\naware of the Personality of Godhead, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. As it will be evident from the\nTenth Chapter, Arjuna knew perfectly well that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality\nof Godhead, the fountainhead of everything and the last word in Transcendence.\nOf course, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a also appeared as the son of Devak\u012b on this earth. How K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nremained the same Supreme Personality of Godhead, the eternal, original person,\nis very difficult for an ordinary man to understand. Therefore, to clarify this\npoint, Arjuna put this question before K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a so that He Himself could speak\nauthoritatively. That K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the supreme authority is accepted by the whole\nworld, not only at present, but from time immemorial, and the demons alone\nreject Him. Anyway, since K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the authority accepted by all, Arjuna put\nthis question before Him in order that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a would describe Himself without\nbeing depicted by the demons who always try to distort Him in a way\nunderstandable to the demons and their followers. It is necessary that everyone,\nfor his own interest, know the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore, when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself\nspeaks about Himself, it is auspicious for all the worlds. To the demons, such\nexplanations by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself may appear to be strange because the demons always\nstudy K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a from their own standpoint, but those who are devotees heartily\nwelcome the statements of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a when they are spoken by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself. The\ndevotees will always worship such authoritative statements of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a because they\nare always eager to know more and more about Him. The atheists, who consider\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a an ordinary man, may in this way come to know that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is superhuman,\nthat He is sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha\u2014the eternal form of bliss and knowledge\u2014that\nHe is transcendental, and that He is above the domination of the modes of\nmaterial nature and above the influence of time and space. A devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s,\nlike Arjuna, is undoubtedly above any misunderstanding of the transcendental\nposition of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Arjuna\u2019s putting this question before the Lord is simply an\nattempt by the devotee to defy the atheistic attitude of persons who consider\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to be an ordinary human being subject to the modes of material nature.",

PURPORT  In the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 we have information of many, many incarnations of the\nLord. lt is stated there:  advaitam acyutam an\u0101dim ananta-r\u016bpam \u0101dya\u1e41 pur\u0101\u1e47a-puru\u1e63a\u1e41 nava-yauvana\u1e41 ca\nvede\u1e63u durllabham adurllabham \u0101tma-bhaktau govindam \u0101di-puru\u1e63a\u1e41 tam aha\u1e41\nbhaj\u0101mi.  (Bs. 5.33)  \u201cI worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda [K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a], who is the\noriginal person\u2014absolute, infallible, without beginning, although expanded into\nunlimited forms, still the same original, the oldest, and the person always\nappearing as a fresh youth. Such eternal, blissful, all-knowing forms of the\nLord are usually understood by the best Vedic scholars, but they are always\nmanifest to pure, unalloyed devotees.\u201d It is also stated in Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101:  r\u0101m\u0101di m\u016brtti\u1e63u kal\u0101-niyamena ti\u1e63\u1e6dhan n\u0101n\u0101vat\u0101ram akarod bhuvane\u1e63u kintu k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u1e25\nsvaya\u1e41 samabhavat parama\u1e25 pum\u0101n yo govindam \u0101di-puru\u1e63a\u1e41 tam aha\u1e41 bhaj\u0101mi  (Bs. 5.39)  \u201cI worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda [K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a], who is always\nsituated in various incarnations such as R\u0101ma, N\u1e5bsi\u1e41ha and many sub-incarnations\nas well, but who is the original Personality of Godhead known as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and who\nincarnates personally also.\u201d  In the Vedas also it is said that the Lord, although one without a second,\nnevertheless manifests Himself in innumerable forms. He is like the vaidurya\nstone, which changes color yet still remains one. All those multi-forms are\nunderstood by the pure, unalloyed devotees, but not by a simple study of the\nVedas: vede\u1e63u durllabham adurllabham \u0101tma-bhaktau. Devotees like Arjuna are\nconstant companions of the Lord, and whenever the Lord incarnates, the associate\ndevotees also incarnate in order to serve the Lord in different capacities.\nArjuna is one of these devotees, and in this verse it is understood that some\nmillions of years ago when Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a spoke the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 to the sun-god\nVivasv\u0101n, Arjuna, in a different capacity, was also present. But the difference\nbetween the Lord and Arjuna is that the Lord remembered the incidence, whereas\nArjuna could not remember. That is the difference between the part and parcel\nliving entity and the Supreme Lord. Although Arjuna is addressed herein as the\nmighty hero who could subdue the enemies, he is unable to recall what had\nhappened in his various past births. Therefore, a living entity, however great\nhe may be in the material estimation, can never equal the Supreme Lord. Anyone\nwho is a constant companion of the Lord is certainly a liberated person, but he\ncannot be equal to the Lord. The Lord is described in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 as\ninfallible (acyuta), which means that He never forgets Himself, even though He\nis in material contact. Therefore, the Lord and the living entity can never be\nequal in all respects, even if the living entity is as liberated as Arjuna.\nAlthough Arjuna is a devotee of the Lord, he sometimes forgets the nature of the\nLord, but by the divine grace a devotee can at once understand the infallible\ncondition of the Lord, whereas a nondevotee or a demon cannot understand this\ntranscendental nature. Consequently these descriptions in the G\u012bt\u0101 cannot be\nunderstood by demonic brains. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a remembered acts which were performed by Him\nmillions of years before, but Arjuna could not, despite the fact that both K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nand Arjuna are eternal in nature. We may also note herein that a living entity\nforgets everything due to his change of body, but the Lord remembers because He\ndoes not change His sac-cid-\u0101nanda body. He is advaita, which means there is no\ndistinction between His body and Himself. Everything in relation to Him is\nspirit\u2014whereas the conditioned soul is different from his material body. And,\nbecause the Lord\u2019s body and self are identical, His position is always different\nfrom the ordinary living entity, even when He descends to the material platform.\nThe demons cannot adjust themselves to this transcendental nature of the Lord,\nas the Lord explains in the following verse.",

TRANSLATION  Although I am unborn and My transcendental body never deteriorates, and although\nI am the Lord of all sentient beings, I still appear in every millennium in My\noriginal transcendental form.  PURPORT  The Lord has spoken about the peculiarity of His birth: although He may appear\nlike an ordinary person, He remembers everything of His many, many past\n\u201cbirths,\u201d whereas a common man cannot remember what he has done even a few hours\nbefore. If someone is asked what he did exactly at the same time one day\nearlier, it would be very difficult for a common man to answer immediately. He\nwould surely have to dredge his memory to recall what he was doing exactly at\nthe same time one day before. And yet, men often dare claim to be God, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\nOne should not be misled by such meaningless claims. Then again, the Lord\nexplains His prak\u1e5bti or His form. Prak\u1e5bti means nature as well as svar\u016bpa, or\none\u2019s own form. The Lord says that He appears in His own body. He does not\nchange His body, as the common living entity changes from one body to another.\nThe conditioned soul may have one kind of body in the present birth, but he has\na different body in the next birth. In the material world, the living entity has\nno fixed body but transmigrates from one body to another. The Lord, however,\ndoes not do so. Whenever He appears, He does so in the same original body, by\nHis internal potency. In other words, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a appears in this material world in\nHis original eternal form, with two hands, holding a flute. He appears exactly\nin His eternal body, uncontaminated by this material world. Although He appears\nin the same transcendental body and is Lord of the universe, it still appears\nthat He takes His birth like an ordinary living entity. Despite the fact Lord\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a grows from childhood to boyhood and from boyhood to youth, astonishingly\nenough He never ages beyond youth. At the time of the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra, He\nhad many grandchildren at home; or, in other words, He had sufficiently aged by\nmaterial calculations. Still He looked just like a young man twenty or\ntwenty-five years old. We never see a picture of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in old age because He\nnever grows old like us, although He is the oldest person in the whole\ncreation\u2014past, present, and future. Neither His body nor His intelligence ever\ndeteriorates or changes. Therefore, it is clear that in spite of His being in\nthe material world, He is the same unborn, eternal form of bliss and knowledge,\nchangeless in His transcendental body and intelligence. Factually, His\nappearance and disappearance is like the sun\u2019s rising, moving before us, and\nthen disappearing from our eyesight. When the sun is out of sight, we think that\nthe sun is set, and when the sun is before our eyes, we think that the sun is on\nthe horizon. Actually, the sun is always in its fixed position, but owing to our\ndefective, insufficient senses, we calculate the appearance and disappearance of\nthe sun in the sky. And, because His appearance and disappearance are completely\ndifferent from that of any ordinary, common living entity, it is evident that He\nis eternal, blissful knowledge by His internal potency\u2014and He is never\ncontaminated by material nature. The Vedas also confirm that the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead is unborn, yet He still appears to take His birth in\nmulti-manifestations. The Vedic supplementary literatures also confirm that even\nthough the Lord appears to be taking His birth, He is still without change of\nbody. In the Bh\u0101gavatam, He appears before His mother as N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, with four\nhands and the decorations of the six kinds of full opulences. His appearance in\nHis original eternal form is His causeless mercy, according to the Vi\u015bvako\u015ba\ndictionary. The Lord is conscious of all of His previous appearances and\ndisappearances, but a common living entity forgets everything about his past\nbody as soon as he gets another body. He is the Lord of all living entities\nbecause He performs wonderful and superhuman activities while He is on this\nearth. Therefore, the Lord is always the same Absolute Truth and is without\ndifferentiation between His form and self, or between His quality and body. A\nquestion may now be raised as to why the Lord appears and disappears in this\nworld. This is explained in the next verse.",

PURPORT  The word s\u1e5bj\u0101mi is significant herein. S\u1e5bj\u0101mi cannot be used in the sense of\ncreation. because, according to the previous verse, there is no creation of the\nLord\u2019s form or body, since all of the forms are eternally existent. Therefore\ns\u1e5bj\u0101mi means that the Lord manifests Himself as He is. Although the Lord appears\non schedule, namely at the end of Dv\u0101para-yuga of the twenty-eighth millennium\nof the eighth Manu, in one day of Brahm\u0101, still He has no obligation to adhere\nto such rules and regulations because He is completely free to act in many ways\nat His will. He therefore appears by His own will whenever there is a\npredominance of irreligiosity and a disappearance of true religion. Principles\nof religion are laid down in the Vedas, and any discrepancy in the matter of\nproperly executing the rules of the Vedas makes one irreligious. In the\nBh\u0101gavatam it is stated that such principles are the laws of the Lord. Only the\nLord can manufacture a system of religion. The Vedas are also accepted as\noriginally spoken by the Lord Himself to Brahm\u0101, from within his heart.\nTherefore, the principles of dharma, or religion, are the direct orders of the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead (dharma\u1e41 tu s\u0101k\u1e63\u0101t-bhagavat-pra\u1e47\u012btam). These\nprinciples are clearly indicated throughout the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. The purpose of\nthe Vedas is to establish such principles under the order of the Supreme Lord,\nand the Lord directly orders, at the end of the G\u012bt\u0101, that the highest principle\nof religion is to surrender unto Him only, and nothing more. The Vedic\nprinciples push one towards complete surrender unto Him; and, whenever such\nprinciples are disturbed by the demonic, the Lord appears. From the Bh\u0101gavatam\nwe understand that Lord Buddha is the incarnation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a who appeared when\nmaterialism was rampant and materialists were using the pretext of the authority\nof the Vedas. Although there are certain restrictive rules and regulations\nregarding animal sacrifice for particular purposes in the Vedas, people of\ndemonic tendency still took to animal sacrifice without reference to the Vedic\nprinciples. Lord Buddha appeared to stop this nonsense and to establish the\nVedic principles of nonviolence. Therefore each and every avat\u0101ra, or\nincarnation of the Lord, has a particular mission, and they are all described in\nthe revealed scriptures. No one should be accepted as an avat\u0101ra unless he is\nreferred to by scriptures. It is not a fact that the Lord appears only on Indian\nsoil. He can advent Himself anywhere and everywhere, and whenever He desires to\nappear. In each and every incarnation, He speaks as much about religion as can\nbe understood by the particular people under their particular circumstances. But\nthe mission is the same\u2014to lead people to God consciousness and obedience to the\nprinciples of religion. Sometimes He descends personally, and sometimes He sends\nHis bona fide representative in the form of His son, or servant, or Himself in\nsome disguised form.  The principles of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 were spoken to Arjuna, and, for that matter,\nto other highly elevated persons, because he was highly advanced compared to\nordinary persons in other parts of the world. Two plus two equals four is a\nmathematical principle that is true both in the beginner\u2019s arithmetic class and\nin the advanced class as well. Still, there are higher and lower mathematics. In\nall incarnations of the Lord, therefore, the same principles are taught, but\nthey appear to be higher and lower in varied circumstances. The higher\nprinciples of religion begin with the acceptance of the four orders and the four\nstatuses of social life, as will be explained later. The whole purpose of the\nmission of incarnations is to arouse K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness everywhere. Such\nconsciousness is manifest and nonmanifest only under different circumstances.",

TRANSLATION  In order to deliver the pious and to annihilate the miscreants, as well as to\nreestablish the principles of religion, I advent Myself millennium after\nmillennium.  PURPORT  According to Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, a s\u0101dhu (holyman) is a man in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. A\nperson may appear to be irreligious, but if he has the qualifications of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness wholly and fully, he is to be understood to be a s\u0101dhu. And\ndu\u1e63k\u1e5btam applies to one who doesn\u2019t care for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Such\nmiscreants, or du\u1e63k\u1e5btam, are described as foolish and the lowest of mankind,\neven though they may be decorated with mundane education; whereas another\nperson, who is one hundred percent engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, is accepted\nas s\u0101dhu, even though such a person may neither be learned nor well cultured. As\nfar as the atheistic are concerned, it is not necessary for the Supreme Lord to\nappear as He is to destroy them, as He did with the demons R\u0101va\u1e47a and Ka\u1e41sa. The\nLord has many agents who are quite competent to vanquish demons. But the Lord\nespecially descends to appease His unalloyed devotees, who are always harassed\nby the demonic. The demon harasses the devotee, even though the latter may\nhappen to be his kin. Although Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was the son of Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu,\nhe was nonetheless persecuted by his father; although Devak\u012b, the mother of\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, was the sister of Ka\u1e41sa, she and her husband Vasudeva were persecuted\nonly because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was to be born of them. So Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a appeared primarily to\ndeliver Devak\u012b, rather than kill Ka\u1e41sa, but both were performed simultaneously.\nTherefore it is said here that to deliver the devotee and vanquish the demon\nmiscreants, the Lord appears in different incarnations.  In the Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47ad\u0101sa Kavir\u0101ja, the following verses summarize\nthese principles of incarnation:  s\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6di-hetu yei m\u016brti prapa\u00f1ce avatare sei \u012b\u015bvara-m\u016brti \u2018avat\u0101ra\u2019 n\u0101ma dhare\nm\u0101y\u0101tita paravyome sav\u0101ra avasth\u0101na vi\u015bve \u2018avat\u0101ri\u2019 dhare \u2018avat\u0101ra\u2019 n\u0101ma.  \u201cThe avat\u0101ra, or incarnation of Godhead, descends from the kingdom of God for\nmaterial manifestation. And the particular form of the Personality of Godhead\nwho so descends is called an incarnation, or avat\u0101ra. Such incarnations are\nsituated in the spiritual world, the kingdom of God. When they descend to the\nmaterial creation, they assume the name avat\u0101ra.\u201d  There are various kinds of avat\u0101ras, such as puru\u1e63\u0101vat\u0101ras, gu\u1e47\u0101vat\u0101ras,\nl\u012bl\u0101vat\u0101ras, \u015bakty\u0101ve\u015ba avat\u0101ras, manvantara-avat\u0101ras and yug\u0101vat\u0101ras\u2014all\nappearing on schedule all over the universe. But Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the primeval\nLord, the fountainhead of all avat\u0101ras. Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a descends for the specific\npurposes of mitigating the anxieties of the pure devotees, who are very anxious\nto see Him in His original V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana pastimes. Therefore, the prime purpose of\nthe K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a avat\u0101ra is to satisfy His unalloyed devotees.  The Lord says that He incarnates Himself in every millennium. This indicates\nthat He incarnates also in the age of Kali. As stated in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam,\nthe incarnation in the age of Kali is Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu, who spread the\nworship of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by the sa\u1e45k\u012brtana movement (congregational chanting of the holy\nnames), and spread K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness throughout India. He predicted that this\nculture of sa\u1e45k\u012brtana would be broadcast all over the world, from town to town\nand village to village. Lord Caitanya as the incarnation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the\nPersonality of Godhead, is described secretly but not directly in the\nconfidential parts of the revealed scriptures, such as the Upani\u1e63ads,\nMah\u0101bh\u0101rata, Bh\u0101gavatam, etc. The devotees of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are much attracted by\nthe sa\u1e45k\u012brtana movement of Lord Caitanya. This avat\u0101ra of the Lord does not kill\nthe miscreants, but delivers them by the causeless mercy of the Lord.",

TRANSLATION  One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does\nnot, upon leaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but\nattains My eternal abode, O Arjuna.  PURPORT  The Lord\u2019s descent from His transcendental abode is already explained in the 6th\nverse. One who can understand the truth of the appearance of the Personality of\nGodhead is already liberated from material bondage, and therefore he returns to\nthe kingdom of God immediately after quitting this present material body. Such\nliberation of the living entity from material bondage is not at all easy. The\nimpersonalists and the yog\u012bs attain liberation only after much trouble and many,\nmany births. Even then, the liberation they achieve\u2014merging into the impersonal\nbrahmajyoti of the Lord\u2014is only partial, and there is the risk of returning\nagain to this material world. But the devotee, simply by understanding the\ntranscendental nature of the body and activities of the Lord, attains the abode\nof the Lord after ending this body and does not run the risk of returning again\nto this material world. In the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 it is stated that the Lord has\nmany, many forms and incarnations: advaitam acyutam an\u0101dim ananta-r\u016bpam.\nAlthough there are many transcendental forms of the Lord, they are still one and\nthe same Supreme Personality of Godhead. One has to understand this fact with\nconviction, although it is incomprehensible to mundane scholars and empiric\nphilosophers. As stated in the Vedas:  eko devo nitya-l\u012bl\u0101nurakto bhakta-vy\u0101p\u012b h\u1e5bdy antar\u0101tm\u0101.  \u201cThe one Supreme Personality of Godhead is eternally engaged in many, many\ntranscendental forms in relationships with His unalloyed devotees.\u201d This Vedic\nversion is confirmed in this verse of the G\u012bt\u0101 personally by the Lord. He who\naccepts this truth on the strength of the authority of the Vedas and of the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead and who does not waste time in philosophical\nspeculations attains the highest perfectional stage of liberation. Simply by\naccepting this truth on faith, one can, without a doubt, attain liberation. The\nVedic version, \u201ctattvamasi,\u201d is actually applied in this case. Anyone who\nunderstands Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to be the Supreme, or who says unto the Lord, \u201cYou are\nthe same Supreme Brahman, the Personality of Godhead\u201d is certainly liberated\ninstantly, and consequently his entrance into the transcendental association of\nthe Lord is guaranteed. In other words, such a faithful devotee of the Lord\nattains perfection, and this is confirmed by the following Vedic assertion:  tam eva viditv\u0101tim\u1e5btyumeti n\u0101nya\u1e25 panth\u0101 vidyate ayan\u0101ya.  One can attain the perfect stage of liberation from birth and death simply by\nknowing the Lord, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. There is no alternative\nbecause anyone who does not understand Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead is surely in the mode of ignorance. Consequently he will not attain\nsalvation, simply, so to speak, by licking the outer surface of the bottle of\nhoney, or by interpreting the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 according to mundane scholarship.\nSuch empiric philosophers may assume very important roles in the material world,\nbut they are not necessarily eligible for liberation. Such puffed up mundane\nscholars have to wait for the causeless mercy of the devotee of the Lord. One\nshould therefore cultivate K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness with faith and knowledge, and in\nthis way attain perfection.",

TRANSLATION  Being freed from attachment, fear and anger, being fully absorbed in Me and\ntaking refuge in Me, many, many persons in the past became purifled by knowledge\nof Me\u2014and thus they all attained transcendental love for Me.  PURPORT  As described above, it is very difficult for a person who is too materially\naffected to understand the personal nature of the Supreme Absolute Truth.\nGenerally, people who are attached to the bodily conception of life are so\nabsorbed in materialism that it is almost impossible for them to understand that\nthere is a transcendental body which is imperishable, full of knowledge and\neternally blissful. In the materialistic concept, the body is perishable, full\nof ignorance and completely miserable. Therefore, people in general keep this\nsame bodily idea in mind when they are informed of the personal form of the\nLord. For such materialistic men, the form of the gigantic material\nmanifestation is supreme. Consequently they consider the Supreme to be\nimpersonal. And because they are too materially absorbed, the conception of\nretaining the personality after liberation from matter frightens them. When they\nare informed that spiritual life is also individual and personal, they become\nafraid of becoming persons again, and so they naturally prefer a kind of merging\ninto the impersonal void. Generally, they compare the living entities to the\nbubbles of the ocean, which merge into the ocean. That is the highest perfection\nof spiritual existence attainable without individual personality. This is a kind\nof fearful stage of life, devoid of perfect knowledge of spiritual existence.\nFurthermore there are many persons who cannot understand spiritual existence at\nall. Being embarassed by so many theories and by contradictions of various types\nof philosophical speculation, they become disgusted or angry and foolishly\nconclude that there is no supreme cause and that everything is ultimately void.\nSuch people are in a diseased condition of life. Some people are too materially\nattached and therefore do not give attention to spiritual life, some of them\nwant to merge into the supreme spiritual cause, and some of them disbelieve in\neverything, being angry at all sorts of spiritual speculation out of\nhopelessness. This last class of men take to the shelter of some kind of\nintoxication, and their affective hallucinations are sometimes accepted as\nspiritual vision. One has to get rid of all three stages of attachment to the\nmaterial world: negligence of spiritual life, fear of a spiritual personal\nidentity, and the conception of void that underlies the frustration of life. To\nget free from these three stages of the material concept of life, one has to\ntake complete shelter of the Lord, guided by the bona fide spiritual master, and\nfollow the disciplines and regulative principles of devotional life. The last\nstage of the devotional life is called bh\u0101va, or transcendental love of Godhead.  According to Bhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu, the science of devotional service:  \u0101dau \u015braddh\u0101 tata\u1e25 s\u0101dhu-sa\u1e45go \u2019tha bhajana-kriy\u0101 tato \u2019nartha-niv\u1e5btti\u1e25 sy\u0101t\ntato ni\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101 rucis tata\u1e25 ath\u0101saktis tato bh\u0101vas tata\u1e25 prem\u0101bhyuda\u00f1cati s\u0101dhak\u0101n\u0101m\naya\u1e41 prem\u1e47a\u1e25 pr\u0101durbh\u0101ve bhavet krama\u1e25.  \u201cIn the beginning one must have a preliminary desire for self-realization. This\nwill bring one to the stage of trying to associate with persons who are\nspiritually elevated. In next stage one becomes initiated by an elevated\nspiritual master, and under his instruction the neophyte devotee begins the\nprocess of devotional service. By execution of devotional service under the\nguidance of the spiritual master, one becomes free from all material attachment,\nattains steadiness in self-realization, and acquires a taste for hearing about\nthe Absolute Personality of Godhead, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This taste leads one further\nforward to attachment for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, which is matured in bh\u0101va, or the\npreliminary stage of transcendental love of God. Real love for God is called\nprem\u0101, the highest perfectional stage of life.\u201d In the prem\u0101 stage there is\nconstant engagement in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. So, by the\nslow process of devotional service, under the guidance of the bona fide\nspiritual master, one can attain the highest stage, being freed from all\nmaterial attachment, from the fearfulness of one\u2019s individual spiritual\npersonality, and from the frustrations resulting from void philosophy. Then one\ncan ultimately attain to the abode of the Supreme Lord.",

PURPORT  Eveyone is searching for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in the different aspects of His manifestations.\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is partially realized in His\nimpersonal brahmajyoti effulgence and as the all-pervading Supersoul dwelling\nwithin everything, including the particles of atoms. But K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is only fully\nrealized by His pure devotees. Consequently, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the object of everyone\u2019s\nrealization, and thus anyone and everyone is satisfied according to one\u2019s desire\nto have Him. In the transcendental world also, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a reciprocates with His pure\ndevotees in the transcendental attitude, just as the devotee wants Him. One\ndevotee may want K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as supreme master, another as his personal friend,\nanother as his son, and still another as his lover. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a rewards all the\ndevotees equally, according to their different intensities of love for Him. In\nthe material world, the same reciprocations of feelings are there, and they are\nequally exchanged by the Lord with the different types of worshipers. The pure\ndevotees both here and in the transcendental abode associate with Him in person\nand are able to render personal service to the Lord and thus derive\ntranscendental bliss in His loving service. As for those who are impersonalists\nand who want to commit spiritual suicide by annihilating the individual\nexistence of the living entity, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a helps also by absorbing them into His\neffulgence. Such impersonalists do not agree to accept the eternal, blissful\nPersonality of Godhead; consequently they cannot relish the bliss of\ntranscendental personal service to the Lord, having extinguished their\nindividuality. Some of them, who are not situated even in the impersonal\nexistence, return to this material field to exhibit their dormant desires for\nactivities. They are not admitted in the spiritual planets, but they are again\ngiven a chance to act on the material planets. For those who are fruitive\nworkers, the Lord awards the desired results of their prescribed duties, as the\nyaj\u00f1e\u015bvara; and those who are yog\u012bs seeking mystic powers are awarded such\npowers. In other words, everyone is dependant for success upon His mercy alone,\nand all kinds of spiritual processes are but different degrees of success on the\nsame path. Unless, therefore, one comes to the highest perfection of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness, all attempts remain imperfect, as is stated in the \u015ar\u012bmad\nBh\u0101gavatam:  ak\u0101ma\u1e25 sarva-k\u0101mo v\u0101 mok\u1e63a-k\u0101ma ud\u0101radh\u012b\u1e25 t\u012bvre\u1e47a bhakti-yogena yajeta puru\u1e63a\u1e41\nparam  \u201cWhether one is without desire [the condition of the devotees], or is desirous\nof all fruitive results, or is after liberation, one should with all efforts try\nto worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead for complete perfection,\nculminating in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 2.3.10)",

TRANSLATION  Men in this world desire success in fruitive activities, and therefore they\nworship the demigods. Quickly, of course, men get results from fruitive work in\nthis world.  PURPORT  There is a great misconception about the gods or demigods of this material\nworld, and men of less intelligence, although passing as great scholars, take\nthese demigods to be various forms of the Supreme Lord. Actually, the demigods\nare not different forms of God, but they are God\u2019s different parts and parcels.\nGod is one, and the parts and parcels are many. The Vedas say, nityo nity\u0101n\u0101m:\nGod is one. \u012a\u015bvara\u1e25 parama\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u1e25. The Supreme God is one\u2014K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2014and the\ndemigods are delegated with powers to manage this material world. These demigods\nare all living entities (nity\u0101n\u0101m) with different grades of material power. They\ncannot be equal to the Supreme God\u2014N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Anyone who thinks\nthat God and the demigods are on the same level is called an atheist, or\np\u0101\u1e63a\u1e47\u1e0d\u012b. Even the great demigods like Brahm\u0101 and \u015aiva cannot be compared to the\nSupreme Lord. In fact, the Lord is worshiped by demigods such as Brahm\u0101 and \u015aiva\n(\u015biva-viri\u00f1ci-nutam). Yet curiously enough there are many human leaders who are\nworshiped by foolish men under the misunderstanding of anthropomorphism or\nzoomorphism. Iha devat\u0101\u1e25 denotes a powerful man or demigod of this material\nworld. But N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, does\nnot belong to this world. He is above, or transcendental to, material creation.\nEven \u015ar\u012bp\u0101da \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101c\u0101rya, the leader of the impersonalists, maintains that\nN\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is beyond this material creation. However, foolish people\n(h\u1e5bt-a\u00f1jana) worship the demigods because they want immediate results. They get\nthe results, but do not know that results so obtained are temporary and are\nmeant for less intelligent persons. The intelligent person is in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness, and he has no need to worship the paltry demigods for some\nimmediate, temporary benefit. The demigods of this material world, as well as\ntheir worshipers, will vanish with the annihilation of this material world. The\nboons of the demigods are material and temporary. Both the material worlds and\ntheir inhabitants, including the demigods, and their worshipers, are bubbles in\nthe cosmic ocean. In this world, however, human society is mad after temporary\nthings such as the material opulence of possessing land, family and enjoyable\nparaphernalia. To achieve such temporary things, they worship the demigods or\npowerful men in human society. If a man gets some ministership in the government\nby worshiping a political leader, he considers that he has achieved a great\nboon. All of them are therefore kowtowing to the so-called leaders or \u201cbig guns\u201d\nin order to achieve temporary boons, and they indeed achieve such things. Such\nfoolish men are not interested in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness for the permanent solution\nto the hardships of material existence. They are all after sense enjoyment, and\nto get a little facility for sense enjoyment they are attracted to worship\nempowered living entities known as demigods. This verse indicates that people\nare rarely interested in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. They are mostly interested in\nmaterial enjoyment, and therefore they worship some powerful living entity.",

TRANSLATION  According to the three modes of material nature and the work ascribed to them,\nthe four divisions of human society were created by Me. And, although I am the\ncreator of this system, you should know that I am yet the non-doer, being\nunchangeable.  PURPORT  The Lord is the creator of everything. Everything is born of Him, everything is\nsustained by Him, and everything, after annihilation, rests in Him. He is\ntherefore the creator of the four divisions of the social order, beginning with\nthe intelligent class of men, technically called br\u0101hma\u1e47as due to their being\nsituated in the mode of goodness. Next is the administrative class, technically\ncalled the k\u1e63atriyas due to their being situated in the mode of passion. The\nmercantile men, called the vai\u015byas, are situated in the mixed modes of passion\nand ignorance, and the \u015b\u016bdras, or laborer class, are situated in the ignorant\nmode of material nature. In spite of His creating the four divisions of human\nsociety, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a does not belong to any of these divisions, because He is not\none of the conditioned souls, a section of whom form human society. Human\nsociety is similar to any other animal society, but to elevate men from the\nanimal status, the abovementioned divisions are created by the Lord for the\nsystematic development of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. The tendency of a particular man\ntoward work is determined by the modes of material nature which he has acquired.\nSuch symptoms of life, according to different modes of material nature, are\ndescribed in the Eighteenth Chapter of this book. A person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness, however, is above even the br\u0101hma\u1e47as, because a br\u0101hma\u1e47a by\nquality is supposed to know about Brahman, the Supreme Absolute Truth. Most of\nthem approach the impersonal Brahman manifestation of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but only a man\nwho transcends the limited knowledge of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a and reaches the knowledge of\nthe Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, becomes a person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness\u2014or, in other words, a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness includes\nknowledge of all different plenary expansions of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, namely R\u0101ma, N\u1e5bsi\u1e41ha,\nVar\u0101ha, etc. However, as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is transcendental to this system of the four\ndivisions of human society, a person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is also\ntranscendental to all divisions of human society, whether we consider the\ndivisions of community, nation or species.",

TRANSLATION  There is no work that affects Me; nor do I aspire for the fruits of action. One\nwho understands this truth about Me also does not become entangled in the\nfruitive reactions of work.  PURPORT  As there are constitutional laws in the material world stating that the king can\ndo no wrong, or that the king is not subject to the state laws, similarly the\nLord, although He is the creator of this material world, is not affected by the\nactivities of the material world. He creates and remains aloof from the\ncreation, whereas the living entities are entangled in the fruitive results of\nmaterial activities because of their propensity for lording it over material\nresources. The proprietor of an establishment is not responsible for the right\nand wrong activities of the workers, but the workers are themselves responsible.\nThe living entities are engaged in their respective activities of sense\ngratification, and these activities are not ordained by the Lord. For\nadvancement of sense gratification, the living entities are engaged in the work\nof this world, and they aspire to heavenly happiness after death. The Lord,\nbeing full in Himself, has no attraction for so-called heavenly happiness. The\nheavenly demigods are only His engaged servants. The proprietor never desires\nthe low-grade happiness such as the workers may desire. He is aloof from the\nmaterial actions and reactions. For example, the rains are not responsible for\ndifferent types of vegetation that appear on the earth, although without such\nrains there is no possibility of vegetative growth. Vedic sm\u1e5bti confirms this\nfact as follows:  nimitta-m\u0101tram ev\u0101sau s\u1e5bjy\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 sarga-karma\u1e47i pradh\u0101na-k\u0101ra\u1e47\u012b-bh\u016bt\u0101 yato vai\ns\u1e5bjya-\u015baktaya\u1e25.  In the material creations, the Lord is only the supreme cause. The immediate\ncause is material nature by which the cosmic manifestation is visible. The\ncreated beings are of many varieties, such as the demigods, human beings and\nlower animals, and all of them are subject to the reactions of their past good\nor bad activities. The Lord only gives them the proper facilities for such\nactivities and the regulations of the modes of nature, but He is never\nresponsible for their past and present activities. In the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btras it is\nconfirmed that the Lord is never partial to any living entity. The living entity\nis responsible for his own acts. The Lord only gives him facilities, through the\nagency of material nature, the external energy. Anyone who is fully conversant\nwith all the intricacies of this law of karma, or fruitive activities, does not\nbecome affected by the results of his activities. In other words, the person who\nunderstands this transcendental nature of the Lord is an experienced man in\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, and thus he is never subjected to the laws of karma. One\nwho does not know the transcendental nature of the Lord and who thinks that the\nactivities of the Lord are aimed at fruitive results, as are the activities of\nthe ordinary living entities, certainly becomes entangled himself in fruitive\nreaction. But one who knows the Supreme Truth is a liberated soul fixed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness.",

TRANSLATION  All the liberated souls in ancient times acted with this understanding and so\nattained liberation. Therefore, as the ancients, you should perform your duty in\nthis divine consciousness.  PURPORT  There are two classes of men. Some of them are full of polluted material things\nwithin their hearts, and some of them are materially free. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness\nis equally beneficial for both of these persons. Those who are full of dirty\nthings can take to the line of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness for a gradual cleansing\nprocess, following the regulative principles of devotional service. Those who\nare already cleansed of the impurities may continue to act in the same K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness so that others may follow their exemplary activities and thereby\nbe benefitted. Foolish persons or neophytes in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness often want to\nretire from activities without having knowledge of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Arjuna\u2019s\ndesire to retire from activities on the battlefield was not approved by the\nLord. One need only know how to act. To retire from the activities of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness and to sit aloof making a show of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness; is less\nimportant than actually engaging in the field of activities for the sake of\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Arjuna is here advised to act in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, following in the\nfootsteps of the Lord\u2019s previous disciples, such as the sun-god Vivasv\u0101n, as\nmentioned hereinbefore. The Supreme Lord knows all His past activities, as well\nas those of persons who acted in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness in the past. Therefore He\nrecommends the acts of the sun-god, who learned this art from the Lord some\nmillions of years before. All such students of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are mentioned here as\npast liberated persons, engaged in the discharge of duties allotted by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",

PURPORT  Action in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness has to be executed in accord with the examples of\nprevious bona fide devotees. This is recommended in the 15th verse. Why such\naction should not be independant will be explained in the text to follow.  To act in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, one has to follow the leadership of authorized\npersons who are in a line of disciplic succession as explained in the beginning\nof this chapter. The system of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness was first narrated to the\nsun-god, the sun-god explained it to his son Manu, Manu explained it to his son\nIk\u1e63v\u0101ku, and the system is current on this earth from that very remote time.\nTherefore, one has to follow in the footsteps of previous authorities in the\nline of disciplic succession. Otherwise even the most intelligent men will be\nbewildered regarding the standard actions of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. For this\nreason, the Lord decided to instruct Arjuna in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness directly.\nBecause of the direct instruction of the Lord to Arjuna, anyone who follows in\nthe footsteps of Arjuna is certainly not bewildered.  It is said that one cannot ascertain the ways of religion simply by imperfect\nexperimental knowledge. Actually, the principles of religion can only be laid\ndown by the Lord Himself. Dharma\u1e41 hi s\u0101k\u1e63\u0101t-bhagavat-pra\u1e47\u012btam. No one can\nmanufacture a religious principle by imperfect speculation. One must follow in\nthe footsteps of great authorities like Brahm\u0101, \u015aiva, N\u0101rada, Manu, Kum\u0101ra,\nKapila, Prahl\u0101da, Bh\u012b\u1e63ma, \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, Yamar\u0101ja, Janaka, etc. By mental\nspeculation one cannot ascertain what is religion or self-realization.\nTherefore, out of causeless mercy to His devotees, the Lord explains directly to\nArjuna what action is and what inaction is. Only action performed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness can deliver a person from the entanglement of material existence.",

PURPORT  How activities in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness can lead one ultimately to the spiritual\ngoal is described here. There are various activities in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, and\nall of them will be described in the following verses. But, for the present,\njust the principle of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is described. A conditioned soul,\nentangled in material contamination, is sure to act in the material atmosphere,\nand yet he has to get out of such an environment. The process by which the\nconditioned soul can get out of the material atmosphere is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\nFor example, a patient who is suffering from a disorder of the bowels due to\noverindulgence in milk products is cured by another milk product, namely curds.\nThe materially absorbed conditioned soul can be cured by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness as\nset forth here in the G\u012bt\u0101. This process is generally known as yaj\u00f1a, or\nactivities (sacrifices) simply meant for the satisfaction of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The\nmore the activities of the material world are performed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness,\nor for Vi\u1e63\u1e47u only, the more the atmosphere becomes spiritualized by complete\nabsorption. Brahman means spiritual. The Lord is spiritual, and the rays of His\ntranscendental body are called brahmajyoti, His spiritual effulgence. Everything\nthat exists is situated in that brahmajyoti, but when the jyoti is covered by\nillusion (m\u0101y\u0101) or sense gratification, it is called material. This material\nveil can be removed at once by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness; thus the offering for the\nsake of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, the consuming agent of such an offering or\ncontribution; the process of consumption, the contributor, and the result\nare\u2014all combined together\u2014Brahman, or the Absolute Truth. The Absolute Truth\ncovered by m\u0101y\u0101 is called matter. Matter dovetailed for the cause of the\nAbsolute Truth regains its spiritual quality. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is the process\nof converting the illusory consciousness into Brahman, or the Supreme. When the\nmind is fully absorbed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, it is said to be in sam\u0101dhi, or\ntrance. Anything done in such transcendental consciousness is called yaj\u00f1a, or\nsacrifice for the Absolute. In that condition of spiritual consciousness, the\ncontributor, the contribution, the consumption, the performer or leader of the\nperformance, and the result or ultimate gain\u2014everything\u2014becomes one in the\nAbsolute, the Supreme Brahman. That is the method of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.",

TRANSLATION  Some yog\u012bs perfectly worship the demigods by offering different sacrifices to\nthem, and some of them offer sacrffices in the fire of the Supreme Brahman.  PURPORT  As described above, a person engaged in discharging duties in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness is also called a perfect yog\u012b or a first-class mystic. But there\nare others also, who perform similar sacrifices in the worship of demigods, and\nstill others who sacrifice to the Supreme Brahman, or the impersonal feature of\nthe Supreme Lord. So there are different kinds of sacrifices in terms of\ndifferent categories. Such different categories of sacrifice by different types\nof performers only superficially demark varieties of sacrifice. Factual\nsacrifice means to satisfy the Supreme Lord, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, who is also known as Yaj\u00f1a.\nAll the different varieties of sacrifice can be placed within two primary\ndivisions: namely, sacrifice of worldly possessions and sacrifice in pursuit of\ntranscendental knowledge. Those who are in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness sacrifice all\nmaterial possessions for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord, while others, who\nwant some temporary material happiness, sacrifice their material possessions to\nsatisfy demigods such as Indra, the sun-god, etc. And others, who are\nimpersonalists, sacrifice their identity by merging into the existence of\nimpersonal Brahman. The demigods are powerful living entities appointed by the\nSupreme Lord for the maintenance and supervision of all material functions like\nthe heating, watering and lighting of the universe. Those who are interested in\nmaterial benefits worship the demigods by various sacrifices according to the\nVedic rituals. They are called bahv-\u012b\u015bvara-v\u0101d\u012b, or believers in many gods. But\nothers, who worship the impersonal feature of the Absolute Truth and regard the\nforms of the demigods as temporary, sacrifice their individual selves in the\nsupreme fire and thus end their individual existences by merging into the\nexistence of the Supreme. Such impersonalists spend their time in philosophical\nspeculation to understand the transcendental nature of the Supreme. In other\nwords, the fruitive workers sacrifice their material possessions for material\nenjoyment, whereas the impersonalist sacrifices his material designations with a\nview to merging into the existence of the Supreme. For the impersonalist, the\nfire altar of sacrifice is the Supreme Brahman, and the offering is the self\nbeing consumed by the fire of Brahman. The K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person, like Arjuna,\nhowever, sacrifices everything for the satisfaction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and thus all his\nmaterial possessions as well as his own self\u2014everything\u2014is sacrificed for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\nThus, he is the first-class yog\u012b; but he does not lose his individual existence.",

TRANSLATION  Some of them sacrifice the hearing process and the senses in the fire of the\ncontrolled mind, and others sacrifice the objects of the senses, such as sound,\nin the fire of sacrifice.  PURPORT  The four divisions of human life, namely the brahmac\u0101r\u012b, the g\u1e5bhastha, the\nv\u0101naprastha, and the sanny\u0101s\u012b, are all meant to help men become perfect yog\u012bs or\ntranscendentalists. Since human life is not meant for our enjoying sense\ngratification like the animals, the four orders of human life are so arranged\nthat one may become perfect in spiritual life. The brahmac\u0101r\u012bs, or students\nunder the care of a bona fide spiritual master, control the mind by abstaining\nfrom sense gratification. They are referred to in this verse as sacrificing the\nhearing process and the senses in the fire of the controlled mind. A brahmac\u0101r\u012b\nhears only words concerning K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness; hearing is the basic principle\nfor understanding, and therefore the pure brahmac\u0101r\u012b engages fully in harer\nn\u0101m\u0101nuk\u012brtanam\u2014chanting and hearing the glories of the Lord. He restrains\nhimself from the vibrations of material sounds, and his hearing is engaged in\nthe transcendental sound vibration of Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Similarly, the\nhouseholders, who have some license for sense gratification, perform such acts\nwith great restraint. Sex life, intoxication and meat eating are general\ntendencies of human society, but a regulated householder does not indulge in\nunrestricted sex life and other sense gratifications. Marriage on principles of\nreligious life is therefore current in all civilized human society because that\nis the way for restricted sex life. This restricted, unattached sex life is also\na kind of yaj\u00f1a because the restricted householder sacrifices his general\ntendency toward sense gratification for higher transcendental life.",

PURPORT  The yoga system conceived by Pata\u00f1jali is referred to herein. In the Yoga-s\u016btra\nof Pata\u00f1jali, the soul is called pratyag-\u0101tm\u0101 and parag-\u0101tm\u0101. As long as the\nsoul is attached to sense enjoyment, it is called parag-\u0101tm\u0101. The soul is\nsubjected to the functions of ten kinds of air at work within the body, and this\nis perceived through the breathing system. The P\u0101ta\u00f1jala system of yoga\ninstructs one on how to control the functions of the body\u2019s air in a technical\nmanner so that ultimately all the functions of the air within become favorable\nfor purifying the soul of material attachment. According to this yoga system,\npratyag \u0101tm\u0101 is the ultimate goal. This pratyag \u0101tm\u0101 is a withdrawal from\nactivities in matter. The senses interact with the sense objects, like the ear\nfor hearing, eyes for seeing, nose for smelling, tongue for tasting, hand for\ntouching, and all of them are thus engaged in activities outside the self.

TRANSLATION  There are others who, enlightened by sacrificing their material possessions in\nsevere austerities, take strict vows and practice the yoga of eightfold\nmysticism, and others study the Vedas for the advancement of transcendental\nknowledge.  PURPORT  These sacrifices may be fitted into various divisions. There are persons who are\nsacrificing their possessions in the form of various kinds of charities. In\nIndia, the rich mercantile community or princely orders open various kinds of\ncharitable institutions like dharma\u015b\u0101l\u0101, anna-k\u1e63etra, atithi-\u015b\u0101l\u0101, anathalaya,\nvidy\u0101p\u012b\u1e6dha, etc. In other countries, too, there are many hospitals, old age\nhomes and similar charitable foundations meant for distributing food, education\nand medical treatment free to the poor. All these charitable activities are\ncalled dravyamaya-yaj\u00f1a. There are others who, for higher elevation in life or\nfor promotion to higher planets within the universe, voluntarily accept many\nkinds of austerities such as candr\u0101yana and c\u0101turm\u0101sya. These processes entail\nsevere vows for conducting life under certain rigid rules. For example, under\nthe c\u0101turm\u0101sya vow the candidate does not shave for four months during the year\n(July to October), he does not eat certain foods, does not eat twice in a day\nand does not leave home. Such sacrifice of the comforts of life is called\ntapomaya-yaj\u00f1a. There are still others who engage themselves in different kinds\nof mystic yogas like the Pata\u00f1jali system (for merging into the existence of the\nAbsolute), or ha\u1e6dha-yoga or a\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45ga-yoga (for particular perfections). And some\ntravel to all the sanctified places of pilgrimage. All these practices are\ncalled yoga-yaj\u00f1a, sacrifice for a certain type of perfection in the material\nworld. There are others who engage themselves in the studies of different Vedic\nliteratures, specifically the Upani\u1e63ads and Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btras, or the s\u0101\u1e45khya\nphilosophy. All of these are called sv\u0101dhy\u0101ya-yaj\u00f1a, or engagement in the\nsacrifice of studies. All these yog\u012bs are faithfully engaged in different types\nof sacrifice and are seeking a higher status of life. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, is,\nhowever, different from these because it is the direct service of the Supreme\nLord. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness cannot be attained by any one of the above-mentioned\ntypes of sacrifices but can be attained only by the mercy of the Lord and His\nbona fide devotee. Therefore, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is transcendental.",

TRANSLATION  And there are even others who are inclined to the process of breath restraint to\nremain in trance, and they practice stopping the movement of the outgoing breath\ninto the incoming, and incoming breath into the outgoing, and thus at last\nremain in trance, stopping all breathing. Some of them, curtailing the eating\nprocess, offer the outgoing breath into itself, as a sacrifice.  PURPORT  This system of yoga for controlling the breathing process is called pr\u0101\u1e47\u0101y\u0101ma,\nand in the beginning it is practiced in the ha\u1e6dha-yoga system through different\nsitting postures. All of these processes are recommended for controlling the\nsenses and for advancement in spiritual realization. This practice involves\ncontrolling the air within the body to enable simultaneous passage in opposite\ndirections. The ap\u0101na air goes downward, and the pr\u0101\u1e47a air goes up. The\npr\u0101\u1e47\u0101y\u0101ma yog\u012b practices breathing the opposite way until the currents are\nneutralized into p\u016braka, equilibrium. Similarly, when the exhaled breathing is\noffered to inhaled breathing, it is called recaka. When both air currents are\ncompletely stopped, it is called kumbhaka-yoga. By practice of kumbhaka-yoga,\nthe yog\u012bs increase the duration of life by many, many years. A K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious\nperson, however, being always situated in the transcendental loving service of\nthe Lord, automatically becomes the controller of the senses. His senses, being\nalways engaged in the service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, have no chance of becoming otherwise\nengaged. So at the end of life, he is naturally transferred to the\ntranscendental plane of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; consequently he makes no attempt to increase\nhis longevity. He is at once raised to the platform of liberation. A K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconscious person begins from the transcendental stage, and he is constantly in\nthat consciousness. Therefore, there is no falling down, and ultimately he\nenters into the abode of the Lord without delay. The practice of reduced eating\nis automatically done when one eats only K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a pras\u0101dam, or food which is\noffered first to the Lord. Reducing the eating process is very helpful in the\nmatter of sense control. And without sense control there is no possibility of\ngetting out of the material entanglement.",

Sense gratification is the root cause of material\nexistence; therefore, unless and until one is situated on a platform apart from\nsense gratification, there is no chance of being elevated to the eternal\nplatform of full knowledge, full bliss and full life. This platform is in the\neternal atmosphere, or Brahman atmosphere. All the above-mentioned sacrifices\nhelp one to become cleansed of the sinful reactions of material existence. By\nthis advancement in life, one not only becomes happy and opulent in this life,\nbut also, at the end, he enters into the eternal kingdom of God, either merging\ninto the impersonal Brahman or associating with the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",

TRANSLATION  O best of the Kuru dynasty, without sacrifice one can never live happily on this\nplanet or in this life: what then of the next?  PURPORT  Whatever form of material existence one is in, one is invariably ignorant of his\nreal situation. In other words, existence in the material world is due to the\nmultiple reactions to our sinful lives. Ignorance is the cause of sinful life,\nand sinful life is the cause of one\u2019s dragging on in material existence. The\nhuman form of life is the only loophole by which one may get out of this\nentanglement. The Vedas, therefore, give us a chance for escape by pointing out\nthe paths of religion, economic comfort, regulated sense gratification and, at\nlast, the means to get out of the miserable condition entirely. The path of\nreligion, or the different kinds of sacrifice recommended above, automatically\nsolves our economic problems. By performance of yaj\u00f1a we can have enough food,\nenough milk, etc.\u2014even if there is a so-called increase of population. When the\nbody is fully supplied, naturally the next stage is to satisfy the senses. The\nVedas prescribe, therefore, sacred marriage for regulated sense gratification.\nThereby one is gradually elevated to the platform of release from material\nbondage, and the highest perfection of liberated life is to associate with the\nSupreme Lord. Perfection is achieved by performance of yaj\u00f1a (sacrifice), as\ndescribed above. Now, if a person is not inclined to perform yaj\u00f1a according to\nthe Vedas, how can he expect a happy life? There are different grades of\nmaterial comforts in different heavenly planets, and in all cases there is\nimmense happiness for persons engaged in different kinds of yaj\u00f1a. But the\nhighest kind of happiness that a man can achieve is to be promoted to the\nspiritual planets by practice of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. A life of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness is therefore the solution to all the problems of material\nexistence.",

Sacrifices sometimes take different\nforms according to the particular faith of the performer.

Real\nknowledge culminates in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, the highest stage of transcendental\nknowledge. Without the elevation of knowledge, sacrifices are simply material\nactivities. When, however, they are elevated to the level of transcendental\nknowledge, all such activities enter onto the spiritual platform. Depending on\ndifferences in consciousness, sacrificial activities are sometimes called\nkarma-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da, fruitive activities, and sometimes j\u00f1\u0101na-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da, knowledge in the\npursuit of truth.

The self-realized soul can impart\nknowledge unto you because he has seen the truth.  PURPORT  The path of spiritual realization is undoubtedly difficult. The Lord therefore\nadvises us to approach a bona fide spiritual master in the line of disciplic\nsuccession from the Lord Himself. No one can be a bona fide spiritual master\nwithout following this principle of disciplic succession. The Lord is the\noriginal spiritual master, and a person in the disciplic succession can convey\nthe message of the Lord as it is to his disciple. No one can be spiritually\nrealized by manufacturing his own process, as is the fashion of the foolish\npretenders. The Bh\u0101gavatam says: dharma\u1e41 hi s\u0101k\u1e63\u0101d-bhagavat-pra\u1e47\u012btam\u2014the path of\nreligion is directly enunciated by the Lord. Therefore, mental speculation or\ndry arguments cannot help one progress in spiritual life. One has to approach a\nbona fide spiritual master to receive the knowledge. Such a spiritual master\nshould be accepted in full surrender, and one should serve the spiritual master\nlike a menial servant, without false prestige. Satisfaction of the self-realized\nspiritual master is the secret of advancement in spiritual life. Inquiries and\nsubmission constitute the proper combination for spiritual understanding. Unless\nthere is submission and service, inquiries from the learned spiritual master\nwill not be effective. One must be able to pass the test of the spiritual\nmaster, and when he sees the genuine desire of the disciple, he automatically\nblesses the disciple with genuine spiritual understanding. In this verse, both\nblind following and absurd inquiries are condemned. One should not only hear\nsubmissively from the spiritual master; but one must also get a clear\nunderstanding from him, in submission and service and inquiries. A bona fide\nspiritual master is by nature very kind toward the disciple. Therefore when the\nstudent is submissive and is always ready to render service, the reciprocation\nof knowledge and inquiries becomes perfect.",

TRANSLATION  And when you have thus learned the truth, you will know that all living beings\nare but part of Me\u2014and that they are in Me, and are Mine.  PURPORT  The result of receiving knowledge from a self-realized soul, or one who knows\nthings as they are, is learning that all living beings are parts and parcels of\nthe Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The sense of a separated\nexistence from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is called m\u0101y\u0101 (m\u0101\u2014not, y\u0101\u2014this). Some think that we have\nnothing to do with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is only a great historical personality and\nthat the Absolute is the impersonal Brahman. Factually, as it is stated in the\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, this impersonal Brahman is the personal effulgence of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the cause of everything. In the\nBrahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 it is clearly stated that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead, the cause of all causes. Even the millions of incarnations are only His\ndifferent expansions. Similarly, the living entities are also expansions of\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophers wrongly think that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a loses His own separate\nexistence in His many expansions. This thought is material in nature. We have\nexperience in the material world that a thing, when fragmentally distributed,\nloses its own original identity. But the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophers fail to\nunderstand that Absolute means that one plus one is equal to one, and that one\nminus one is also equal to one. This is the case in the absolute world.  For want of sufficient knowledge in the absolute science, we are now covered\nwith illusion, and therefore we think that we are separate from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Although\nwe are separated parts of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, we are nevertheless not different from Him. The\nbodily difference of the living entities is m\u0101y\u0101, or not actual fact. We are all\nmeant to satisfy K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. By m\u0101y\u0101 alone Arjuna thought that the temporary bodily\nrelationship with his kinsmen was more important than his eternal spiritual\nrelationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The whole teaching of the G\u012bt\u0101 is targetted toward this\nend: that a living being, as His eternal servitor, cannot be separated from\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and his sense of being an identity apart from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is called m\u0101y\u0101. The\nliving entities, as separate parts and parcels of the Supreme, have a purpose to\nfulfill. Having forgotten that purpose, since time immemorial they are situated\nin different bodies, as men, animals, demigods, etc. Such bodily differences\narise from forgetfulness of the transcendental service of the Lord. But when one\nis engaged in transcendental service through K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, one becomes at\nonce liberated from this illusion. One can acquire such pure knowledge only from\nthe bona fide spiritual master and thereby avoid the delusion that the living\nentity is equal to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Perfect knowledge is that the Supreme Soul, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is\nthe supreme shelter for all living entities, and giving up such shelter, the\nliving entities are deluded by the material energy, imagining themselves to have\na separate identity. Thus, under different standards of material identity, they\nbecome forgetful of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. When, however, such deluded living entities become\nsituated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, it is to be understood that they are on the\npath of liberation, as confirmed in the Bh\u0101gavatam: muktir hitv\u0101nyath\u0101 r\u016bpa\u1e41\nsvar\u016bpe\u1e47a vyavasthiti\u1e25. Liberation means to be situated in one\u2019s constitutional\nposition as the eternal servitor of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness).",

TRANSLATION  Therefore the doubts which have arisen in your heart out of ignorance should be\nslashed by the weapon of knowledge. Armed with yoga, O Bh\u0101rata, stand and fight.  PURPORT  The yoga system instructed in this chapter is called san\u0101tana-yoga, or eternal\nactivities performed by the living entity. This yoga has two divisions of\nsacrificial actions: one is called sacrifice of one\u2019s material possessions, and\nthe other is called knowledge of self, which is pure spiritual activity. If\nsacrifice of one\u2019s material possessions is not dovetailed for spiritual\nrealization, then such sacrifice becomes material. But one who performs such\nsacrifices with a spiritual objective, or in devotional service, makes a perfect\nsacrifice. When we come to spiritual activities, we find that these are also\ndivided into two: namely, understanding of one\u2019s own self (or one\u2019s\nconstitutional position), and the truth regarding the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead. One who follows the path of the G\u012bt\u0101 as it is can very easily\nunderstand these two important divisions of spiritual knowledge. For him there\nis no difficulty in obtaining perfect knowledge of the self as part and parcel\nof the Lord. And such understanding is beneficial for such a person who easily\nunderstands the transcendental activities of the Lord. In the beginning of this\nchapter, the transcendental activities of the Lord were discussed by the Supreme\nLord Himself. One who does not understand the instructions of the G\u012bt\u0101 is\nfaithless, and is to be considered to be misusing the fragmental independence\nawarded to him by the Lord. In spite of such instructions, one who does not\nunderstand the real nature of the Lord as the eternal, blissful, all-knowing\nPersonality of Godhead, is certainly fool number one. Ignorance can be removed\nby gradual acceptance of the principles of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness is awakened by different types of sacrifices to the demigods,\nsacrifice to Brahman, sacrifice in celibacy, in household life, in controlling\nthe senses, in practicing mystic yoga, in penance, in foregoing material\npossessions, in studying the Vedas, and in partaking of the social institution\ncalled var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma. All of these are known as sacrifice, and all of them\nare based on regulated action. But within all these activities, the important\nfactor is self-realization. One who seeks that objective is the real student of\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, but one who doubts the authority of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a falls back. One is\ntherefore advised to study Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, or any other scripture, under a bona\nfide spiritual master, with service and surrender. A bona fide spiritual master\nis in the disciplic succession from time eternal, and he does not deviate at all\nfrom the instructions of the Supreme Lord as they were imparted millions of\nyears ago to the sun-god, from whom the instructions of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 have come\ndown to the earthly kingdom. One should, therefore, follow the path of\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 as it is expressed in the G\u012bt\u0101 itself and beware of\nself-interested people after personal aggrandizement who deviate others from the\nactual path. The Lord is definitely the supreme person, and His activities are\ntranscendental. One who understands this is a liberated person from the very\nbeginning of his study of the G\u012bt\u0101.\nKarma-yoga\u2014Action in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Consciousness",

Now will You kindly tell me definitely which\nof the two is more beneficial?\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nIn this Fifth Chapter of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, the Lord says that work in\ndevotional service is better than dry mental speculation. Devotional service is\neasier than the latter because, being transcendental in nature, it frees one\nfrom reaction. In the Second Chapter, preliminary knowledge of the soul and its\nentanglement in the material body were explained. How to get out of this\nmaterial encagement by buddhi-yoga, or devotional service, was also explained\ntherein. In the Third Chapter, it was explained that a person who is situated on\nthe platform of knowledge no longer has any duties to perform. And, in the\nFourth Chapter, the Lord told Arjuna that all kinds of sacrificial work\nculminate in knowledge. However, at the end of the Fourth Chapter, the Lord\nadvised Arjuna to wake up and fight, being situated in perfect knowledge.\nTherefore, by simultaneously stressing the importance of both work in devotion\nand inaction in knowledge, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has perplexed Arjuna and confused his\ndetermination. Arjuna understands that renunciation in knowledge involves\ncessation of all kinds of work performed as sense activities. But if one\nperforms work in devotional service, then how is work stopped? In other words,\nhe thinks that sanny\u0101sam, or renunciation in knowledge, should be altogether\nfree from all kinds of activity because work and renunciation appear to him to\nbe incompatible. He appears not to have understood that work in full knowledge\nis nonreactive and is therefore the same as inaction.

As long as one is engaged in activities aimed at improving the standard\nof bodily comfort, one is sure to transmigrate to different types of bodies,\nthereby continuing material bondage perpetually. \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam confirms this\nas follows:\n\n\nn\u016bna\u1e41 pramatta\u1e25 kurute vikarma yad indriya-pr\u012btaya \u0101p\u1e5b\u1e47oti na s\u0101dhu manye yata\n\u0101tmano \u2019yam asann api kle\u015bada \u0101sa deha\u1e25\n\n\npar\u0101bhavas t\u0101vad abodha-j\u0101to y\u0101vanna jij\u00f1\u0101sata \u0101tma-tattvam y\u0101vat kriy\u0101s t\u0101vad\nida\u1e41 mano vai karm\u0101tmaka\u1e41 yena \u015bar\u012bra-bandha\u1e25\n\n\neva\u1e41 mana\u1e25 karma-va\u015ba\u1e41 prayu\u1e45kte avidyay\u0101tmany upadh\u012byam\u0101ne pr\u012btir na y\u0101van mayi\nv\u0101sudeve na mucyate deha-yogena t\u0101vat\n\n\n\u201cPeople are mad after sense gratification, and they do not know that this\npresent body, which is full of miseries, is a result of one\u2019s fruitive\nactivities in the past. Although this body is temporary, it is always giving one\ntrouble in many ways. Therefore, to act for sense gratification is not good. One\nis considered to be a failure in life as long as he makes no inquiry about the\nnature of work for fruitive results, for as long as one is engrossed in the\nconsciousness of sense gratification, one has to transmigrate from one body to\nanother. Although the mind may be engrossed in fruitive activities and\ninfluenced by ignorance, one must develop a love for devotional service to\nV\u0101sudeva. Only then can one have the opportunity to get out of the bondage of\nmaterial existence.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 5.5.4-6)\n\n\nTherefore, j\u00f1\u0101na (or knowledge that one is not this material body but spirit\nsoul) is not sufficient for liberation. One has to act in the status of spirit\nsoul, otherwise there is no escape from material bondage. Action in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness is not, however, action on the fruitive platform. Activities\nperformed in full knowledge strengthen one\u2019s advancement in real knowledge.\nWithout K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, mere renunciation of fruitive activities does not\nactually purify the heart of a conditioned soul. As long as the heart is not\npurified, one has to work on the fruitive platform. But action in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness automatically helps one escape the result of fruitive action so\nthat one need not descend to the material platform. Therefore, action in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness is always superior to renunciation, which always entails a risk of\nfalling. Renunciation without K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is incomplete, as is confirmed\nby \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b in his Bhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu.\n\n\npr\u0101pa\u00f1cikatay\u0101 buddhy\u0101 hari-sambandhi-vastuna\u1e25 mumuk\u1e63ubhi\u1e25 parity\u0101go vair\u0101gya\u1e41\nphalgu kathyate.\n\n\n\u201cRenunciation by persons eager to achieve liberation of things which are related\nto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, though they are material, is called\nincomplete renunciation.\u201d Renunciation is compete when it is in the knowledge\nthat everything in existence belongs to the Lord and that no one should claim\nproprietorship over anything. One should understand that, factually, nothing\nbelongs to anyone. Then where is the question of renunciation? One who knows\nthat everything is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s property is always situated in renunciation. Since\neverything belongs to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, everything should be employed in the service of\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This perfect form of action in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is far better than any\namount of artificial renunciation by a sanny\u0101s\u012b of the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b school.\n\n\n5.3\n\n\nj\u00f1eya\u1e25 sa nitya-sanny\u0101s\u012b\n\n\nyo na dve\u1e63\u1e6di na k\u0101\u1e45k\u1e63ati\n\n\nnirdvandvo hi mah\u0101-b\u0101ho\n\n\nsukha\u1e41 bandh\u0101t pramucyate\n\n\nj\u00f1eya\u1e25\u2014should be known; sa\u1e25\u2014he; nitya\u2014always; sanny\u0101s\u012b\u2014renouncer; ya\u1e25\u2014who;\nna\u2014never; dve\u1e63\u1e6di\u2014abhors; na\u2014nor; k\u0101\u1e45k\u1e63ati\u2014desires; nirdvandva\u1e25\u2014free from all\ndualities; hi\u2014certainly; mah\u0101-b\u0101ho\u2014O mighty-armed one; sukham\u2014happily;\nbandh\u0101t\u2014from bondage; pramucyate\u2014completely liberated.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nOne who neither hates nor desires the fruits of his activities is known to be\nalways renounced.

Such a renouncer,\ndedicated to the transcendental loving service of the Lord, is fully qualified\nin knowledge because he knows his constitutional position in his relationship\nwith K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He knows fully well that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the whole and that he is part and\nparcel of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Such knowledge is perfect because it is qualitatively and\nquantitatively correct. The concept of oneness with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is incorrect because\nthe part cannot be equal to the whole. Knowledge that one is one in quality yet\ndifferent in quantity is correct transcendental knowledge leading one to become\nfull in himself, having nothing to aspire to nor lament over. There is no\nduality in his mind because whatever he does, he does for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Being thus\nfreed from the platform of dualities, he is liberated\u2014even in this material\nworld.\n\n\n5.4\n\n\ns\u0101\u1e45khya-yogau p\u1e5bthag b\u0101l\u0101\u1e25\n\n\npravadanti na pa\u1e47\u1e0dit\u0101\u1e25\n\n\nekam apy \u0101sthita\u1e25 samyag\n\n\nubhayor vindate phalam\n\n\ns\u0101\u1e45khya\u2014analytical study of the material world; yogau\u2014work in devotional\nservice; p\u1e5bthak\u2014different; b\u0101l\u0101\u1e25\u2014less intelligent; pravadanti\u2014do talk; na\u2014never;\npa\u1e47\u1e0dit\u0101\u1e25\u2014the learned; ekam\u2014in one; api\u2014even though; \u0101sthita\u1e25\u2014being situated;\nsamyak\u2014complete; ubhayo\u1e25\u2014of both; vindate\u2014enjoys; phalam\u2014result.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nOnly the ignorant speak of karma-yoga and devotional service as being different\nfrom the analytical study of the material world [s\u0101\u1e45khya]. Those who are\nactually learned say that he who applies himself well to one of these paths\nachieves the results of both.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe aim of the analytical study of the material world is to find the soul of\nexistence. The soul of the material world is Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, or the Supersoul. Devotional\nservice to the Lord entails service to the Supersoul. One process is to find the\nroot of the tree, and next to water the root. The real student of s\u0101\u1e45khya\nphilosophy finds the root of the material world, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, and then, in perfect\nknowledge, engages himself in the service of the Lord. Therefore, in essence,\nthere is no difference between the two because the aim of both is Vi\u1e63\u1e47u.

By s\u0101\u1e45khya philosophical\nresearch one comes to the conclusion that a living entity is not a part and\nparcel of the material world, but of the supreme spirit whole. Consequently, the\nspirit soul has nothing to do with the material world; his actions must be in\nsome relation with the Supreme. When he acts in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, he is\nactually in his constitutional position. In the first process of s\u0101\u1e45khya, one\nhas to become detached from matter, and in the devotional yoga process one has\nto attach himself to the work of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Factually, both processes are the same,\nalthough superficially one process appears to involve detachment and the other\nprocess appears to involve attachment. However, detachment from matter and\nattachment to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are one and the same.

The sages, purified by works of devotion,\nachieve the Supreme without delay.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThere are two classes of sanny\u0101s\u012bs, or persons in the renounced order of life.\nThe M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b sanny\u0101s\u012bs are engaged in the study of s\u0101\u1e45khya philosophy, whereas\nthe Vaisnava sanny\u0101s\u012bs are engaged in the study of Bh\u0101gavatam philosophy, which\naffords the proper commentary on the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btras. The M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b sanny\u0101s\u012bs also\nstudy the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btras, but use their own commentary, called \u015a\u0101r\u012braka-bh\u0101\u1e63ya,\nwritten by \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101c\u0101rya. The students of the Bh\u0101gavata school are engaged in\ndevotional service of the Lord, according to p\u0101\u00f1car\u0101trik\u012b regulations, and\ntherefore the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava sanny\u0101s\u012bs have multiple engagements in the transcendental\nservice of the Lord. The Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava sanny\u0101s\u012bs have nothing to do with material\nactivities, and yet they perform various activities in their devotional service\nto the Lord. But the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b sanny\u0101s\u012bs, engaged in the studies of s\u0101\u1e45khya and\nVed\u0101nta and speculation, cannot relish transcendental service of the Lord.\nBecause their studies become very tedious, they sometimes become tired of\nBrahman speculation, and thus they take shelter of the Bh\u0101gavatam without proper\nunderstanding. Consequently their study of the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam becomes\ntroublesome. Dry speculations and impersonal interpretations by artificial means\nare all useless for the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b sanny\u0101s\u012bs. The Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava sanny\u0101s\u012bs, who are\nengaged in devotional service, are happy in the discharge of their\ntranscendental duties, and they have the guarantee of ultimate entrance into the\nkingdom of God. The M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b sanny\u0101s\u012bs sometimes fall down from the path of\nself-realization and again enter into material activities of a philanthropic and\naltruistic nature, which are nothing but material engagements. Therefore, the\nconclusion is that those who are engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness are better\nsituated than the sanny\u0101s\u012bs engaged in simple Brahman speculation, although they\ntoo come to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, after many births.\n\n\n5.7\n\n\nyoga-yukto vi\u015buddh\u0101tm\u0101\n\n\nvijit\u0101tm\u0101 jitendriya\u1e25\n\n\nsarva-bh\u016bt\u0101tma-bh\u016bt\u0101tm\u0101\n\n\nkurvann api na lipyate\n\n\nyoga-yukta\u1e25\u2014engaged in devotional service; vi\u015buddha-\u0101tm\u0101\u2014a purified soul;\nvijita-\u0101tm\u0101\u2014self-controlled; jita-indriya\u1e25\u2014having conquered the senses;\nsarvabhuta-\u0101tmabh\u016bta-\u0101tm\u0101\u2014compassionate to all living entities; kurvan\napi\u2014although engaged in work; na\u2014never; lipyate\u2014is entangled.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nOne who works in devotion, who is a pure soul, and who controls his mind and\nsenses, is dear to everyone, and everyone is dear to him. Though always working,\nsuch a man is never entangled.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nOne who is on the path of liberation by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is very dear to\nevery living being, and every living being is dear to him. This is due to his\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Such a person cannot think of any living being as separate\nfrom K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, just as the leaves and branches of a tree are not separate from the\ntree. He knows very well that by pouring water on the root of the tree, the\nwater will be distributed to all the leaves and branches, or by supplying food\nto the stomach, the energy is automatically distributed throughout the body.\nBecause one who works in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is servant to all, he is very dear\nto everyone. And, because everyone is satisfied by his work, he is pure in\nconsciousness. Because he is pure in consciousness, his mind is completely\ncontrolled. And, because his mind is controlled, his senses are also controlled.\nBecause his mind is always fixed on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, there is no chance of his being\ndeviated from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Nor is there a chance that he will engage his senses in\nmatters other than the service of the Lord. He does not like to hear anything\nexcept topics relating to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; he does not like to eat anything which is not\noffered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; and he does not wish to go anywhere if K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not involved.\nTherefore, his senses are controlled. A man of controlled senses cannot be\noffensive to anyone. One may ask, \u201cWhy then was Arjuna offensive (in battle) to\nothers? Wasn\u2019t he in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness?\u201d Arjuna was only superficially\noffensive because (as has already been explained in the Second Chapter) all the\nassembled persons on the battlefield would continue to live individually, as the\nsoul cannot be slain. So, spiritually, no one was killed on the Battlefield of\nKuruk\u1e63etra. Only their dresses were changed by the order of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who was\npersonally present. Therefore Arjuna, while fighting on the Battlefield of\nKuruk\u1e63etra, was not really fighting at all; he was simply carrying out the\norders of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Such a person is never entangled in\nthe reactions of work.\n\n\n5.8-9\n\n\nnaiva ki\u00f1cit karom\u012bti\n\n\nyukto manyeta tattva-vit\n\n\npa\u015bya\u00f1 \u015b\u1e5b\u1e47van sp\u1e5b\u015ba\u00f1 jighrann\n\n\na\u015bnan gacchan svapan \u015bvasan\n\n\npralapan vis\u1e5bjan g\u1e5bh\u1e47ann\n\n\nunmi\u1e63an nimi\u1e63ann api\n\n\nindriy\u0101\u1e47\u012bndriy\u0101rthe\u1e63u\n\n\nvartanta iti dh\u0101rayan\n\n\nna\u2014never; eva\u2014certainly; ki\u00f1cit\u2014anything; karomi\u2014do I do; iti\u2014thus;\nyukta\u1e25\u2014engaged in the divine consciousness; manyeta\u2014thinks; tattvavit\u2014one who\nknows the truth; pa\u015byan\u2014by seeing; \u015b\u1e5b\u1e47van\u2014by hearing; sp\u1e5b\u015ban\u2014by touching;\njighran\u2014by smelling; a\u015bnan\u2014by eating; gacchan\u2014by going; svapan\u2014by dreaming;\n\u015bvasan\u2014by breathing; pralapan\u2014by talking; vis\u1e5bjan\u2014by giving up; g\u1e5bh\u1e47an\u2014by\naccepting; unmi\u1e63an\u2014opening; nimi\u1e63an\u2014closing; api\u2014in spite of; indriy\u0101\u1e47i\u2014the\nsenses; indriya-arthe\u1e63u\u2014in sense gratification; vartante\u2014let them be so engaged;\niti\u2014thus; dh\u0101rayan\u2014considering.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nA person in the divine consciousness, although engaged in seeing, hearing,\ntouching, smelling, eating, moving about, sleeping, and breathing, always knows\nwithin himself that he actually does nothing at all. Because while speaking,\nevacuating, receiving, opening or closing his eyes, he always knows that only\nthe material senses are engaged with their objects and that he is aloof from\nthem.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nA person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is pure in his existence, and consequently he\nhas nothing to do with any work which depends upon five immediate and remote\ncauses: the doer, the work, the situation, the endeavor and fortune. This is\nbecause he is engaged in the loving transcendental service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Although he\nappears to be acting with his body and senses, he is always conscious of his\nactual position, which is spiritual engagement. In material consciousness, the\nsenses are engaged in sense gratification, but in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness the senses\nare engaged in the satisfaction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s senses. Therefore, the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconscious person is always free, even though he appears to be engaged in things\nof the senses. Activities such as seeing, hearing, speaking, evacuating, etc.,\nare actions of the senses meant for work. A K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness person is never\naffected by the actions of the senses.

The material world is a sum total\nmanifestation of the three modes of material nature, technically called the\npradh\u0101na. The Vedic hymns, sarvam etad brahma, tasm\u0101d etad brahma n\u0101ma-r\u016bpam\nanna\u1e41 ca j\u0101yate, and, in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, mama yonir mahad brahma, indicate\nthat everything in the material world is the manifestation of Brahman; and,\nalthough the effects are differently manifested, they are nondifferent from the\ncause. In the \u012a\u015bopani\u1e63ad it is said that everything is related to the Supreme\nBrahman or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and thus everything belongs to Him only. One who knows\nperfectly well that everything belongs to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, that He is the proprietor of\neverything and that, therefore, everything is engaged in the service of the\nLord, naturally has nothing to do with the results of his activities, whether\nvirtuous or sinful. Even one\u2019s material body, being a gift of the Lord for\ncarrying out a particular type of action, can be engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\nIt is beyond contamination by sinful reactions, exactly as the lotus leaf,\nthough remaining in the water, is not wet. The Lord also says in the G\u012bt\u0101: mayi\nsarv\u0101\u1e47i karm\u0101\u1e47i sannyasya: \u201cResign all works unto Me [K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a].\u201d The conclusion is\nthat a person without K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness acts according to the concept of the\nmaterial body and senses, but a person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness acts according to\nthe knowledge that the body is the property of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and should therefore be\nengaged in the service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\n\n\n5.11\n\n\nk\u0101yena manas\u0101 buddhy\u0101\n\n\nkevalair indriyair api\n\n\nyogina\u1e25 karma kurvanti\n\n\nsa\u1e45ga\u1e41 tyaktv\u0101tma-\u015buddhaye\n\n\nk\u0101yena\u2014with the body; manas\u0101\u2014with the mind; buddhy\u0101\u2014with the intelligence;\nkevalai\u1e25\u2014purified; indriyai\u1e25\u2014with the senses; api\u2014even with; yogina\u1e25\u2014the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconscious persons; karma\u2014actions; kurvanti\u2014they act; sa\u1e45gam\u2014attachment;\ntyaktv\u0101\u2014giving up; \u0101tma\u2014self; \u015buddhaye\u2014for the purpose of purification.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThe yog\u012bs, abandoning attachment, act with body, mind, intelligence, and even\nwith the senses, only for the purpose of purification.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nBy acting in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness for the satisfaction of the senses of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a,\nany action, whether of the body, mind, intelligence or even of the senses, is\npurified of material contamination. There are no material reactions resulting\nfrom the activities of a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person. Therefore, purified activities,\nwhich are generally called sad\u0101c\u0101ra, can be easily performed by acting in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness. \u015ar\u012b R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b in his Bhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu describes this as\nfollows:\n\n\n\u012bh\u0101 yasya harer d\u0101sye karma\u1e47\u0101 manas\u0101 gir\u0101 nikhil\u0101sv apy avasth\u0101su j\u012bvanmukta\u1e25 sa\nucyate\n\n\nA person acting in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness (or, in other words, in the service of\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a) with his body, mind, intelligence and words is a liberated person even\nwithin the material world, although he may be engaged in many so-called material\nactivities. He has no false ego, nor does he believe that he is this material\nbody, nor that he possesses the body. He knows that he is not this body and that\nthis body does not belong to him. He himself belongs to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and the body too\nbelongs to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.

He is one\nwith K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and is devoid of the false ego that leads one to believe that he is\nthe body, etc. This is the perfect stage of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\n\n\n5.12\n\n\nyukta\u1e25 karma-phala\u1e41 tyaktv\u0101\n\n\n\u015b\u0101ntim \u0101pnoti nai\u1e63\u1e6dhik\u012bm\n\n\nayukta\u1e25 k\u0101ma-k\u0101re\u1e47a\n\n\nphale sakto nibadhyate\n\n\nyukta\u1e25\u2014one who is engaged in devotional service; karma-phalam\u2014the results of all\nactivities; tyaktv\u0101\u2014giving up; \u015b\u0101ntim\u2014perfect peace; \u0101pnoti\u2014achieves;\nnai\u1e63\u1e6dhik\u012bm\u2014unflinching; ayukta\u1e25\u2014one who is not in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness;\nk\u0101ma-k\u0101re\u1e47a\u2014for enjoying the result of work; phale\u2014in the result;\nsakta\u1e25\u2014attached; nibadhyate\u2014becomes entangled.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThe steadily devoted soul attains unadulterated peace because he offers the\nresult of all activities to Me; whereas a person who is not in union with the\nDivine, who is greedy for the fruits of his labor, becomes entangled.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe difference between a person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and a person in bodily\nconsciousness is that the former is attached to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, whereas the latter is\nattached to the results of his activities. The person who is attached to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nand works for Him only is certainly a liberated person, and he is not anxious\nfor fruitive rewards. In the Bh\u0101gavatam, the cause of anxiety over the result of\nan activity is explained as being due to one\u2019s functioning in the conception of\nduality, that is, without knowledge of the Absolute Truth. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme\nAbsolute Truth, the Personality of Godhead. In K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, there is no\nduality. All that exists is a product of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s energy, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is all good.\nTherefore, activities in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness are on the absolute plane; they are\ntranscendental and have no material effect. One is, therefore, filled with peace\nin K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. One who is, however, entangled in profit calculation for\nsense gratification cannot have that peace. This is the secret of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness\u2014realization that there is no existence besides K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the\nplatform of peace and fearlessness.\n\n\n5.13\n\n\nsarva-karm\u0101\u1e47i manas\u0101\n\n\nsannyasy\u0101ste sukha\u1e41 va\u015b\u012b\n\n\nnava-dv\u0101re pure deh\u012b\n\n\nnaiva kurvan na k\u0101rayan\n\n\nsarva\u2014all; karm\u0101\u1e47i\u2014activities; manas\u0101\u2014by the mind; sannyasya\u2014giving up;\n\u0101ste\u2014remains; sukham\u2014in happiness; va\u015b\u012b\u2014one who is controlled; nava-dv\u0101re\u2014in the\nplace where there are nine gates; pure\u2014in the city; deh\u012b\u2014the embodied soul;\nna\u2014never; eva\u2014certainly; kurvan\u2014doing anything; na\u2014not; k\u0101rayan\u2014causing to be\ndone.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nWhen the embodied living being controls his nature and mentally renounces all\nactions, he resides happily in the city of nine gates [the material body],\nneither working nor causing work to be done.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe embodied soul lives in the city of nine gates. The activities of the body,\nor the figurative city of body, are conducted automatically by the particular\nmodes of nature. The soul, although subjecting himself to the conditions of the\nbody, can be beyond those conditions, if he so desires. Owing only to\nforgetfulness of his superior nature, he identifies with the material body, and\ntherefore suffers. By K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, he can revive his real position and\nthus come out of his embodiment. Therefore, when one takes to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness, one at once becomes completely aloof from bodily activities. In\nsuch a controlled life, in which his deliberations are changed, he lives happily\nwithin the city of nine gates. The nine gates are described as follows:\n\n\nnava-dv\u0101re pure deh\u012b ha\u1e41so lel\u0101yate bahi\u1e25 va\u015b\u012b sarvasya lokasya sth\u0101varasya\ncarasya ca.\n\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is living within the body of a living\nentity, is the controller of all living entities all over the universe. The body\nconsists of nine gates: two eyes, two nostrils, two ears, one mouth, the anus\nand the genital. The living entity in his conditioned stage identifies himself\nwith the body, but when he identifies himself with the Lord within himself, he\nbecomes just as free as the Lord, even while in the body.\u201d (\u015avet. 3.18)\n\n\nTherefore, a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person is free from both the outer and inner\nactivities of the material body.\n\n\n5.14\n\n\nna kart\u1e5btva\u1e41 na karm\u0101\u1e47i\n\n\nlokasya s\u1e5bjati prabhu\u1e25\n\n\nna karma-phala-sa\u1e41yoga\u1e41\n\n\nsvabh\u0101vas tu pravartate\n\n\nna\u2014never; kart\u1e5btvam\u2014proprietorship; na\u2014nor; karm\u0101\u1e47i\u2014activities; lokasya\u2014of the\npeople; s\u1e5bjati\u2014creates; prabhu\u1e25\u2014the master of the city of the body; na\u2014nor;\nkarma-phala\u2014results of activities; sa\u1e41yogam\u2014connection; svabh\u0101va\u1e25\u2014modes of\nmaterial nature; tu\u2014but; pravartate\u2014acts.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThe embodied spirit, master of the city of his body, does not create activities,\nnor does he induce people to act, nor does he create the fruits of action. All\nthis is enacted by the modes of material nature.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe living entity, as will be explained in the Seventh Chapter, is one in nature\nwith the Supreme Lord, distinguished from matter, which is another nature\u2014called\ninferior\u2014of the Lord. Somehow, the superior nature, the living entity, has been\nin contact with material nature since time immemorial. The temporary body or\nmaterial dwelling place which he obtains is the cause of varieties of activities\nand their resultant reactions. Living in such a conditional atmosphere, one\nsuffers the results of the activities of the body by identifying himself (in\nignorance) with the body. It is ignorance acquired from time immemorial that is\nthe cause of bodily suffering and distress. As soon as the living entity becomes\naloof from the activities of the body, he becomes free from the reactions as\nwell. As long as he is in the city of body, he appears to be the master of it,\nbut actually he is neither its proprietor nor controller of its actions and\nreactions. He is simply in the midst of the material ocean, struggling for\nexistence. The waves of the ocean are tossing him, and he has no control over\nthem. His best solution is to get out of the water by transcendental K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness. That alone will save him from all turmoil.\n\n\n5.15\n\n\nn\u0101datte kasyacit p\u0101pa\u1e41\n\n\nna caiva suk\u1e5bta\u1e41 vibhu\u1e25\n\n\naj\u00f1\u0101nen\u0101v\u1e5bta\u1e41 j\u00f1\u0101na\u1e41\n\n\ntena muhyanti jantava\u1e25\n\n\nna\u2014never; \u0101datte\u2014accepts; kasyacit\u2014anyone\u2019s; p\u0101pam\u2014sin; na\u2014nor; ca\u2014also;\neva\u2014certainly; suk\u1e5btam\u2014pious activities; vibhu\u1e25\u2014the Supreme Lord; aj\u00f1\u0101nena\u2014by\nignorance; \u0101v\u1e5btam\u2014covered; j\u00f1\u0101nam\u2014knowledge; tena\u2014by that; muhyanti\u2014bewildered;\njantava\u1e25\u2014the living entities.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nNor does the Supreme Spirit assume anyone\u2019s sinful or pious activities. Embodied\nbeings, however, are bewildered because of the ignorance which covers their real\nknowledge.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe Sanskrit word vibhu\u1e25 means the Supreme Lord who is full of unlimited\nknowledge, riches, strength, fame, beauty and renunciation. He is always\nsatisfied in Himself, undisturbed by sinful or pious activities. He does not\ncreate a particular situation for any living entity, but the living entity,\nbewildered by ignorance, desires to be put into certain conditions of life, and\nthereby his chain of action and reaction begins. A living entity is, by superior\nnature, full of knowledge. Nevertheless, he is prone to be influenced by\nignorance due to his limited power. The Lord is omnipotent, but the living\nentity is not. The Lord is vibhu, or omniscient, but the living entity is a\u1e47u,\nor atomic. Because he is a living soul, he has the capacity to desire by his\nfree will. Such desire is fulfilled only by the omnipotent Lord. And so, when\nthe living entity is bewildered in his desires, the Lord allows him to fulfill\nthose desires, but the Lord is never responsible for the actions and reactions\nof the particular situation which may be desired. Being in a bewildered\ncondition, therefore, the embodied soul identifies himself with the\ncircumstantial material body and becomes subjected to the temporary misery and\nhappiness of life. The Lord is the constant companion of the living entity as\nParam\u0101tm\u0101, or the Supersoul, and therefore He can understand the desires of the\nindividual soul, as one can smell the flavor of a flower by being near it.\nDesire is a subtle form of conditioning of the living entity. The Lord fulfills\nhis desire as he deserves: Man proposes and God disposes. The individual is not,\ntherefore, omnipotent in fulfilling his desires. The Lord, however, can fulfill\nall desires, and the Lord, being neutral to everyone, does not interfere with\nthe desires of the minute independant living entities. However, when one desires\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Lord takes special care and encourages one to desire in such a way\nthat one can attain to Him and be eternally happy. The Vedic hymn therefore\ndeclares:\n\n\ne\u1e63a u hy eva s\u0101dhu karma k\u0101rayati ta\u1e41 yamebhyo lokebhya unnin\u012b\u1e63ate e\u1e63a u\nev\u0101s\u0101dhu karma k\u0101rayati yamadho nin\u012b\u1e63ate.\n\n\naj\u00f1o jantur an\u012bso \u2019yam \u0101tmana\u1e25 sukha-du\u1e25khayo\u1e25 \u012b\u015bvara-prerito gacchet svarga\u1e41\nv\u0101\u015bvabhram eva ca.\n\n\n\u201cThe Lord engages the living entity in pious activities so he may be elevated.\nThe Lord engages him in impious activities so he may go to hell. The living\nentity is completely dependant in his distress and happiness. By the will of the\nSupreme he can go to heaven or hell, as a cloud is driven by the air.\u201d\n\n\nTherefore the embodied soul, by his immemorial desire to avoid K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness, causes his own bewilderment. Consequently, although he is\nconstitutionally eternal, blissful and cognizant, due to the littleness of his\nexistence he forgets his constitutional position of service to the Lord and is\nthus entrapped by nescience. And, under the spell of ignorance, the living\nentity claims that the Lord is responsible for his conditional existence. The\nVed\u0101nta-s\u016btras also confirm this:\n\n\nvai\u1e63amya-nairgh\u1e5b\u1e47ye na s\u0101pek\u1e63atv\u0101t tath\u0101 hi dar\u015bayati.\n\n\n\u201cThe Lord neither hates nor likes anyone, though He appears to.\u201d\n\n\n5.16\n\n\nj\u00f1\u0101nena tu tad aj\u00f1\u0101na\u1e41\n\n\nye\u1e63\u0101\u1e41 n\u0101\u015bitam \u0101tmana\u1e25\n\n\nte\u1e63\u0101m \u0101ditya-vaj j\u00f1\u0101na\u1e41\n\n\nprak\u0101\u015bayati tat param\n\n\nj\u00f1\u0101nena\u2014by knowledge; tu\u2014but; tat\u2014that; aj\u00f1\u0101nam\u2014nescience; ye\u1e63\u0101m\u2014of those;\nn\u0101\u015bitam\u2014is destroyed; \u0101tmana\u1e25\u2014of the living entity; te\u1e63\u0101m\u2014of their;\n\u0101dityavat\u2014like the rising sun; j\u00f1\u0101nam\u2014knowledge; prak\u0101\u015bayati\u2014discloses; tat\nparam\u2014in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nWhen, however, one is enlightened with the knowledge by which nescience is\ndestroyed, then his knowledge reveals everything, as the sun lights up\neverything in the daytime.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThose who have forgotten K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a must certainly be bewildered, but those who are\nin K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness are not bewildered at all. It is stated in the\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, \u201csarva\u1e41 j\u00f1\u0101na-plavena,\u201d \u201cj\u00f1\u0101n\u0101gni\u1e25 sarva-karm\u0101\u1e47i\u201d and \u201cna hi\nj\u00f1\u0101nena sad\u1e5b\u015bam.\u201d Knowledge is always highly esteemed. And what is that\nknowledge? Perfect knowledge is achieved when one surrenders unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, as is\nsaid in the Seventh Chapter, 19th verse: bah\u016bn\u0101\u1e41 janman\u0101m ante j\u00f1\u0101nav\u0101n m\u0101\u1e41\nprapadyate. After passing through many, many births, when one perfect in\nknowledge surrenders unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or when one attains K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, then\neverything is revealed to him, as the sun reveals everything in the daytime. The\nliving entity is bewildered in so many ways. For instance, when he thinks\nhimself God, unceremoniously, he actually falls into the last snare of\nnescience. If a living entity is God, then how can he become bewildered by\nnescience? Does God become bewildered by nescience? If so, then nescience, or\nSatan, is greater than God. Real knowledge can be obtained from a person who is\nin perfect K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Therefore, one has to seek out such a bona fide\nspiritual master and, under him, learn what K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is. The\nspiritual master can drive away all nescience, as the sun drives away darkness.\nEven though a person may be in full knowledge that he is not this body but is\ntranscendental to the body, he still may not be able to discriminate between the\nsoul and the Supersoul. However, he can know everything well if he cares to take\nshelter of the perfect, bona fide K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious spiritual master. One can know\nGod and one\u2019s relationship with God only when one actually meets a\nrepresentative of God. A representative of God never claims that he is God,\nalthough he is paid all the respect ordinarily paid to God because he has\nknowledge of God. One has to learn the distinction between God and the living\nentity. Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a therefore stated in the Second Chapter (2.12) that every\nliving being is individual and that the Lord also is individual.

The whole Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 centers\naround the declaration of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That is\nthe version of all Vedic literature. Paratattva means the Supreme Reality, who\nis understood by the knowers of the Supreme as Brahman, Param\u0101tm\u0101 and Bhagav\u0101n.\nBhagav\u0101n, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the last word in the\nAbsolute. There is nothing more than that.TheLord says, matta\u1e25 paratara\u1e41 n\u0101nyat\nki\u00f1cit asti dhana\u00f1jaya. Impersonal Brahman is also supported by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a: brahma\u1e47o\nprati\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101ham. Therefore in all ways K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Reality. One whose\nmind, intelligence, faith and refuge are always in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or, in other words,\none who is fully in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, is undoubtedly washed clean of all\nmisgivings and is in perfect knowledge in everything concerning transcendence. A\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person can thoroughly understand that there is duality\n(simultaneous identity and individuality) in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and, equipped with such\ntranscendental knowledge, one can make steady progress on the path of\nliberation.\n\n\n5.18\n\n\nvidy\u0101-vinaya-sampanne\n\n\nbr\u0101hma\u1e47e gavi hastini\n\n\n\u015buni caiva \u015bva-p\u0101ke ca\n\n\npa\u1e47\u1e0dit\u0101\u1e25 sama-dar\u015bina\u1e25\n\n\nvidy\u0101\u2014education; vinaya\u2014gentleness; sampanne\u2014fully equipped; br\u0101hma\u1e47e\u2014in the\nbr\u0101hma\u1e47a; gavi\u2014in the cow; hastini\u2014in the elephant; \u015buni\u2014in the dog; ca\u2014and;\neva\u2014certainly; \u015bvap\u0101ke\u2014in the dog-eater (the outcaste); ca\u2014respectively;\npa\u1e47\u1e0dit\u0101\u1e25\u2014those who are so wise; sama-dar\u015bina\u1e25\u2014do see with equal vision.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThe humble sage, by virtue of true knowledge, sees with equal vision a learned\nand gentle br\u0101hma\u1e47a, a cow, an elephant, a dog and a dog-eater [outcaste] .\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nA K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person does not make any distinction between species or\ncastes. The br\u0101hma\u1e47a and the outcaste may be different from the social point of\nview, or a dog, a cow, or an elephant may be different from the point of view of\nspecies, but these differences of body are meaningless from the viewpoint of a\nlearned transcendentalist. This is due to their relationship to the Supreme, for\nthe Supreme Lord, by His plenary portion as Param\u0101tm\u0101, is present in everyone\u2019s\nheart. Such an understanding of the Supreme is real knowledge. As far as the\nbodies are concerned in different castes or different species of life, the Lord\nis equally kind to everyone because He treats every living being as a friend yet\nmaintains Himself as Param\u0101tm\u0101 regardless of the circumstances of the living\nentities. The Lord as Param\u0101tm\u0101 is present both in the outcaste and in the\nbr\u0101hma\u1e47a, although the body of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a and that of an outcaste are not the\nsame. The bodies are material productions of different modes of material nature,\nbut the soul and the Supersoul within the body are of the same spiritual\nquality. The similarity in the quality of the soul and the Supersoul, however,\ndoes not make them equal in quantity, for the individual soul is present only in\nthat particular body, whereas the Param\u0101tm\u0101 is present in each and every body. A\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person has full knowledge of this, and therefore he is truly\nlearned and has equal vision. The similar characteristics of the soul and\nSupersoul are that they are both conscious, eternal and blissful. But the\ndifference is that the individual soul is conscious within the limited\njurisdiction of the body, whereas the Supersoul is conscious of all bodies. The\nSupersoul is present in all bodies without distinction.\n\n\n5.19\n\n\nihaiva tair jita\u1e25 sargo\n\n\nye\u1e63\u0101\u1e41 s\u0101mye sthita\u1e41 mana\u1e25\n\n\nnirdo\u1e63a\u1e41 hi sama\u1e41 brahma\n\n\ntasm\u0101d brahma\u1e47i te sthit\u0101\u1e25\n\n\niha\u2014in this life; eva\u2014certainly; tai\u1e25\u2014by them; jita\u1e25\u2014conquered; sarga\u1e25\u2014birth and\ndeath; ye\u1e63\u0101m\u2014of those; s\u0101mye\u2014in equanimity; sthitam\u2014so situated; mana\u1e25\u2014mind;\nnirdo\u1e63am\u2014flawless; hi\u2014certainly; samam\u2014in equanimity; brahma\u2014the Supreme;\ntasm\u0101t\u2014therefore; brahma\u1e47i\u2014in the Supreme; te\u2014they; sthit\u0101\u1e25\u2014are situated.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThose whose minds are established in sameness and equanimity have already\nconquered the conditions of birth and death.

Those\nwho have actually attained to such a stage should be considered to have\nconquered material conditions, specifically birth and death. As long as one\nidentifies with this body, he is considered a conditioned soul, but as soon as\nhe is elevated to the stage of equanimity through realization of self, he is\nliberated from conditional life. In other words, he is no longer subject to take\nbirth in the material world but can enter into the spiritual sky after his\ndeath. The Lord is flawless because He is without attraction or hatred.\nSimilarly, when a living entity is without attraction or hatred, he also becomes\nflawless and eligible to enter into the spiritual sky.

The first symptom is\nthat he is not illusioned by the false identification of the body with his true\nself. He knows perfectly well that he is not this body, but is the fragmental\nport~on of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is therefore not joyful in\nachieving something, nor does he lament in losing anything which is related to\nhis body. This steadiness of mind is called sthira-buddhi, or self-intelligence.\nHe is therefore never bewildered by mistaking the gross body for the soul, nor\ndoes he accept the body as permanent and disregard the existence of the soul.\nThis knowledge elevates him to the station of knowing the complete science of\nthe Absolute Truth, namely Brahman, Param\u0101tm\u0101 and Bhagav\u0101n. He thus knows his\nconstitutional position perfectly well, without falsely trying to become one\nwith the Supreme in all respects. This is called Brahman realization, or\nself-realization. Such steady consciousness is called K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\n\n\n5.21\n\n\nb\u0101hya-spar\u015be\u1e63v asakt\u0101tm\u0101\n\n\nvindaty \u0101tmani yat sukham\n\n\nsa brahma-yoga-yukt\u0101tm\u0101\n\n\nsukham ak\u1e63ayam a\u015bnute\n\n\nb\u0101hya-spar\u015be\u1e63u\u2014in external sense pleasure; asakta-\u0101tm\u0101\u2014one who is not so\nattached; vindati\u2014enjoys; \u0101tmani\u2014in the self; yat\u2014that which; sukham\u2014happiness;\nsa\u1e25\u2014that; brahma-yoga\u2014concentrated in Brahman; yukta-\u0101tm\u0101\u2014self-connected;\nsukham\u2014happiness; ak\u1e63ayam\u2014unlimited; a\u015bnute\u2014enjoys.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nSuch a liberated person is not attracted to material sense pleasure or external\nobjects but is always in trance, enjoying the pleasure within.

Such gosv\u0101m\u012bs live\nstrictly controlled lives, and forego altogether the forces of the senses.\nMaterial desires, when unsatiated, generate anger, and thus the mind, eyes and\nchest become agitated.

One cannot be engaged in first-class welfare work\nwithout being liberated in the Supreme. A K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person has no doubt\nabout the supremacy of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.

Temporary relief of the external body and the mind\nis not satisfactory. The real cause of one\u2019s difficulties in the hard struggle\nfor life may be found in one\u2019s forgetfulness of his relationship with the\nSupreme Lord. When a man is fully conscious of his relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he\nis actually a liberated soul, although he may be in the material tabernacle.\n\n\n5.26\n\n\nk\u0101ma-krodha-vimukt\u0101n\u0101\u1e41\n\n\nyat\u012bn\u0101\u1e41 yata-cetas\u0101m\n\n\nabhito brahma-nirv\u0101\u1e47a\u1e41\n\n\nvartate vidit\u0101tman\u0101m\n\n\nk\u0101ma\u2014desires; krodha\u2014anger; vimukt\u0101n\u0101m\u2014of those who are so liberated; yat\u012bn\u0101m\u2014of\nthe saintly persons; yata-cetas\u0101m\u2014of persons who have full control over the\nmind; abhita\u1e25\u2014assured in the near future; brahma-nirv\u0101\u1e47am\u2014liberation in the\nSupreme; vartate\u2014is there; vidita-\u0101tman\u0101m\u2014of those who are self-realized.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThose who are free from anger and all material desires, who are selfrealized,\nself-disciplined and constantly endeavoring for perfection, are assured of\nliberation in the Supreme in the very near future.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nOf the saintly persons who are constantly engaged in striving toward salvation,\none who is in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is the best of all. The Bh\u0101gavatam confirms\nthis fact as follows:\n\n\nyat-p\u0101da-pa\u1e45kaja-pal\u0101\u015ba-vil\u0101sa-bhakty\u0101 karm\u0101\u015baya\u1e41 grathitam udgrathayanti santa\u1e25\ntadvan na rikta-matayo yatayo \u2019pi ruddha- srotoga\u1e47\u0101s tam ara\u1e47a\u1e41 bhaja v\u0101sudevam.\n\n\n\u201cJust try to worship, in devotional service, V\u0101sudeva, the Supreme Personality\nof Godhead. Even great sages are not able to control the forces of the senses as\neffectively as those who are engaged in transcendental bliss by serving the\nlotus feet of the Lord, uprooting the deep grown desire for fruitive\nactivities.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 4.22.39)\n\n\nIn the conditioned soul the desire to enjoy the fruitive results of work is so\ndeep-rooted that it is very difficult even for the great sages to control such\ndesires, despite great endeavors. A devotee of the Lord, constantly engaged in\ndevotional service in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, perfect in self-realization, very\nquickly attains liberation in the Supreme. Owing to his complete knowledge in\nself-realization, he always remains in trance. To cite an analagous example of\nthis:\n\n\ndar\u015bana-dhy\u0101na-sa\u1e41spar\u015bair matsya-k\u016brma-viha\u1e45gam\u0101\u1e25 sv\u0101nya paty\u0101ni pu\u1e63\u1e47anti\ntath\u0101ham api padmaja.\n\n\n\u201cBy vision, by meditation and by touch only do the fish, the tortoise and the\nbirds maintain their offspring. Similarly do I also, O Padmaja!\u201d\n\n\nThe fish brings up its offspring simply by looking at them. The tortoise brings\nup its offspring simply by meditation. The eggs of the tortoise are laid on\nland, and the tortoise meditates on the eggs while in the water. Similarly, a\ndevotee in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, although far away from the Lord\u2019s abode, can\nelevate himself to that abode simply by thinking of Him constantly\u2014by engagement\nin K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. He does not feel the pangs of material miseries; this\nstate of life is called brahma-nirv\u0101\u1e47a, or the absence of material miseries due\nto being constantly immersed in the Supreme.\n\n\n5.27-28\n\n\nspar\u015b\u0101n k\u1e5btv\u0101 bahir b\u0101hy\u0101\u1e41\u015b\n\n\ncak\u1e63u\u015b caiv\u0101ntare bhruvo\u1e25\n\n\npr\u0101\u1e47\u0101p\u0101nau samau k\u1e5btv\u0101\n\n\nn\u0101s\u0101bhyantara-c\u0101ri\u1e47au\n\n\nyatendriya-mano-buddhir\n\n\nmunir mok\u1e63a-par\u0101ya\u1e47a\u1e25\n\n\nvigatecch\u0101-bhaya-krodho\n\n\nya\u1e25 sad\u0101 mukta eva sa\u1e25\n\n\nspar\u015b\u0101n\u2014external sense objects, such as sound, etc.; k\u1e5btv\u0101\u2014doing so;\nbahi\u1e25\u2014external; b\u0101hy\u0101n\u2014unnecessary; cak\u1e63u\u1e25\u2014eyes; ca\u2014also; eva\u2014certainly;\nantare\u2014within; bhruvo\u1e25\u2014of the eyebrows; pr\u0101\u1e47a-ap\u0101nau\u2014up-and down-moving air;\nsamau\u2014in suspension; k\u1e5btv\u0101\u2014doing so; n\u0101s\u0101-abhyantara\u2014within the nostrils;\nc\u0101ri\u1e47au\u2014blowing; yata\u2014controlled; indriya\u2014senses; mana\u1e25\u2014mind;\nbuddhih\u2014intelligence; muni\u1e25\u2014the transcendentalist; mok\u1e63a\u2014liberation;\npar\u0101ya\u1e47a\u1e25\u2014being so destined; vigata\u2014discarded; icch\u0101\u2014wishes; bhaya\u2014fear;\nkrodha\u1e25\u2014anger; ya\u1e25\u2014one who; sad\u0101\u2014always; mukta\u1e25\u2014liberated; eva\u2014certainly; sa\u1e25\u2014he\nis.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nShutting out all external sense objects, keeping the eyes and vision\nconcentrated between the two eyebrows, suspending the inward and outward breaths\nwithin the nostrils\u2014thus controlling the mind, senses and intelligence, the\ntranecendentalist becomes free from desire, fear and anger. One who is always in\nthis state is certainly liberated.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nBeing engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, one can immediately understand one\u2019s\nspiritual identity, and then one can understand the Supreme Lord by means of\ndevotional service. When he is well situated in devotional service, one comes to\nthe transcendental position, qualified to feel the presence of the Lord in the\nsphere of one\u2019s activity. This particular position is called liberation in the\nSupreme.\n\n\nAfter explaining the above principles of liberation in the Supreme, the Lord\ngives instruction to Arjuna as to how one can come to that position by the\npractice of mysticism or yoga, known as a\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45ga-yoga, which is divisible into an\neightfold procedure called yama, niyama, \u0101sana, pr\u0101\u1e47\u0101y\u0101ma, praty\u0101h\u0101ra, dh\u0101ra\u1e47\u0101,\ndhy\u0101na, and sam\u0101dhi. In the Sixth Chapter the subject of yoga is explicitly\ndetailed, and at the end of the Fifth it is only preliminarily explained. One\nhas to drive out the sense objects such as sound, touch, form, taste and smell\nby the praty\u0101h\u0101ra (breathing) process in yoga, and then keep the vision of the\neyes between the two eyebrows and concentrate on the tip of the nose with half\nclosed lids. There is no benefit in closing the eyes altogether, because then\nthere is every chance of falling asleep. Nor is there benefit in opening the\neyes completely, because then there is the hazard of being attracted by sense\nobjects. The breathing movement is restrained within the nostrils by\nneutralizing the up- and down-moving air within the body. By practice of such\nyoga one is able to gain control over the senses, refrain from outward sense\nobjects, and thus prepare oneself for liberation in the Supreme.\n\n\nThis yoga process helps one become free from all kinds of fear and anger and\nthus feel the presence of the Supersoul in the transcendental situation. In\nother words, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is the easiest process of executing yoga\nprinciples. This will be thoroughly explained in the next chapter. A K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconscious person, however, being always engaged in devotional service, does not\nrisk losing his senses to some other engagement. This is a better way of\ncontrolling the senses than by the a\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45ga-yoga.\n\n\n5.29\n\n\nbhokt\u0101ra\u1e41 yaj\u00f1a-tapas\u0101\u1e41\n\n\nsarva-loka-mahe\u015bvaram\n\n\nsuh\u1e5bda\u1e41 sarva-bh\u016bt\u0101n\u0101\u1e41\n\n\nj\u00f1\u0101tv\u0101 m\u0101\u1e41 \u015b\u0101ntim \u1e5bcchati\n\n\nbhokt\u0101ram\u2014beneficiary; yaj\u00f1a\u2014sacrifices; tapas\u0101m\u2014of penances and austerities;\nsarva-loka\u2014all planets and the demigods thereof; mahe\u015bvaram\u2014the Supreme Lord;\nsuh\u1e5bdam\u2014benefactor; sarva\u2014all; bh\u016bt\u0101n\u0101m\u2014of the living entities; j\u00f1\u0101tv\u0101\u2014thus\nknowing; m\u0101m\u2014Me (Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a); \u015b\u0101ntim\u2014relief from material pangs;\n\u1e5bcchati\u2014achieves.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThe sages, knowing Me as the ultimate purpose of all sacrifices and austerities,\nthe Supreme Lord of all planets and demigods and the benefactor and well-wisher\nof all living entities, attain peace from the pangs of material miseries.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe conditioned souls within the clutches of illusory energy are all anxious to\nattain peace in the material world. But they do not know the formula for peace,\nwhich is explained in this part of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. The greatest peace formula\nis simply this: Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the beneficiary in all human activities. Men\nshould offer everything to the transcendental service of the Lord because He is\nthe proprietor of all planets and the demigods thereon. No one is greater than\nHe. He is greater than the greatest of the demigods, Lord \u015aiva and Lord Brahm\u0101.\nIn the Vedas the Supreme Lord is described as tam \u012b\u015bvar\u0101\u1e47\u0101\u1e41 parama\u1e41 mahe\u015bvaram.\nUnder the spell of illusion, living entities are trying to be lords of all they\nsurvey, but actually they are dominated by the material energy of the Lord. The\nLord is the master of material nature, and the conditioned souls are under the\nstringent rules of material nature. Unless one understands these bare facts, it\nis not possible to achieve peace in the world either individually or\ncollectively. This is the sense of Kssna consciousness: Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the\nsupreme predominator, and all living entities, including the great demigods, are\nHis subordinates. One can attain perfect peace only in complete K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness.\n\n\nThis Fifth Chapter is a practical explanation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, generally\nknown as karma-yoga. The question of mental speculation as to how karma-yoga can\ngive liberation is answered herewith. To work in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is to work\nwith the complete knowledge of the Lord as the predominator. Such work is not\ndifferent from transcendental knowledge. Direct K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is\nbhakti-yoga, and j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga is a path leading to bhakti-yoga. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness means to work in full knowledge of one\u2019s relationship with the\nSupreme Absolute, and the perfection of this consciousness is full knowledge of\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead. A pure soul is the eternal servant\nof God as His fragmental part and parcel. He comes into contact with m\u0101y\u0101\n(illusion) due to the desire to lord it over m\u0101y\u0101, and that is the cause of his\nmany sufferings. As long as he is in contact with matter, he has to execute work\nin terms of material necessities. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, however, brings one into\nspiritual life even while one is within the jurisdiction of matter, for it is an\narousing of spiritual existence by practice in the material world. The more one\nis advanced, the more he is freed from the clutches of matter. The Lord is not\npartial toward anyone. Everything depends on one\u2019s practical performance of\nduties in an effort to control the senses and conquer the influence of desire\nand anger. And, attaining K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness by controlling the above-mentioned\npassions, one remains factually in the transcendental stage, or brahman-nirv\u0101\u1e47a.\nThe eightfold yoga mysticism is automatically practiced in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness\nbecause the ultimate purpose is served. There is gradual process of elevation in\nthe practice of yama, niyama, \u0101sana, praty\u0101h\u0101ra, dhy\u0101na, dh\u0101ra\u1e47\u0101, pr\u0101\u1e47\u0101y\u0101ma, and\nsam\u0101dhi. But these only preface perfection by devotional service, which alone\ncan award peace to the human being. It is the highest perfection of life.",

Now will You kindly tell me definitely which\nof the two is more beneficial?  PURPORT  In this Fifth Chapter of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, the Lord says that work in\ndevotional service is better than dry mental speculation. Devotional service is\neasier than the latter because, being transcendental in nature, it frees one\nfrom reaction. In the Second Chapter, preliminary knowledge of the soul and its\nentanglement in the material body were explained. How to get out of this\nmaterial encagement by buddhi-yoga, or devotional service, was also explained\ntherein. In the Third Chapter, it was explained that a person who is situated on\nthe platform of knowledge no longer has any duties to perform. And, in the\nFourth Chapter, the Lord told Arjuna that all kinds of sacrificial work\nculminate in knowledge. However, at the end of the Fourth Chapter, the Lord\nadvised Arjuna to wake up and fight, being situated in perfect knowledge.\nTherefore, by simultaneously stressing the importance of both work in devotion\nand inaction in knowledge, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has perplexed Arjuna and confused his\ndetermination. Arjuna understands that renunciation in knowledge involves\ncessation of all kinds of work performed as sense activities. But if one\nperforms work in devotional service, then how is work stopped? In other words,\nhe thinks that sanny\u0101sam, or renunciation in knowledge, should be altogether\nfree from all kinds of activity because work and renunciation appear to him to\nbe incompatible. He appears not to have understood that work in full knowledge\nis nonreactive and is therefore the same as inaction. He inquires, therefore,\nwhether he should cease work altogether, or work with full knowledge.",

TRANSLATION  The Blessed Lord said: The renunciation of work and work in devotion are both\ngood for liberation. But, of the two, work in devotional service is better than\nrenunciation of works.  PURPORT  Fruitive activities (seeking sense gratification) are cause for material\nbondage. As long as one is engaged in activities aimed at improving the standard\nof bodily comfort, one is sure to transmigrate to different types of bodies,\nthereby continuing material bondage perpetually. \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam confirms this\nas follows:  n\u016bna\u1e41 pramatta\u1e25 kurute vikarma yad indriya-pr\u012btaya \u0101p\u1e5b\u1e47oti na s\u0101dhu manye yata\n\u0101tmano \u2019yam asann api kle\u015bada \u0101sa deha\u1e25  par\u0101bhavas t\u0101vad abodha-j\u0101to y\u0101vanna jij\u00f1\u0101sata \u0101tma-tattvam y\u0101vat kriy\u0101s t\u0101vad\nida\u1e41 mano vai karm\u0101tmaka\u1e41 yena \u015bar\u012bra-bandha\u1e25  eva\u1e41 mana\u1e25 karma-va\u015ba\u1e41 prayu\u1e45kte avidyay\u0101tmany upadh\u012byam\u0101ne pr\u012btir na y\u0101van mayi\nv\u0101sudeve na mucyate deha-yogena t\u0101vat  \u201cPeople are mad after sense gratification, and they do not know that this\npresent body, which is full of miseries, is a result of one\u2019s fruitive\nactivities in the past. Although this body is temporary, it is always giving one\ntrouble in many ways. Therefore, to act for sense gratification is not good. One\nis considered to be a failure in life as long as he makes no inquiry about the\nnature of work for fruitive results, for as long as one is engrossed in the\nconsciousness of sense gratification, one has to transmigrate from one body to\nanother. Although the mind may be engrossed in fruitive activities and\ninfluenced by ignorance, one must develop a love for devotional service to\nV\u0101sudeva. Only then can one have the opportunity to get out of the bondage of\nmaterial existence.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 5.5.4-6)  Therefore, j\u00f1\u0101na (or knowledge that one is not this material body but spirit\nsoul) is not sufficient for liberation. One has to act in the status of spirit\nsoul, otherwise there is no escape from material bondage. Action in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness is not, however, action on the fruitive platform. Activities\nperformed in full knowledge strengthen one\u2019s advancement in real knowledge.\nWithout K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, mere renunciation of fruitive activities does not\nactually purify the heart of a conditioned soul. As long as the heart is not\npurified, one has to work on the fruitive platform. But action in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness automatically helps one escape the result of fruitive action so\nthat one need not descend to the material platform. Therefore, action in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness is always superior to renunciation, which always entails a risk of\nfalling. Renunciation without K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is incomplete, as is confirmed\nby \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b in his Bhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu.  pr\u0101pa\u00f1cikatay\u0101 buddhy\u0101 hari-sambandhi-vastuna\u1e25 mumuk\u1e63ubhi\u1e25 parity\u0101go vair\u0101gya\u1e41\nphalgu kathyate.  \u201cRenunciation by persons eager to achieve liberation of things which are related\nto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, though they are material, is called\nincomplete renunciation.\u201d Renunciation is compete when it is in the knowledge\nthat everything in existence belongs to the Lord and that no one should claim\nproprietorship over anything. One should understand that, factually, nothing\nbelongs to anyone. Then where is the question of renunciation? One who knows\nthat everything is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s property is always situated in renunciation. Since\neverything belongs to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, everything should be employed in the service of\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.

The concept of oneness with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is incorrect because\nthe part cannot be equal to the whole. Knowledge that one is one in quality yet\ndifferent in quantity is correct transcendental knowledge leading one to become\nfull in himself, having nothing to aspire to nor lament over. There is no\nduality in his mind because whatever he does, he does for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Being thus\nfreed from the platform of dualities, he is liberated\u2014even in this material\nworld.",

By s\u0101\u1e45khya philosophical\nresearch one comes to the conclusion that a living entity is not a part and\nparcel of the material world, but of the supreme spirit whole. Consequently, the\nspirit soul has nothing to do with the material world; his actions must be in\nsome relation with the Supreme. When he acts in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, he is\nactually in his constitutional position. In the first process of s\u0101\u1e45khya, one\nhas to become detached from matter, and in the devotional yoga process one has\nto attach himself to the work of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Factually, both processes are the same,\nalthough superficially one process appears to involve detachment and the other\nprocess appears to involve attachment.

TRANSLATION  Unless one is engaged in the devotional service of the Lord, mere renunciation\nof activities cannot make one happy. The sages, purified by works of devotion,\nachieve the Supreme without delay.  PURPORT  There are two classes of sanny\u0101s\u012bs, or persons in the renounced order of life.\nThe M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b sanny\u0101s\u012bs are engaged in the study of s\u0101\u1e45khya philosophy, whereas\nthe Vaisnava sanny\u0101s\u012bs are engaged in the study of Bh\u0101gavatam philosophy, which\naffords the proper commentary on the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btras. The M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b sanny\u0101s\u012bs also\nstudy the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btras, but use their own commentary, called \u015a\u0101r\u012braka-bh\u0101\u1e63ya,\nwritten by \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101c\u0101rya. The students of the Bh\u0101gavata school are engaged in\ndevotional service of the Lord, according to p\u0101\u00f1car\u0101trik\u012b regulations, and\ntherefore the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava sanny\u0101s\u012bs have multiple engagements in the transcendental\nservice of the Lord. The Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava sanny\u0101s\u012bs have nothing to do with material\nactivities, and yet they perform various activities in their devotional service\nto the Lord. But the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b sanny\u0101s\u012bs, engaged in the studies of s\u0101\u1e45khya and\nVed\u0101nta and speculation, cannot relish transcendental service of the Lord.\nBecause their studies become very tedious, they sometimes become tired of\nBrahman speculation, and thus they take shelter of the Bh\u0101gavatam without proper\nunderstanding. Consequently their study of the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam becomes\ntroublesome. Dry speculations and impersonal interpretations by artificial means\nare all useless for the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b sanny\u0101s\u012bs. The Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava sanny\u0101s\u012bs, who are\nengaged in devotional service, are happy in the discharge of their\ntranscendental duties, and they have the guarantee of ultimate entrance into the\nkingdom of God. The M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b sanny\u0101s\u012bs sometimes fall down from the path of\nself-realization and again enter into material activities of a philanthropic and\naltruistic nature, which are nothing but material engagements. Therefore, the\nconclusion is that those who are engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness are better\nsituated than the sanny\u0101s\u012bs engaged in simple Brahman speculation, although they\ntoo come to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, after many births.",

PURPORT  One who is on the path of liberation by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is very dear to\nevery living being, and every living being is dear to him. This is due to his\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Such a person cannot think of any living being as separate\nfrom K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, just as the leaves and branches of a tree are not separate from the\ntree. He knows very well that by pouring water on the root of the tree, the\nwater will be distributed to all the leaves and branches, or by supplying food\nto the stomach, the energy is automatically distributed throughout the body.\nBecause one who works in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is servant to all, he is very dear\nto everyone. And, because everyone is satisfied by his work, he is pure in\nconsciousness. Because he is pure in consciousness, his mind is completely\ncontrolled. And, because his mind is controlled, his senses are also controlled.\nBecause his mind is always fixed on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, there is no chance of his being\ndeviated from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Nor is there a chance that he will engage his senses in\nmatters other than the service of the Lord. He does not like to hear anything\nexcept topics relating to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; he does not like to eat anything which is not\noffered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; and he does not wish to go anywhere if K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not involved.\nTherefore, his senses are controlled. A man of controlled senses cannot be\noffensive to anyone. One may ask, \u201cWhy then was Arjuna offensive (in battle) to\nothers? Wasn\u2019t he in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness?\u201d Arjuna was only superficially\noffensive because (as has already been explained in the Second Chapter) all the\nassembled persons on the battlefield would continue to live individually, as the\nsoul cannot be slain. So, spiritually, no one was killed on the Battlefield of\nKuruk\u1e63etra. Only their dresses were changed by the order of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who was\npersonally present. Therefore Arjuna, while fighting on the Battlefield of\nKuruk\u1e63etra, was not really fighting at all; he was simply carrying out the\norders of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Such a person is never entangled in\nthe reactions of work.",

This is\nbecause he is engaged in the loving transcendental service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Although he\nappears to be acting with his body and senses, he is always conscious of his\nactual position, which is spiritual engagement. In material consciousness, the\nsenses are engaged in sense gratification, but in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness the senses\nare engaged in the satisfaction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s senses. Therefore, the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconscious person is always free, even though he appears to be engaged in things\nof the senses. Activities such as seeing, hearing, speaking, evacuating, etc.,\nare actions of the senses meant for work. A K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness person is never\naffected by the actions of the senses.

PURPORT  Here brahma\u1e47i means in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. The material world is a sum total\nmanifestation of the three modes of material nature, technically called the\npradh\u0101na. The Vedic hymns, sarvam etad brahma, tasm\u0101d etad brahma n\u0101ma-r\u016bpam\nanna\u1e41 ca j\u0101yate, and, in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, mama yonir mahad brahma, indicate\nthat everything in the material world is the manifestation of Brahman; and,\nalthough the effects are differently manifested, they are nondifferent from the\ncause. In the \u012a\u015bopani\u1e63ad it is said that everything is related to the Supreme\nBrahman or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and thus everything belongs to Him only. One who knows\nperfectly well that everything belongs to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, that He is the proprietor of\neverything and that, therefore, everything is engaged in the service of the\nLord, naturally has nothing to do with the results of his activities, whether\nvirtuous or sinful. Even one\u2019s material body, being a gift of the Lord for\ncarrying out a particular type of action, can be engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\nIt is beyond contamination by sinful reactions, exactly as the lotus leaf,\nthough remaining in the water, is not wet.

He himself belongs to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and the body too\nbelongs to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. When he applies everything produced of the body, mind,\nintelligence, words, life, wealth, etc.\u2014whatever he may have within his\npossession\u2014to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s service, he is at once dovetailed with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He is one\nwith K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and is devoid of the false ego that leads one to believe that he is\nthe body, etc. This is the perfect stage of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.",

K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme\nAbsolute Truth, the Personality of Godhead. In K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, there is no\nduality. All that exists is a product of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s energy, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is all good.\nTherefore, activities in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness are on the absolute plane; they are\ntranscendental and have no material effect. One is, therefore, filled with peace\nin K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. One who is, however, entangled in profit calculation for\nsense gratification cannot have that peace.

PURPORT  The embodied soul lives in the city of nine gates. The activities of the body,\nor the figurative city of body, are conducted automatically by the particular\nmodes of nature. The soul, although subjecting himself to the conditions of the\nbody, can be beyond those conditions, if he so desires.

Somehow, the superior nature, the living entity, has been\nin contact with material nature since time immemorial. The temporary body or\nmaterial dwelling place which he obtains is the cause of varieties of activities\nand their resultant reactions. Living in such a conditional atmosphere, one\nsuffers the results of the activities of the body by identifying himself (in\nignorance) with the body. It is ignorance acquired from time immemorial that is\nthe cause of bodily suffering and distress.

TRANSLATION  Nor does the Supreme Spirit assume anyone\u2019s sinful or pious activities. Embodied\nbeings, however, are bewildered because of the ignorance which covers their real\nknowledge.  PURPORT  The Sanskrit word vibhu\u1e25 means the Supreme Lord who is full of unlimited\nknowledge, riches, strength, fame, beauty and renunciation. He is always\nsatisfied in Himself, undisturbed by sinful or pious activities. He does not\ncreate a particular situation for any living entity, but the living entity,\nbewildered by ignorance, desires to be put into certain conditions of life, and\nthereby his chain of action and reaction begins. A living entity is, by superior\nnature, full of knowledge. Nevertheless, he is prone to be influenced by\nignorance due to his limited power. The Lord is omnipotent, but the living\nentity is not. The Lord is vibhu, or omniscient, but the living entity is a\u1e47u,\nor atomic. Because he is a living soul, he has the capacity to desire by his\nfree will. Such desire is fulfilled only by the omnipotent Lord. And so, when\nthe living entity is bewildered in his desires, the Lord allows him to fulfill\nthose desires, but the Lord is never responsible for the actions and reactions\nof the particular situation which may be desired. Being in a bewildered\ncondition, therefore, the embodied soul identifies himself with the\ncircumstantial material body and becomes subjected to the temporary misery and\nhappiness of life. The Lord is the constant companion of the living entity as\nParam\u0101tm\u0101, or the Supersoul, and therefore He can understand the desires of the\nindividual soul, as one can smell the flavor of a flower by being near it.\nDesire is a subtle form of conditioning of the living entity. The Lord fulfills\nhis desire as he deserves: Man proposes and God disposes. The individual is not,\ntherefore, omnipotent in fulfilling his desires. The Lord, however, can fulfill\nall desires, and the Lord, being neutral to everyone, does not interfere with\nthe desires of the minute independant living entities. However, when one desires\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Lord takes special care and encourages one to desire in such a way\nthat one can attain to Him and be eternally happy. The Vedic hymn therefore\ndeclares:  e\u1e63a u hy eva s\u0101dhu karma k\u0101rayati ta\u1e41 yamebhyo lokebhya unnin\u012b\u1e63ate e\u1e63a u\nev\u0101s\u0101dhu karma k\u0101rayati yamadho nin\u012b\u1e63ate.  aj\u00f1o jantur an\u012bso \u2019yam \u0101tmana\u1e25 sukha-du\u1e25khayo\u1e25 \u012b\u015bvara-prerito gacchet svarga\u1e41\nv\u0101\u015bvabhram eva ca.  \u201cThe Lord engages the living entity in pious activities so he may be elevated.\nThe Lord engages him in impious activities so he may go to hell. The living\nentity is completely dependant in his distress and happiness. By the will of the\nSupreme he can go to heaven or hell, as a cloud is driven by the air.\u201d  Therefore the embodied soul, by his immemorial desire to avoid K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness, causes his own bewilderment. Consequently, although he is\nconstitutionally eternal, blissful and cognizant, due to the littleness of his\nexistence he forgets his constitutional position of service to the Lord and is\nthus entrapped by nescience. And, under the spell of ignorance, the living\nentity claims that the Lord is responsible for his conditional existence. The\nVed\u0101nta-s\u016btras also confirm this:  vai\u1e63amya-nairgh\u1e5b\u1e47ye na s\u0101pek\u1e63atv\u0101t tath\u0101 hi dar\u015bayati.  \u201cThe Lord neither hates nor likes anyone, though He appears to.\u201d",

It is stated in the\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, \u201csarva\u1e41 j\u00f1\u0101na-plavena,\u201d \u201cj\u00f1\u0101n\u0101gni\u1e25 sarva-karm\u0101\u1e47i\u201d and \u201cna hi\nj\u00f1\u0101nena sad\u1e5b\u015bam.\u201d Knowledge is always highly esteemed. And what is that\nknowledge? Perfect knowledge is achieved when one surrenders unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, as is\nsaid in the Seventh Chapter, 19th verse: bah\u016bn\u0101\u1e41 janman\u0101m ante j\u00f1\u0101nav\u0101n m\u0101\u1e41\nprapadyate. After passing through many, many births, when one perfect in\nknowledge surrenders unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or when one attains K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, then\neverything is revealed to him, as the sun reveals everything in the daytime. The\nliving entity is bewildered in so many ways. For instance, when he thinks\nhimself God, unceremoniously, he actually falls into the last snare of\nnescience. If a living entity is God, then how can he become bewildered by\nnescience? Does God become bewildered by nescience? If so, then nescience, or\nSatan, is greater than God. Real knowledge can be obtained from a person who is\nin perfect K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Therefore, one has to seek out such a bona fide\nspiritual master and, under him, learn what K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is. The\nspiritual master can drive away all nescience, as the sun drives away darkness.\nEven though a person may be in full knowledge that he is not this body but is\ntranscendental to the body, he still may not be able to discriminate between the\nsoul and the Supersoul. However, he can know everything well if he cares to take\nshelter of the perfect, bona fide K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious spiritual master. One can know\nGod and one\u2019s relationship with God only when one actually meets a\nrepresentative of God. A representative of God never claims that he is God,\nalthough he is paid all the respect ordinarily paid to God because he has\nknowledge of God. One has to learn the distinction between God and the living\nentity. Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a therefore stated in the Second Chapter (2.12) that every\nliving being is individual and that the Lord also is individual. They were all\nindividuals in the past, they are individuals at present, and they will continue\nto be individuals in the future, even after liberation. At night we see\neverything as one in the darkness, but in day when the sun is up, we see\neverything in its real identity. Identity with individuality in spiritual life\nis real knowledge.",

The Lord as Param\u0101tm\u0101 is present both in the outcaste and in the\nbr\u0101hma\u1e47a, although the body of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a and that of an outcaste are not the\nsame. The bodies are material productions of different modes of material nature,\nbut the soul and the Supersoul within the body are of the same spiritual\nquality. The similarity in the quality of the soul and the Supersoul, however,\ndoes not make them equal in quantity, for the individual soul is present only in\nthat particular body, whereas the Param\u0101tm\u0101 is present in each and every body. A\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person has full knowledge of this, and therefore he is truly\nlearned and has equal vision. The similar characteristics of the soul and\nSupersoul are that they are both conscious, eternal and blissful. But the\ndifference is that the individual soul is conscious within the limited\njurisdiction of the body, whereas the Supersoul is conscious of all bodies. The\nSupersoul is present in all bodies without distinction.",

Even great sages are not able to control the forces of the senses as\neffectively as those who are engaged in transcendental bliss by serving the\nlotus feet of the Lord, uprooting the deep grown desire for fruitive\nactivities.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 4.22.39)  In the conditioned soul the desire to enjoy the fruitive results of work is so\ndeep-rooted that it is very difficult even for the great sages to control such\ndesires, despite great endeavors. A devotee of the Lord, constantly engaged in\ndevotional service in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, perfect in self-realization, very\nquickly attains liberation in the Supreme. Owing to his complete knowledge in\nself-realization, he always remains in trance. To cite an analagous example of\nthis:  dar\u015bana-dhy\u0101na-sa\u1e41spar\u015bair matsya-k\u016brma-viha\u1e45gam\u0101\u1e25 sv\u0101nya paty\u0101ni pu\u1e63\u1e47anti\ntath\u0101ham api padmaja.  \u201cBy vision, by meditation and by touch only do the fish, the tortoise and the\nbirds maintain their offspring.

The eggs of the tortoise are laid on\nland, and the tortoise meditates on the eggs while in the water. Similarly, a\ndevotee in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, although far away from the Lord\u2019s abode, can\nelevate himself to that abode simply by thinking of Him constantly\u2014by engagement\nin K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. He does not feel the pangs of material miseries; this\nstate of life is called brahma-nirv\u0101\u1e47a, or the absence of material miseries due\nto being constantly immersed in the Supreme.",

TRANSLATION  Shutting out all external sense objects, keeping the eyes and vision\nconcentrated between the two eyebrows, suspending the inward and outward breaths\nwithin the nostrils\u2014thus controlling the mind, senses and intelligence, the\ntranecendentalist becomes free from desire, fear and anger. One who is always in\nthis state is certainly liberated.  PURPORT  Being engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, one can immediately understand one\u2019s\nspiritual identity, and then one can understand the Supreme Lord by means of\ndevotional service. When he is well situated in devotional service, one comes to\nthe transcendental position, qualified to feel the presence of the Lord in the\nsphere of one\u2019s activity. This particular position is called liberation in the\nSupreme.  After explaining the above principles of liberation in the Supreme, the Lord\ngives instruction to Arjuna as to how one can come to that position by the\npractice of mysticism or yoga, known as a\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45ga-yoga, which is divisible into an\neightfold procedure called yama, niyama, \u0101sana, pr\u0101\u1e47\u0101y\u0101ma, praty\u0101h\u0101ra, dh\u0101ra\u1e47\u0101,\ndhy\u0101na, and sam\u0101dhi. In the Sixth Chapter the subject of yoga is explicitly\ndetailed, and at the end of the Fifth it is only preliminarily explained. One\nhas to drive out the sense objects such as sound, touch, form, taste and smell\nby the praty\u0101h\u0101ra (breathing) process in yoga, and then keep the vision of the\neyes between the two eyebrows and concentrate on the tip of the nose with half\nclosed lids. There is no benefit in closing the eyes altogether, because then\nthere is every chance of falling asleep. Nor is there benefit in opening the\neyes completely, because then there is the hazard of being attracted by sense\nobjects. The breathing movement is restrained within the nostrils by\nneutralizing the up- and down-moving air within the body. By practice of such\nyoga one is able to gain control over the senses, refrain from outward sense\nobjects, and thus prepare oneself for liberation in the Supreme.  This yoga process helps one become free from all kinds of fear and anger and\nthus feel the presence of the Supersoul in the transcendental situation. In\nother words, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is the easiest process of executing yoga\nprinciples. This will be thoroughly explained in the next chapter. A K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconscious person, however, being always engaged in devotional service, does not\nrisk losing his senses to some other engagement. This is a better way of\ncontrolling the senses than by the a\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45ga-yoga.",

TRANSLATION  The sages, knowing Me as the ultimate purpose of all sacrifices and austerities,\nthe Supreme Lord of all planets and demigods and the benefactor and well-wisher\nof all living entities, attain peace from the pangs of material miseries.  PURPORT  The conditioned souls within the clutches of illusory energy are all anxious to\nattain peace in the material world. But they do not know the formula for peace,\nwhich is explained in this part of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. The greatest peace formula\nis simply this: Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the beneficiary in all human activities. Men\nshould offer everything to the transcendental service of the Lord because He is\nthe proprietor of all planets and the demigods thereon. No one is greater than\nHe. He is greater than the greatest of the demigods, Lord \u015aiva and Lord Brahm\u0101.\nIn the Vedas the Supreme Lord is described as tam \u012b\u015bvar\u0101\u1e47\u0101\u1e41 parama\u1e41 mahe\u015bvaram.\nUnder the spell of illusion, living entities are trying to be lords of all they\nsurvey, but actually they are dominated by the material energy of the Lord. The\nLord is the master of material nature, and the conditioned souls are under the\nstringent rules of material nature. Unless one understands these bare facts, it\nis not possible to achieve peace in the world either individually or\ncollectively. This is the sense of Kssna consciousness: Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the\nsupreme predominator, and all living entities, including the great demigods, are\nHis subordinates. One can attain perfect peace only in complete K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness.  This Fifth Chapter is a practical explanation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, generally\nknown as karma-yoga. The question of mental speculation as to how karma-yoga can\ngive liberation is answered herewith. To work in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is to work\nwith the complete knowledge of the Lord as the predominator. Such work is not\ndifferent from transcendental knowledge. Direct K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is\nbhakti-yoga, and j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga is a path leading to bhakti-yoga. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness means to work in full knowledge of one\u2019s relationship with the\nSupreme Absolute, and the perfection of this consciousness is full knowledge of\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead. A pure soul is the eternal servant\nof God as His fragmental part and parcel. He comes into contact with m\u0101y\u0101\n(illusion) due to the desire to lord it over m\u0101y\u0101, and that is the cause of his\nmany sufferings. As long as he is in contact with matter, he has to execute work\nin terms of material necessities. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, however, brings one into\nspiritual life even while one is within the jurisdiction of matter, for it is an\narousing of spiritual existence by practice in the material world. The more one\nis advanced, the more he is freed from the clutches of matter. The Lord is not\npartial toward anyone. Everything depends on one\u2019s practical performance of\nduties in an effort to control the senses and conquer the influence of desire\nand anger. And, attaining K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness by controlling the above-mentioned\npassions, one remains factually in the transcendental stage, or brahman-nirv\u0101\u1e47a.\nThe eightfold yoga mysticism is automatically practiced in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness\nbecause the ultimate purpose is served. There is gradual process of elevation in\nthe practice of yama, niyama, \u0101sana, praty\u0101h\u0101ra, dhy\u0101na, dh\u0101ra\u1e47\u0101, pr\u0101\u1e47\u0101y\u0101ma, and\nsam\u0101dhi. But these only preface perfection by devotional service, which alone\ncan award peace to the human being. It is the highest perfection of life.",

However, this is very difficult\nfor people in general to perform, especially in the age of Kali. Although the\neightfold yoga system is recommended in this chapter, the Lord emphasizes that\nthe process of karma-yoga, or acting in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, is better. Everyone\nacts in this world to maintain his family and their paraphernalia, but no one is\nworking without some self-interest, some personal gratification, be it\nconcentrated or extended. The criterion of perfection is to act in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness, and not with a view to enjoying the fruits of work. To act in\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is the duty of every living entity because all are\nconstitutionally parts and parcels of the Supreme. The parts of the body work\nfor the satisfaction of the whole body. The limbs of the body do not act for\nself-satisfaction but for the satisfaction of the complete whole. Similarly, the\nliving entity who acts for satisfaction of the supreme whole and not for\npersonal satisfaction is the perfect sanny\u0101s\u012b, the perfect yog\u012b.\n\n\nThe sanny\u0101s\u012bs sometimes artificially think that they have become liberated from\nall material duties, and therefore they cease to perform agnihotra yaj\u00f1as (fire\nsacrifices), but actually they are self-interested because their goal is\nbecoming one with the impersonal Brahman. Such a desire is greater than any\nmaterial desire, but it is not without self-interest. Similarly, the mystic yog\u012b\nwho practices the yoga system with half-open eyes, ceasing all material\nactivities, desires some satisfaction for his personal self. But a person acting\nin K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness works for the satisfaction of the whole, without\nself-interest. A K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person has no desire for self-satisfaction. His\ncriterion of success is the satisfaction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and thus he is the perfect\nsanny\u0101s\u012b, or perfect yog\u012b. Lord Caitanya, the highest perfectional symbol of\nrenunciation, prays in this way:\n\n\nna dhana\u1e41 na jana\u1e41 na sundar\u012b\u1e41 kavit\u0101\u1e41 v\u0101 jagad\u012b\u015ba k\u0101maye.  mama janmani\njanman\u012b\u015bvare bhavat\u0101d bhaktir ahaituk\u012b tvayi.\n\n\n\u201cO Almighty Lord, I have no desire to accumulate wealth, nor to enjoy beautiful\nwomen.

The living entity has no\nseparate independant identity. He is the marginal energy of the Supreme. When he\nis entrapped by material energy, he is conditioned, and when he is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconscious, or aware of the spiritual energy, then he is in his real and natural\nstate of life. Therefore, when one is in complete knowledge, one ceases all\nmaterial sense gratification, or renounces all kinds of sense gratificatory\nactivities. This is practiced by the yog\u012bs who restrain the senses from material\nattachment. But a person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness has no opportunity to engage his\nsenses in anything which is not for the purpose of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore, a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconscious person is simultaneously a sanny\u0101s\u012b and a yog\u012b. The purpose of\nknowledge and of restraining the senses, as prescribed in the j\u00f1\u0101na and yoga\nprocesses, is automatically served in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. If one is unable to\ngive up the activities of his selfish nature, then j\u00f1\u0101na and yoga are of no\navail. The real aim is for a living entity to give up all selfish satisfaction\nand to be prepared to satisfy the Supreme. A K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person has no\ndesire for any kind of self-enjoyment. He is always engaged for the enjoyment of\nthe Supreme. One who has no information of the Supreme must therefore be engaged\nin self-satisfaction because no one can stand on the platform of inactivity. All\nthese purposes are perfectly served by the practice of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\n\n\n6.3\n\n\n\u0101ruruk\u1e63or muner yoga\u1e41\n\n\nkarma k\u0101ra\u1e47am ucyate\n\n\nyog\u0101r\u016b\u1e0dhasya tasyaiva\n\n\n\u015bama\u1e25 k\u0101ra\u1e47am ucyate\n\n\n\u0101ruruk\u1e63o\u1e25\u2014of one who has just begun yoga; mune\u1e25\u2014of the sage; yogam\u2014the eightfold\nyoga system; karma\u2014work; k\u0101ra\u1e47am\u2014the cause; ucyate\u2014is said to be; yoga\u2014eightfold\nyoga; \u0101r\u016b\u1e0dhasya\u2014one who has attained; tasya\u2014his; eva\u2014certainly; \u015bama\u1e25\u2014cessation\nof all material activities; k\u0101ra\u1e47am\u2014the cause; ucyate\u2014is said to be.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nFor one who is a neophyte in the eightfold yoga system, work is said to be the\nmeans; and for one who has already attained to yoga, cessation of all material\nactivities is said to be the means.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe process of linking oneself with the Supreme is called yoga, which may be\ncompared to a ladder for attaining the topmost spiritual realization. This\nladder begins from the lowest material condition of the living entity and rises\nup to perfect self-realization in pure spiritual life. According to various\nelevations, different parts of the ladder are known by different names. But all\nin all, the complete ladder is called yoga and may be divided into three parts,\nnamely j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga, dhy\u0101na-yoga and bhakti-yoga. The beginning of the ladder is\ncalled the yog\u0101ruruk\u1e63a stage, and the highest rung is called yog\u0101r\u016b\u1e0dha.\n\n\nConcerning the eightfold yoga system, attempts in the beginning to enter into\nmeditation through regulative principles of life and practice of different\nsitting postures (which are more or less bodily exercises) are considered\nfruitive material activities. All such activities lead to achieving perfect\nmental equilibrium to control the senses. When one is accomplished in the\npractice of meditation, he ceases all disturbing mental activities.\n\n\nA K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person is, however, situated from the beginning on the\nplatform of meditation because he always thinks of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. And, being constantly\nengaged in the service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he is considered to have ceased all material\nactivities.\n\n\n6.4\n\n\nyad\u0101 hi nendriy\u0101rthe\u1e63u\n\n\nna karmasv anu\u1e63ajjate\n\n\nsarva-sa\u1e45kalpa-sanny\u0101s\u012b\n\n\nyog\u0101r\u016b\u1e0dhas tadocyate\n\n\nyad\u0101\u2014when; hi\u2014certainly; na\u2014not; indriya-arthe\u1e63u\u2014in sense gratification;\nna\u2014never; karmasu\u2014in fruitive activities; anu\u1e63ajjate\u2014does necessarily engage;\nsarva-sa\u1e45kalpa\u2014all material desires; sanny\u0101s\u012b\u2014renouncer; yoga-\u0101r\u016b\u1e0dha\u1e25\u2014elevated\nin yoga; tad\u0101\u2014at that time; ucyate\u2014is said to be.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nA person is said to have attained to yoga when, having renounced all material\ndesires, he neither acts for sense gratification nor engages in fruitive\nactivities.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nWhen a person is fully engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord,\nhe is pleased in himself, and thus he is no longer engaged in sense\ngratification or in fruitive activities. Otherwise, one must be engaged in sense\ngratification, since one cannot live without engagement. Without K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness, one must be always seeking self-centered or extended selfish\nactivities. But a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person can do everything for the satisfaction\nof K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and thereby be perfectly detached from sense gratification. One who has\nno such realization must mechanically try to escape material desires before\nbeing elevated to the top rung of the yoga ladder.\n\n\n6.5\n\n\nuddhared \u0101tman\u0101tm\u0101na\u1e41\n\n\nn\u0101tm\u0101nam avas\u0101dayet\n\n\n\u0101tmaiva hy \u0101tmano bandhur\n\n\n\u0101tmaiva ripur \u0101tmana\u1e25\n\n\nuddharet\u2014one must deliver; \u0101tman\u0101\u2014by the mind; \u0101tm\u0101nam\u2014the conditioned soul;\nna\u2014never; \u0101tm\u0101nam\u2014the conditioned soul; avas\u0101dayet\u2014put into degradation;\n\u0101tm\u0101\u2014mind; eva\u2014certainly; hi\u2014indeed; \u0101tmana\u1e25\u2014of the conditioned soul;\nbandhu\u1e25\u2014friend; \u0101tm\u0101\u2014mind; eva\u2014certainly; ripu\u1e25\u2014enemy; \u0101tmana\u1e25\u2014of the\nconditioned soul.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nA man must elevate himself by his own mind, not degrade himself. The mind is the\nfriend of the conditioned soul, and his enemy as well.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe word \u0101tm\u0101 denotes body, mind and soul\u2014depending upon different\ncircumstances. In the yoga system, the mind and the conditioned soul are\nespecially important. Since the mind is the central point of yoga practice, \u0101tm\u0101\nrefers here to the mind. The purpose of the yoga system is to control the mind\nand to draw it away from attachment to sense objects. It is stressed herein that\nthe mind must be so trained that it can deliver the conditioned soul from the\nmire of nescience. In material existence one is subjected to the influence of\nthe mind and the senses. In fact, the pure soul is entangled in the material\nworld because of the mind\u2019s ego which desires to lord it over material nature.\nTherefore, the mind should be trained so that it will not be attracted by the\nglitter of material nature, and in this way the conditioned soul may be saved.\nOne should not degrade oneself by attraction to sense objects. The more one is\nattracted by sense objects, the more one becomes entangled in material\nexistence. The best way to disentangle oneself is to always engage the mind in\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. The word hi is used for emphasizing this point, i.e., that\none must do this. It is also said:\n\n\nmana eva manu\u1e63y\u0101\u1e47\u0101\u1e41 k\u0101ra\u1e47a\u1e41 bandha-mok\u1e63ayo\u1e25 bandh\u0101ya vi\u1e63ay\u0101sa\u1e45go muktyai\nnirvi\u1e63aya\u1e41 mana\u1e25.\n\n\n\u201cFor man, mind is the cause of bondage and mind is the cause of liberation.

Unless the mind is controlled, the\npractice of yoga (for show) is simply a waste of time. One who cannot control\nhis mind lives always with the greatest enemy, and thus his life and its mission\nare spoiled. The constitutional position of the living entity is to carry out\nthe order of the superior. As long as one\u2019s mind remains an unconquered enemy,\none has to serve the dictations of lust, anger, avarice, illusion, etc. But when\nthe mind is conquered, one voluntarily agrees to abide by the dictation of the\nPersonality of Godhead, who is situated within the heart of everyone as\nParam\u0101tm\u0101. Real yoga practice entails meeting the Param\u0101tm\u0101 within the heart and\nthen following His dictation. For one who takes to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness directly,\nperfect surrender to the dictation of the Lord follows automatically.\n\n\n6.7\n\n\njit\u0101tmana\u1e25 pra\u015b\u0101ntasya\n\n\nparam\u0101tm\u0101 sam\u0101hita\u1e25\n\n\n\u015b\u012bto\u1e63\u1e47a-sukha-du\u1e25khe\u1e63u\n\n\ntath\u0101 m\u0101n\u0101pam\u0101nayo\u1e25\n\n\njita-\u0101tmana\u1e25\u2014of one who has conquered his mind; pra\u015b\u0101ntasya\u2014of one who has\nattained tranquility by such control over the mind; param\u0101tm\u0101\u2014the Supersoul;\nsam\u0101hita\u1e25\u2014approached completely; \u015b\u012bta\u2014cold; u\u1e63\u1e47a\u2014heat; sukha\u2014in happiness;\ndu\u1e25khe\u1e63u\u2014in distress; tath\u0101\u2014also; m\u0101na\u2014honor; apam\u0101nayo\u1e25\u2014in dishonor.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nFor one who has conquered the mind, the Supersoul is already reached, for he has\nattained tranquility. To such a man happiness and distress, heat and cold, honor\nand dishonor are all the same.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nActually, every living entity is intended to abide by the dictation of the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead, who is seated in everyone\u2019s heart as Param\u0101tm\u0101.\nWhen the mind is misled by the external illusory energy, one becomes entangled\nin material activities. Therefore, as soon as one\u2019s mind is controlled through\none of the yoga systems, one is to be considered as having already reached the\ndestination. One has to abide by superior dictation. When one\u2019s mind is fixed on\nthe superior nature, he has no other alternative but to follow the dictation of\nthe Supreme. The mind must admit some superior dictation and follow it. The\neffect of controlling the mind is that one automatically follows the dictation\nof the Param\u0101tm\u0101 or Supersoul. Because this transcendental position is at once\nachieved by one who is in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, the devotee of the Lord is\nunaffected by the dualities of material existence, namely distress and\nhappiness, cold and heat, etc. This state is practical sam\u0101dhi, or absorption in\nthe Supreme.\n\n\n6.8\n\n\nj\u00f1\u0101na-vij\u00f1\u0101na-t\u1e5bpt\u0101tm\u0101\n\n\nk\u016b\u1e6da-stho vijitendriya\u1e25\n\n\nyukta ity ucyate yog\u012b\n\n\nsama-lo\u1e63\u1e6dr\u0101\u015bma-k\u0101\u00f1cana\u1e25\n\n\nj\u00f1\u0101na\u2014acquired knowledge; vij\u00f1\u0101na\u2014realized knowledge; t\u1e5bpta\u2014satisfied;\n\u0101tm\u0101\u2014living entity; k\u016b\u1e6dastha\u1e25\u2014spiritually situated; vijita-indriya\u1e25\u2014sensually\ncontrolled; yukta\u1e25\u2014competent for self-realization; iti\u2014thus; ucyate\u2014is said;\nyog\u012b\u2014the mystic; sama\u2014equiposed; lo\u1e63\u1e6dra\u2014pebbles; a\u015bma\u2014stone; k\u0101\u00f1cana\u1e25\u2014gold.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nA person is said to be established in self-realization and is called a yog\u012b [or\nmystic] when he is fully satisfied by virtue of acquired knowledge and\nrealization.

He should be free from desires and feelings of possessiveness.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is realized in different degrees as Brahman, Param\u0101tm\u0101 and the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness means, concisely, to be always\nengaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. But those who are\nattached to the impersonal Brahman or the localized Supersoul are also partially\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, because impersonal Brahman is the spiritual ray of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and\nSupersoul is the all-pervading partial expansion of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Thus the\nimpersonalist and the meditator are also indirectly K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious. A directly\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person is the topmost transcendentalist because such a devotee\nknows what is meant by Brahman or Param\u0101tm\u0101. His knowledge of the Absolute Truth\nis perfect, whereas the impersonalist and the meditative yog\u012b are imperfectly\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious.\n\n\nNevertheless, all of these are instructed herewith to be constantly engaged in\ntheir particular pursuits so that they may come to the highest perfection sooner\nor later. The first business of a transcendentalist is to keep the mind always\non K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. One should always think of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and not forget Him even for a moment.\nConcentration of the mind on the Supreme is called sam\u0101dhi or trance. In order\nto concentrate the mind, one should always remain in seclusion and avoid\ndisturbance by external objects. He should be very careful to accept favorable\nand reject unfavorable conditions that affect his realization. And, in perfect\ndetermination, he should not hanker after unnecessary material things that\nentangle him by feelings of possessiveness.\n\n\nAll these perfections and precautions are perfectly executed when one is\ndirectly in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness because direct K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness means\nself-abnegation, wherein there is very little chance for material\npossessiveness. \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b characterizes K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness in this\nway:\n\n\nan\u0101saktasya vi\u1e63ay\u0101n yath\u0101rham upayu\u00f1jata\u1e25 nirbandha\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-sambandhe yukta\u1e41\nvair\u0101gyam ucyate pr\u0101pa\u00f1cikatay\u0101 buddhy\u0101 hari-sambandhi-vastuna\u1e25 mumuk\u1e63ubhi\u1e25\nparity\u0101go vair\u0101gya\u1e41 phalgu kathyate.\n\n\n(Bhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu 2.255\u2013256)\n\n\n\u201cWhen one is not attached to anything, but at the same time accepts everything\nin relation to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one is rightly situated above possessiveness.

As such, he has no\nhankering for anything on his own personal account. He knows how to accept\nthings in favor of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and how to reject things unfavorable to\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. He is always aloof from material things because he is\nalways transcendental, and he is always alone, having nothing to do with persons\nnot in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.

The yoga process is\npracticed in order to discover and see this localized form of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, and not for\nany other purpose. The localized Vi\u1e63\u1e47u-m\u016brti is the plenary representation of\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a dwelling within one\u2019s heart. One who has no program to realize this\nVi\u1e63\u1e47u-murti is uselessly engaged in mock-yoga practice and is certainly wasting\nhis time. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47\u0101 is the ultimate goal of life, and the Vi\u1e63\u1e47u-murti situated in\none\u2019s heart is the object of yoga practice. To realize this Vi\u1e63\u1e47u-murti within\nthe heart, one has to observe complete abstinence from sex life; therefore one\nhas to leave home and live alone in a secluded place, remaining seated as\nmentioned above. One cannot enjoy sex life daily at home or elsewhere and attend\na so-called yoga class and thus become a yog\u012b. One has to practice controlling\nthe mind and avoiding all kinds of sense gratification, of which sex life is the\nchief. In the rules of celibacy written by the great sage Y\u0101j\u00f1avalkya it is\nsaid:\n\n\nkarma\u1e47\u0101 manas\u0101 v\u0101c\u0101 sarv\u0101vasth\u0101su sarvad\u0101 sarvatra maithu\u1e47a-ty\u0101go brahmacarya\u1e41\npracak\u1e63ate.\n\n\n\u201cThe vow of brahmacarya is meant to help one completely abstain from sex\nindulgence in work, words and mind\u2014at all times, under all circumstances, and in\nall places.\u201d No one can perform correct yoga practice through sex indulgence.\nBrahmacarya is taught, therefore, from childhood when one has no knowledge of\nsex life. Children at the age of five are sent to the guru-kula, or the place of\nthe spiritual master, and the master trains the young boys in the strict\ndiscipline of becoming brahmac\u0101r\u012bs. Without such practice, no one can make\nadvancement in any yoga, whether it be dhy\u0101na, j\u00f1\u0101na or bhakti. One who,\nhowever, follows the rules and regulations of married life, having sexual\nrelationship only with his wife (and that also under regulation), is also called\nbrahmac\u0101r\u012b. Such a restrained householder brahmac\u0101r\u012b may be accepted in the\nbhakti school, but the j\u00f1\u0101na and dhy\u0101na schools do not admit even householder\nbrahmac\u0101r\u012bs. They require complete abstinence without compromise. In the bhakti\nschool, a householder brahmac\u0101r\u012b is allowed controlled sex life because the cult\nof bhakti-yoga is so powerful that one automatically loses sexual attraction,\nbeing engaged in the superior service of the Lord. In the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 it is\nsaid:\n\n\nvi\u1e63ay\u0101 vinivartante nir\u0101h\u0101rasya dehina\u1e25 rasa-varja\u1e41 raso \u2019py asya para\u1e41 d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dv\u0101\nnivartate\n\n\nWhereas others are forced to restrain themselves from sense gratification, a\ndevotee of the Lord automatically refrains because of superior taste. Other than\nthe devotee, no one has any information of that superior taste.\n\n\nVigatabh\u012b\u1e25. One cannot be fearless unless one is fully in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. A\nconditioned soul is fearful due to his perverted memory, his forgetfulness of\nhis eternal relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The Bh\u0101gavatam says, bhaya\u1e41\ndvit\u012by\u0101bhinive\u015bata\u1e25 sy\u0101d \u012b\u015b\u0101d apetasya viparyayo \u2018sm\u1e5bti\u1e25: K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is\nthe only basis for fearlessness. Therefore, perfect practice is possible for a\nperson who is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious. And since the ultimate goal of yoga practice is\nto see the Lord within, a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person is already the best of all\nyog\u012bs. The principles of the yoga system mentioned herein are different from\nthose of the popular so-called yoga societies.\n\n\n6.15\n\n\nyu\u00f1jann eva\u1e41 sad\u0101tm\u0101na\u1e41\n\n\nyog\u012b niyata-m\u0101nasa\u1e25\n\n\n\u015b\u0101nti\u1e41 nirv\u0101\u1e47a-param\u0101\u1e41\n\n\nmat-sa\u1e41sth\u0101m adhigacchati\n\n\nyu\u00f1jan\u2014practicing like this; evam\u2014as mentioned above; sad\u0101\u2014constantly;\n\u0101tm\u0101nam\u2014body, mind and soul; yog\u012b\u2014the mystic transcendentalist;\nniyata-m\u0101nasa\u1e25\u2014regulated mind; \u015b\u0101ntim\u2014peace; nirv\u0101\u1e47a-param\u0101m\u2014cessation of\nmaterial existence; mat-sa\u1e41sth\u0101m\u2014in the spiritual sky (the kingdom of God);\nadhigacchati\u2014does attain.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThus practicing control of the body, mind and activities, the mystic\ntranscendentalist attains to the kingdom of God [or the abode of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a] by\ncessation of material existence.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe ultimate goal in practicing yoga is now clearly explained. Yoga practice is\nnot meant for attaining any kind of material facility; it is to enable the\ncessation of all material existence. One who seeks an improvement in health or\naspires after material perfection is no yog\u012b according to Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Nor\ndoes cessation of material existence entail one\u2019s entering into \u201cthe void,\u201d\nwhich is only a myth. There is no void anywhere within the creation of the Lord.\nRather, the cessation of material existence enables one to enter into the\nspiritual sky, the abode of the Lord. The abode of the Lord is also clearly\ndescribed in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 as that place where there is no need of sun,\nmoon, nor electricity. All the planets in the spiritual kingdom are\nself-illuminated like the sun in the material sky. The kingdom of God is\neverywhere, but the spiritual sky and the planets thereof are called para\u1e41\ndh\u0101ma, or superior abodes.\n\n\nA consummate yog\u012b, who is perfect in understanding Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, as is clearly\nstated herein (mat-citta\u1e25, mat-para\u1e25, mat-sth\u0101nam) by the Lord Himself, can\nattain real peace and can ultimately reach His supreme abode, the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-loka\nknown as Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. In the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 it is clearly stated (goloka\neva nivasaty akhil\u0101tma-bh\u016bta\u1e25) that the Lord, although residing always in His\nabode called Goloka, is the all-pervading Brahman and the localized Param\u0101tm\u0101 as\nwell by dint of His superior spiritual energies. No one can reach the spiritual\nsky or enter into the eternal abode (Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana) of the Lord\nwithout the proper understanding of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and His plenary expansion Vi\u1e63\u1e47u.\nTherefore a person working in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is the perfect yog\u012b, because\nhis mind is always absorbed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s activities.

Too much\neating means eating more than is required to keep the body and soul together.\nThere is no need for men to eat animals because there is an ample supply of\ngrains, vegetables, fruits and milk. Such simple foodstuff is considered to be\nin the mode of goodness according to the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Animal food is for those\nin the mode of ignorance. Therefore, those who indulge in animal food, drinking,\nsmoking and eating food which is not first offered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a will suffer sinful\nreactions because of eating only polluted things. Bhu\u00f1jate te tv agha\u1e41 papa ye\npacanty \u0101tma-k\u0101ra\u1e47\u0101t. Anyone who eats for sense pleasure, or cooks for himself,\nnot offering his food to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, eats only sin. One who eats sin and eats more\nthan is allotted to him cannot execute perfect yoga. It is best that one eat\nonly the remnants of foodstuff offered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. A person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness\ndoes not eat anything which is not first offered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore, only the\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person can attain perfection in yoga practice. Nor can one who\nartificially abstains from eating, manufacturing his own personal process of\nfasting, practice yoga. The K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person observes fasting as it is\nrecommended in the scriptures. He does not fast or eat more than is required,\nand he is thus competent to perform yoga practice. One who eats more than\nrequired will dream very much while sleeping, and he must consequently sleep\nmore than is required. One should not sleep more than six hours daily. One who\nsleeps more than six hours out of twenty-four is certainly influenced by the\nmode of ignorance. A person in the mode of ignorance is lazy and prone to sleep\na great deal. Such a person cannot perform yoga.\n\n\n6.17\n\n\nyukt\u0101h\u0101ra-vih\u0101rasya\n\n\nyukta-ce\u1e63\u1e6dasya karmasu\n\n\nyukta-svapn\u0101vabodhasya\n\n\nyogo bhavati du\u1e25kha-h\u0101\n\n\nyukta\u2014regulated; \u0101h\u0101ra\u2014eating; vih\u0101rasya\u2014recreation; yukta\u2014regulated;\nce\u1e63\u1e6dasya\u2014of one who works for maintenance; karmasu\u2014in discharging duties;\nyukta\u2014regulated; svapna-avabodhasya\u2014regulated sleep and wakefulness;\nyoga\u1e25\u2014practice of yoga; bhavati\u2014becomes; du\u1e25kha-h\u0101\u2014diminishing pains.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nHe who is temperate in his habits of eating, sleeping, working and recreation\ncan mitigate all material pains by practicing the yoga system.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nExtravagance in the matter of eating, sleeping, defending and mating\u2014which are\ndemands of the body\u2014can block advancement in the practice of yoga. As far as\neating is concerned, it can be regulated only when one is practiced to take and\naccept pras\u0101dam, sanctified food. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is offered, according to the\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (### . 9.26), vegetables, flowers, fruits, grains, milk, etc. In\nthis way, a person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness becomes automatically trained not to\naccept food not meant for human consumption, or which is not in the category of\ngoodness. As far as sleeping is concerned, a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person is always\nalert in the discharge of his duties in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, and therefore any\nunnecessary time spent sleeping is considered a great loss. A K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious\nperson cannot bear to pass a minute of his life without being engaged in the\nservice of the Lord. Therefore, his sleeping is kept to a minimum. His ideal in\nthis respect is \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b, who was always engaged in the service of\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and who could not sleep more than two hours a day, and sometimes not even\nthat. \u1e6ch\u0101kura Harid\u0101sa would not even accept pras\u0101dam nor even sleep for a\nmoment without finishing his daily routine of chanting with his beads three\nhundred thousand names. As far as work is concerned, a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person\ndoes not do anything which is not connected with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s interest, and thus his\nwork is always regulated and is untainted by sense gratification. Since there is\nno question of sense gratification, there is no material leisure for a person in\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. And because he is regulated in all his work, speech, sleep,\nwakefulness and all other bodily activities, there is no material misery for\nhim.\n\n\n6.18\n\n\nyad\u0101 viniyata\u1e41 cittam\n\n\n\u0101tmany ev\u0101vati\u1e63\u1e6dhate\n\n\nnisp\u1e5bha\u1e25 sarva-k\u0101mebhyo\n\n\nyukta ity ucyate tad\u0101\n\n\nyad\u0101\u2014when; viniyatam\u2014particularly disciplined; cittam\u2014the mind and its\nactivities; \u0101tmani\u2014in the Transcendence; eva\u2014certainly; avati\u1e63\u1e6dhate\u2014becomes\nsituated; nisp\u1e5bha\u1e25\u2014devoid of; sarva\u2014all kinds of; k\u0101mebhya\u1e25\u2014material desires;\nyukta\u1e25\u2014well situated in yoga; iti\u2014thus; ucyate\u2014is said to be; tad\u0101\u2014at that time.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nWhen the yog\u012b, by practice of yoga, disciplines his mental activities and\nbecomes situated in Transcendence\u2014devoid of all material desires\u2014he is said to\nhave attained yoga.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe activities of the yog\u012b are distinguished from those of an ordinary person by\nhis characteristic cessation from all kinds of material desires\u2014of which sex is\nthe chief.

Unless the mind is fixed on the lotus feet of the Lord by\nconstant remembrance, such transcendental engagements are not practical. In the\ndevotional service of the Lord, therefore, these prescribed activities are\ncalled arcan\u0101, or engaging all the senses in the service of the Lord.

This\nis characterized by one\u2019s ability to see the self by the pure mind and to relish\nand rejoice in the self. In that joyous state, one is situated in boundless\ntranscendental happiness and enjoys himself through transcendental senses.\nEstablished thus, one never departs from the truth, and upon gaining this he\nthinks there is no greater gain. Being situated in such a position, one is never\nshaken, even in the midst of greatest difficulty. This indeed is actual freedom\nfrom all miseries arising from material contact.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nBy practice of yoga one becomes gradually detached from material concepts. This\nis the primary characteristic of the yoga principle. And after this, one becomes\nsituated in trance, or sam\u0101dhi which means that the yog\u012b realizes the Supersoul\nthrough transcendental mind and intelligence, without any of the misgivings of\nidentifying the self with the Superself. Yoga practice is more or less based on\nthe principles of the Pata\u00f1jali system. Some unauthorized commentators try to\nidentify the individual soul with the Supersoul, and the monists think this to\nbe liberation, but they do not understand the real purpose of the Pata\u00f1jali\nsystem of yoga. There is an acceptance of transcendental pleasure in the\nPata\u00f1jali system, but the monists do not accept this transcendental pleasure out\nof fear of jeopardizing the theory of oneness. The duality of knowledge and\nknower is not accepted by the nondualist, but in this verse transcendental\npleasure\u2014realized through transcendental senses\u2014is accepted. And this is\ncorroborated by the Pata\u00f1jali Muni, the famous exponent of the yoga system. The\ngreat sage declares in his Yoga-s\u016btras: puru\u1e63\u0101rtha-\u015b\u016bny\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 gu\u1e47\u0101n\u0101\u1e41\npratiprasava\u1e25 kaivalya\u1e41 svar\u016bpa-prati\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101 v\u0101 citi-\u015baktir iti.\n\n\nThis citi-\u015bakti, or internal potency, is transcendental. Puru\u1e63\u0101rtha means\nmaterial religiosity, economic development, sense gratification and, at the end,\nthe attempt to become one with the Supreme. This \u201coneness with the Supreme\u201d is\ncalled kaivalyam by the monist. But according to Pata\u00f1jali, this kaivalyam is an\ninternal, or transcendental, potency by which the living entity becomes aware of\nhis constitutional position. In the words of Lord Caitanya, this state of\naffairs is called ceto-darpa\u1e47a-m\u0101rjanam, or clearance of the impure mirror of\nthe mind. This \u201cclearance\u201d is actually liberation, or\nbhava-mah\u0101d\u0101v\u0101gni-nirv\u0101pa\u1e47am. The theory of nirv\u0101\u1e47a\u2014also preliminary\u2014corresponds\nwith this principle. In the Bh\u0101gavatam this is called svar\u016bpe\u1e47a vyavasthiti\u1e25.\nThe Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 also confirms this situation in this verse.\n\n\nAfter nirv\u0101\u1e47a, or material cessation, there is the manifestation of spiritual\nactivities, or devotional service of the Lord, known as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. In\nthe words of the Bh\u0101gavatam, svar\u016bpe\u1e47a vyavasthiti\u1e25: this is the \u201creal life of\nthe living entity.\u201d M\u0101y\u0101, or illusion, is the condition of spiritual life\ncontaminated by material infection. Liberation from this material infection does\nnot mean destruction of the original eternal position of the living entity.\nPata\u00f1jali also accepts this by his words kaivalyam svar\u016bpa-prati\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101 v\u0101\nciti-\u015baktir iti. This citi-\u015bakti or transcendental pleasure, is real life. This\nis confirmed in the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btras as \u0101nandamayo \u2019bhy\u0101s\u0101t. This natural\ntranscendental pleasure is the ultimate goal of yoga and is easily achieved by\nexecution of devotional service, or bhakti-yoga. Bhaktiyoga will be vividly\ndescribed in the Seventh Chapter of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.\n\n\nIn the yoga system, as described in this chapter, there are two kinds of\nsam\u0101dhi, called sampraj\u00f1\u0101ta-sam\u0101dhi and asampraj\u00f1\u0101ta-sam\u0101dhi. When one becomes\nsituated in the transcendental position by various philosophical researches, it\nis called sampraj\u00f1\u0101ta-sam\u0101dhi. In the asampraj\u00f1\u0101ta-sam\u0101dhi there is no longer\nany connection with mundane pleasure, for one is then transcendental to all\nsorts of happiness derived from the senses. When the yog\u012b is once situated in\nthat transcendental position, he is never shaken from it. Unless the yog\u012b is\nable to reach this position, he is unsuccessful. Today\u2019s so-called yoga\npractice, which involves various sense pleasures, is contradictory. A yog\u012b\nindulging in sex and intoxication is a mockery. Even those yog\u012bs who are\nattracted by the siddhis (perfections) in the process of yoga are not perfectly\nsituated. If the yog\u012bs are attracted by the by-products of yoga, then they\ncannot attain the stage of perfection, as is stated in this verse. Persons,\ntherefore, indulging in the make-show practice of gymnastic feats or siddhis\nshould know that the aim of yoga is lost in that way.\n\n\nThe best practice of yoga in this age is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, which is not\nbaffling. A K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person is so happy in his occupation that he does\nnot aspire after any other happiness. There are many impediments, especially in\nthis age of hypocrisy, to practicing ha\u1e6dha-yoga, dhy\u0101na-yoga, and j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga,\nbut there is no such problem in executing karma-yoga or bhakti-yoga.\n\n\nAs long as the material body exists, one has to meet the demands of the body,\nnamely eating, sleeping, defending and mating. But a person who is in pure\nbhakti-yoga or in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness does not arouse the senses while meeting\nthe demands of the body. Rather, he accepts the bare necessities of life, making\nthe best use of a bad bargain, and enjoys transcendental happiness in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness. He is callous toward incidental occurrences\u2014such as accidents,\ndisease, scarcity and even the death of a most dear relative\u2014but he is always\nalert to execute his duties in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness or bhakti-yoga. Accidents\nnever deviate him from his duty. As stated in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, \u0101gam\u0101p\u0101yino\n\u2019nity\u0101s t\u0101\u1e41s titik\u1e63asva bh\u0101rata. He endures all such incidental occurences\nbecause he knows that they come and go and do not affect his duties. In this way\nhe achieves the highest perfection in yoga practice.\n\n\n6.24\n\n\nsa ni\u015bcayena yoktavyo\n\n\nyogo \u2019nirvi\u1e47\u1e47a-cetas\u0101\n\n\nsa\u1e45kalpa-prabhav\u0101n k\u0101m\u0101\u1e41s\n\n\ntyaktv\u0101 sarv\u0101n a\u015be\u1e63ata\u1e25\n\n\nmanasaivendriya-gr\u0101ma\u1e41\n\n\nviniyamya samantata\u1e25\n\n\nsa\u1e25\u2014that yoga system; ni\u015bcayena\u2014with firm determination; yoktavya\u1e25\u2014must be\npracticed; yoga\u1e25\u2014in such practice; anirvi\u1e47\u1e47a-cetas\u0101\u2014without deviation;\nsa\u1e45kalpa\u2014material desires; prabhav\u0101n\u2014born of; k\u0101m\u0101n\u2014sense gratification;\ntyaktv\u0101\u2014giving up; sarv\u0101n\u2014all; a\u015be\u1e63atah\u2014completely; manas\u0101\u2014by the mind;\neva\u2014certainly; indriya-gr\u0101mam\u2014the full set of senses; viniyamya\u2014regulating;\nsamantata\u1e25\u2014from all sides.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nOne should engage oneself in the practice of yoga with undeviating determination\nand faith. One should abandon, without exception, all material desires born of\nfalse ego and thus control all the senses on all sides by the mind.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe yoga practitioner should be determined and should patiently prosecute the\npractice without deviation. One should be sure of success at the end and pursue\nthis course with great perserverance, not becoming discouraged if there is any\ndelay in the attainment of success. Success is sure for the rigid practitioner.\nRegarding bhakti-yoga, Rupa Gosv\u0101m\u012b says:\n\n\nuts\u0101h\u0101n ni\u015bcay\u0101d dhairy\u0101t tat tat karma-pravartan\u0101t sa\u1e45ga-ty\u0101g\u0101t satov\u1e5btte\u1e25\n\u1e63a\u1e0dbhir bhakti\u1e25 prasidhyati\n\n\n\u201cThe process of bhakti-yoga can be executed successfully with full-hearted\nenthusiasm, perseverance, and determination by following the prescribed duties\nin the association of devotees and by engaging completely in activities of\ngoodness.\u201d\n\n\nAs for determination, one should follow the example of the sparrow who lost her\neggs in the waves of the ocean. A sparrow laid her eggs on the shore of the\nocean, but the big ocean carried away the eggs on its waves. The sparrow became\nvery upset and asked the ocean to return her eggs. The ocean did not even\nconsider her appeal. So the sparrow decided to dry up the ocean. She began to\npick out the water in her small beak, and everyone laughed at her for her\nimpossible determination. The news of her activity spread, and at last Garu\u1e0da,\nthe gigantic bird carrier of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, heard it. He became compassionate\ntoward his small sister bird, and so he came to see the sparrow. Garu\u1e0da was very\npleased by the determination of the small sparrow, and he promised to help. Thus\nGaru\u1e0da at once asked the ocean to return her eggs lest he himself take up the\nwork of the sparrow. The ocean was frightened at this, and returned the eggs.\nThus the sparrow became happy by the grace of Garu\u1e0da.\n\n\nSimilarly, the practice of yoga, especially bhakti-yoga in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness,\nmay appear to be a very difficult job. But if anyone follows the principles with\ngreat determination, the Lord will surely help, for God helps those who help\nthemselves.\n\n\n6.25\n\n\n\u015banai\u1e25 \u015banair uparamed\n\n\nbuddhy\u0101 dh\u1e5bti-g\u1e5bh\u012btay\u0101\n\n\n\u0101tma-sa\u1e41stha\u1e41 mana\u1e25 k\u1e5btv\u0101\n\n\nna ki\u00f1cid api cintayet\n\n\n\u015banai\u1e25\u2014gradually; \u015banai\u1e25\u2014step by step; uparamet\u2014hesitated; buddhy\u0101\u2014by\nintelligence; dh\u1e5bti-g\u1e5bh\u012btay\u0101\u2014carrying the conviction; \u0101tma-sa\u1e41stham\u2014placed in\ntranscendence; mana\u1e25\u2014mind; k\u1e5btv\u0101\u2014doing so; na\u2014nothing; ki\u00f1cit\u2014anything else;\napi\u2014even; cintayet\u2014be thinking of.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nGradually, step by step, with full conviction, one should become situated in\ntrance by means of intelligence, and thus the mind should be fixed on the Self\nalone and should think of nothing else.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nBy proper conviction and intelligence one should gradually cease sense\nactivities. This is called praty\u0101h\u0101ra. The mind, being controlled by conviction,\nmeditation, and cessation of the senses, should be situated in trance, or\nsam\u0101dhi. At that time there is no longer any danger of becoming engaged in the\nmaterial conception of life. In other words, although one is involved with\nmatter as long as the material body exists, one should not think about sense\ngratification. One should think of no pleasure aside from the pleasure of the\nSupreme Self. This state is easily attained by directly practicing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness.\n\n\n6.26\n\n\nyato yato ni\u015bcalati\n\n\nmana\u015b ca\u00f1calam asthiram\n\n\ntatas tato niyamyaitad\n\n\n\u0101tmany eva va\u015ba\u1e41 nayet\n\n\nyata\u1e25\u2014whatever; yata\u1e25\u2014wherever; ni\u015bcalati\u2014verily agitated; mana\u1e25\u2014the mind;\nca\u00f1calam\u2014flickering; asthiram\u2014unsteady; tata\u1e25\u2014from there; tata\u1e25\u2014and thereafter;\nniyamya\u2014regulating; etat\u2014this; \u0101tmani\u2014in the self; eva\u2014certainly; va\u015bam\u2014control;\nnayet\u2014must bring in.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nFrom whatever and wherever the mind wanders due to its flickering and unsteady\nnature, one must certainly withdraw it and bring it back under the control of\nthe Self.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe nature of the mind is flickering and unsteady. But a self-realized yog\u012b has\nto control the mind; the mind should not control him. One who controls the mind\n(and therefore the senses as well) is called gosv\u0101m\u012b, or sv\u0101m\u012b, and one who is\ncontrolled by the mind is called god\u0101sa, or the servant of the senses. A gosv\u0101m\u012b\nknows the standard of sense happiness. In transcendental sense happiness, the\nsenses are engaged in the service of H\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba or the supreme owner of the\nsenses\u2014K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Serving K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a with purified senses is called K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\nThat is the way of bringing the senses under full control. What is more, that is\nthe highest perfection of yoga practice.\n\n\n6.27\n\n\npra\u015b\u0101nta-manasa\u1e41 hy ena\u1e41\n\n\nyogina\u1e41 sukham uttamam\n\n\nupaiti \u015b\u0101nta-rajasa\u1e41\n\n\nbrahma-bh\u016btam akalma\u1e63am\n\n\npra\u015b\u0101nta\u2014mind fixed on the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; manasam\u2014of one whose mind is so\nfixed; hi\u2014certainly; enam\u2014this; yoginam\u2014the yog\u012b; sukham\u2014happiness; uttamam\u2014the\nhighest; upaiti\u2014attains; \u015b\u0101nta-rajasam\u2014pacified passion; brahma-bh\u016btam\u2014liberated\nby identification with the Absolute; akalma\u1e63am\u2014freed from all past sinful\nreaction.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThe yog\u012b whose mind is fixed on Me verily attains the highest happiness. By\nvirtue of his identity with Brahman, he is liberated; his mind is peaceful, his\npassions are quieted, and he is freed from sin.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nBrahma-bh\u016bta is the state of being free from material contamination and situated\nin the transcendental service of the Lord. Mad-bhaktim labhate par\u0101m (### .\n18.54). One cannot remain in the quality of Brahman, the Absolute, until one\u2019s\nmind is fixed on the lotus feet of the Lord.

Indeed,\nthe self-realized man sees Me everywhere.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nA K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious yog\u012b is the perfect seer because he sees K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme,\nsituated in everyone\u2019s heart as Supersoul (Param\u0101tm\u0101). \u012a\u015bvara\u1e25 sarva-bh\u016bt\u0101n\u0101\u1e41\nh\u1e5bd-de\u015be \u2019rjuna ti\u1e63\u1e6dhati. The Lord in His Param\u0101tm\u0101 feature is situated within\nboth the heart of the dog and that of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a. The perfect yog\u012b knows that\nthe Lord is eternally transcendental and is not materially affected by His\npresence in either a dog or a br\u0101hma\u1e47a. That is the supreme neutrality of the\nLord. The individual soul is also situated in the individual heart, but he is\nnot present in all hearts. That is the distinction between the individual soul\nand the Supersoul. One who is not factually in the practice of yoga cannot see\nso clearly. A K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person can see K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in the heart of both the\nbeliever and nonbeliever. In the sm\u1e5bti this is confirmed as follows: \u0101tatatv\u0101c\nca m\u0101t\u1e5btv\u0101d \u0101tm\u0101 hi paramo hari\u1e25.\n\n\nThe Lord, being the source of all beings, is like the mother and the maintainer.\nAs the mother is neutral to all different kinds of children, the Supreme Father\n(or Mother) is also. Consequently the Supersoul is always in every living being.\nOutwardly, also, every living being is situated in the energy of the Lord. As\nwill be explained in the Seventh Chapter, the Lord has, primarily, two\nenergies\u2014the spiritual (or superior) and the material (or inferior). The living\nentity, although part of the superior energy, is conditioned by the inferior\nenergy; the living entity is always in the Lord\u2019s energy. Every living entity is\nsituated in Him in one way or another. The yog\u012b sees equally because he sees\nthat all living entities, although in different situations according to the\nresults of fruitive work, in all circumstances remain the servants of God. While\nin the material energy, the living entity serves the material senses; and while\nin spiritual energy, he serves the Supreme Lord directly. In either case the\nliving entity is the servant of God. This vision of equality is perfect in a\nperson in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\n\n\n6.30\n\n\nyo m\u0101\u1e41 pa\u015byati sarvatra\n\n\nsarva\u1e41 ca mayi pa\u015byati\n\n\ntasy\u0101ha\u1e41 na pra\u1e47a\u015by\u0101mi\n\n\nsa ca me na pra\u1e47a\u015byati\n\n\nya\u1e25\u2014whoever; m\u0101m\u2014Me; pa\u015byati\u2014sees; sarvatra\u2014everywhere; sarvam\u2014everything;\nca\u2014and; mayi\u2014in Me; pa\u015byati\u2014he sees; tasya\u2014his; aham\u2014I; na\u2014not; pra\u1e47a\u015by\u0101mi\u2014am\nlost; sa\u1e25\u2014he; ca\u2014also; me\u2014to Me; na\u2014nor; pra\u1e47a\u015byati\u2014is lost.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nFor one who sees Me everywhere and sees everything in Me, I am never lost, nor\nis he ever lost to Me.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nA person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness certainly sees Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a everywhere, and he\nsees everything in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Such a person may appear to see all separate\nmanifestations of the material nature, but in each and every instance he is\nconscious of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, knowing that everything is the manifestation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s\nenergy. Nothing can exist without K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Lord of\neverything\u2014this is the basic principle of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\n\n\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is the development of love of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2014a position\ntranscendental even to material liberation. It is the stage beyond\nself-realization at which the devotee becomes one with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in the sense that\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a becomes everything for the devotee, and the devotee becomes full in loving\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. An intimate relationship between the Lord and the devotee then exists. In\nthat stage, the living entity attains his immortality. Nor is the Personality of\nGodhead ever out of the sight of the devotee. To merge in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is spiritual\nannihilation. A devotee takes no such risk.

In the case of a yog\u012b who sees the\nLord as Param\u0101tm\u0101 within the heart, the same applies. Such a yog\u012b turns into a\npure devotee and cannot bear to live for a moment with out seeing the Lord\nwithin himself.\n\n\n6.31\n\n\nsarva-bh\u016bta-sthita\u1e41 yo m\u0101\u1e41\n\n\nbhajaty ekatvam \u0101sthita\u1e25\n\n\nsarvath\u0101 vartam\u0101no \u2019pi\n\n\nsa yog\u012b mayi vartate\n\n\nsarva-bh\u016bta-sthitam\u2014situated in everyone\u2019s heart; ya\u1e25\u2014he who; m\u0101m\u2014unto Me;\nbhajati\u2014serves in devotional service; ekatvam\u2014oneness; \u0101sthita\u1e25\u2014thus situated;\nsarvath\u0101\u2014in all respects; vartam\u0101na\u1e25\u2014being situated; api\u2014in spite of; sa\u1e25\u2014he;\nyog\u012b\u2014transcendentalist; mayi\u2014unto Me; vartate\u2014remains.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThe yog\u012b who knows that I and the Supersoul within all creatures are one\nworships Me and remains always in Me in all circumstances.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nA yog\u012b who is practicing meditation on the Supersoul sees within himself the\nplenary portion of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as Vi\u1e63\u1e47u\u2014with four hands, holding conchshell, wheel,\nclub and lotus flower. The yog\u012b should know that Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is not different from\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in this form of Supersoul is situated in everyone\u2019s heart.\nFurthermore, there is no difference between the innumerable Supersouls present\nin the innumerable hearts of living entities. Nor is there a difference between\na K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person always engaged in the transcendental loving service of\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and a perfect yog\u012b engaged in meditation on the Supersoul. The yog\u012b in\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness\u2014even though he may be engaged in various activities while in\nmaterial existence\u2014remains always situated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This is confirmed in the\nBhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu of \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b: nikhile\u1e63u avasth\u0101su j\u012bvanmukta sa\nucyate. A devotee of the Lord, always acting in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, is\nautomatically liberated. In the N\u0101rada-pa\u00f1car\u0101tra this is confirmed in this way:\n\n\ndik-k\u0101l\u0101dy-anavacchinne k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47e ceto vidh\u0101ya ca tanmayo bhavati k\u1e63ipra\u1e41 j\u012bvo\nbrahma\u1e47i yojayet.\n\n\n\u201cBy concentrating one\u2019s attention on the transcendental form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who is\nall-pervading and beyond time and space, one becomes absorbed in thinking of\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and then attains the happy state of transcendental association with Him.\u201d\n\n\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is the highest stage of trance in yoga practice. This very\nunderstanding that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is present as Param\u0101tm\u0101 in everyone\u2019s heart makes the\nyog\u012b faultless.

The cause of the\ndistress of a living entity is forgetfulness of his relationship with God. And\nthe cause of happiness is knowing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to be the supreme enjoyer of all the\nactivities of the human being. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the proprietor of all lands and planets.\nThe perfect yog\u012b is the sincerest friend of all living entities. He knows that\nthe living being who is conditioned by the modes of material nature is subjected\nto the threefold material miseries due to forgetfulness of his relationship with\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Because one in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is happy, he tries to distribute the\nknowledge of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a everywhere. Since the perfect yog\u012b tries to broadcast the\nimportance of becoming K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, he is the best philanthropist in the\nworld, and he is the dearest servitor of the Lord. Na tasm\u0101t ka\u015bcid me priyak\u1e5bt\ntama\u1e25. In other words, a devotee of the Lord always looks to the welfare of all\nliving entities, and in this way he is factually the friend of everyone. He is\nthe best yog\u012b because he does not desire perfection in yoga for his personal\nbenefit, but tries for others also. He does not envy his fellow living entities.\nHere is a contrast between a pure devotee of the Lord and a yog\u012b interested only\nin his personal elevation. The yog\u012b who has withdrawn to a secluded place in\norder to meditate perfectly may not be as perfect as a devotee who is trying his\nbest to turn every man toward K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\n\n\n6.33\n\n\narjuna uv\u0101ca\n\n\nyo \u2019ya\u1e41 yogas tvay\u0101 prokta\u1e25\n\n\ns\u0101myena madhus\u016bdana\n\n\netasy\u0101ha\u1e41 na pa\u015by\u0101mi\n\n\nca\u00f1calatv\u0101t sthiti\u1e41 sthir\u0101m\n\n\narjuna\u1e25 uv\u0101ca\u2014Arjuna said; ya\u1e25\u2014the system; ayam\u2014this; yoga\u1e25\u2014mysticism; tvay\u0101\u2014by\nYou; prokta\u1e25\u2014described; s\u0101myena\u2014generally; madhus\u016bdana\u2014O killer of the demon\nMadhu; etasya\u2014of this; aham\u2014I; na\u2014do not; pa\u015by\u0101mi\u2014see; ca\u00f1calatv\u0101t\u2014due to being\nrestless; sthitim\u2014situation; sthir\u0101m\u2014stable.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nArjuna said: O Madhus\u016bdana, the system of yoga which you have summarized appears\nimpractical and unendurable to me, for the mind is restless and unsteady.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe system of mysticism described by Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to Arjuna beginning with the\nwords \u015bucau de\u015be and ending with yog\u012b parama\u1e25 is here being rejected by Arjuna\nout of a feeling of inability. It is not possible for an ordinary man to leave\nhome and go to a secluded place in the mountains or jungles to practice yoga in\nthis age of Kali. The present age is characterized by a bitter struggle for a\nlife of short duration. People are not serious about self-realization even by\nsimple, practical means, and what to speak of this difficult yoga system, which\nregulates the mode of living, the manner of sitting, selection of place, and\ndetachment of the mind from material engagements. As a practical man, Arjuna\nthought it was impossible to follow this system of yoga, even though he was\nfavorably endowed in many ways. He belonged to the royal family and was highly\nelevated in terms of numerous qualities; he was a great warrior, he had great\nlongevity, and, above all, he was the most intimate friend of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead. Five thousand years ago, Arjuna had much better\nfacilities then we do now, yet he refused to accept this system of yoga. In\nfact, we do not find any record in history of his practicing it at any time.\nTherefore this system must be considered generally impossible in this age of\nKali. Of course it may be possible for some very few, rare men, but for the\npeople in general it is an impossible proposal. If this were so five thousand\nyears ago, then what of the present day? Those who are imitating this yoga\nsystem in different so-called schools and societies, although complacent, are\ncertainly wasting their time. They are completely in ignorance of the desired\ngoal.\n\n\n6.34\n\n\nca\u00f1cala\u1e41 hi mana\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\n\n\npram\u0101thi balavad d\u1e5b\u1e0dham\n\n\ntasy\u0101ha\u1e41 nigraha\u1e41 manye\n\n\nv\u0101yor iva su-du\u1e63karam\n\n\nca\u00f1calam\u2014flickering; hi\u2014certainly; mana\u1e25\u2014mind; k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2014O K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a;\npram\u0101thi\u2014agitating; balavat\u2014strong; d\u1e5b\u1e0dham\u2014obstinate; tasya\u2014its; aham\u2014I;\nnigraham\u2014subduing; manye\u2014think; v\u0101yo\u1e25\u2014of the wind; iva\u2014like;\nsudu\u1e63karam\u2014difficult.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nFor the mind is restless, turbulent, obstinate and very strong, O K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and to\nsubdue it is, it seems to me, more difficult than controlling the wind.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe mind is so strong and obstinate that it sometimes overcomes the\nintelligence, although mind is supposed to be subservient to the intelligence.\nFor a man in the practical world who has to fight so many opposing elements, it\nis certainly very difficult to control the mind. Artificially, one may establish\na mental equilibrium toward both friend and enemy, but ultimately no worldly man\ncan do so, for this is more difficult than controlling the raging wind. In the\nVedic literatures it is said:\n\n\n\u0101tm\u0101na\u1e41 rathina\u1e41 viddhi \u015bar\u012bra\u1e41 ratham eva ca buddhintu s\u0101rathi\u1e41 viddhi mana\u1e25\npragraham eva ca indriy\u0101\u1e47i hay\u0101n\u0101hur vi\u1e63ay\u0101\u1e41s te\u1e63u gocar\u0101n \u0101tmendriya-mano-yukto\nbhoktety \u0101hur man\u012b\u1e63i\u1e47a\u1e25.\n\n\n\u201cThe individual is the passenger in the car of the material body, and\nintelligence is the driver. Mind is the driving instrument, and the senses are\nthe horses. The self is thus the enjoyer or sufferer in the association of the\nmind and senses. So it is understood by great thinkers.\u201d Intelligence is\nsupposed to direct the mind, but the mind is so strong and obstinate that it\noften overcomes even one\u2019s own intelligence. Such a strong mind is supposed to\nbe controlled by the practice of yoga, but such practice is never practical for\na worldly person like Arjuna. And what can we say of modern man? The simile used\nhere is appropriate: one cannot capture the blowing wind. And it is even more\ndifficult to capture the turbulent mind. The easiest way to control the mind, as\nsuggested by Lord Caitanya, is chanting \u201cHare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a,\u201d the great mantra for\ndeliverance, in all humility. The method prescribed is sa vai mana\u1e25\nk\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-pad\u0101ravindayo\u1e25: one must engage one\u2019s mind fully in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.

But at the same time He suggests that by\npractice and detachment it is possible. What is that practice? In the present\nage no one can observe strict rules and regulations, such as placing oneself in\na sacred place, focusing the mind on the Supersoul, restraining the senses and\nmind, observing celibacy, remaining alone, etc. By the practice of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness, however, one engages in nine types of devotional service to the\nLord. The first and foremost of such devotional engagements is hearing about\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This is a very powerful transcendental method for purging the mind of all\nmisgivings. The more one hears about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the more one becomes enlightened and\ndetached from everything that draws the mind away from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. By detaching the\nmind from activities not devoted to the Lord, one can very easily learn\nvair\u0101gya. Vair\u0101gya means detachment from matter and engagement of the mind in\nspirit. Impersonal spiritual detachment is more difficult than attaching the\nmind to the activities of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This is practical because by hearing about\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a one becomes automatically attached to the Supreme Spirit. This attachment\nis called pare\u015b\u0101nubh\u016bti spiritual satisfaction. It is just like the feeling of\nsatisfaction a hungry man has for every morsel of food he eats. Similarly, by\ndischarge of devotional service, one feels transcendental satisfaction as the\nmind becomes detached from material objectives. It is something like curing a\ndisease by expert treatment and appropriate diet. Hearing of the transcendental\nactivities of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is therefore expert treatment for the mad mind, and\neating the foodstuff offered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the appropriate diet for the suffering\npatient. This treatment is the process of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\n\n\n6.36\n\n\nasa\u1e41yat\u0101tman\u0101 yogo\n\n\ndu\u1e63pr\u0101pa iti me mati\u1e25\n\n\nva\u015by\u0101tman\u0101 tu yatat\u0101\n\n\n\u015bakyo \u2019v\u0101ptum up\u0101yata\u1e25\n\n\nasa\u1e41yata\u2014unbridled; \u0101tman\u0101\u2014by the mind; yoga\u1e25\u2014self-realization;\ndu\u1e63pr\u0101pa\u1e25\u2014difficult to obtain; iti\u2014thus; me\u2014My; mati\u1e25\u2014opinion; va\u015bya\u2014controlled;\n\u0101tman\u0101\u2014by the mind; tu\u2014but; yatat\u0101\u2014while endeavoring; \u015bakya\u1e25\u2014practical;\nav\u0101ptum\u2014to achieve; up\u0101yata\u1e25\u2014appropriate means.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nFor one whose mind is unbridled, self-realization is difficult work. But he\nwhose mind is controlled and who strives by right means is assured of success.\nThat is My opinion.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe Supreme Personality of Godhead declares that one who does not accept the\nproper treatment to detach the mind from material engagement can hardly achieve\nsuccess in self-realization. Trying to practice yoga while engaging the mind in\nmaterial enjoyment is like trying to ignite a fire while pouring water on it.\nSimilarly, yoga practice without mental control is a waste of time. Such a show\nof yoga practice may be materially lucrative, but it is useless as far as\nspiritual realization is concerned. Therefore, the mind must be controlled by\nengaging it constantly in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. Unless\none is engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, he cannot steadily control the mind. A\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person easily achieves the result of yoga practice without\nseparate endeavor, but a yoga practitioner cannot achieve success without\nbecoming K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious.\n\n\n6.37\n\n\narjuna uv\u0101ca\n\n\nayati\u1e25 \u015braddhayopeto\n\n\nyog\u0101c calita-m\u0101nasa\u1e25\n\n\napr\u0101pya yoga-sa\u1e41siddhi\u1e41\n\n\nk\u0101\u1e41 gati\u1e41 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a gacchati\n\n\narjuna\u1e25 uv\u0101ca\u2014Arjuna said; ayati\u1e25\u2014unsuccessful transcendentalist; \u015braddhay\u0101\u2014with\nfaith; upeta\u1e25\u2014engaged; yog\u0101t\u2014from the mystic link; calita\u2014deviated; m\u0101nasa\u1e25\u2014of\none who has such a mind; apr\u0101pya\u2014failing; yoga-sa\u1e41siddhim\u2014highest perfection in\nmysticism; k\u0101m\u2014which; gatim\u2014destination; k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2014O K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; gacchati\u2014achieves.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nArjuna said: What is the destination of the man of faith who does not persevere,\nwho in the beginning takes to the process of self-realization but who later\ndesists due to worldly-mindedness and thus does not attain perfection in\nmysticism?\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe path of self-realization or mysticism is described in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. The\nbasic principle of self-realization is knowledge that the living entity is not\nthis material body but that he is different from it and that his happiness is in\neternal life, bliss and knowledge. These are transcendental, beyond both body\nand mind. Self-realization is sought by the path of knowledge, the practice of\nthe eightfold system or by bhakti-yoga. In each of these processes one has to\nrealize the constitutional position of the living entity, his relationship with\nGod, and the activities whereby he can reestablish the lost link and achieve the\nhighest perfectional stage of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Following any of the\nabove-mentioned three methods, one is sure to reach the supreme goal sooner or\nlater. This was asserted by the Lord in the Second Chapter: even a little\nendeavor on the transcendental path offers a great hope for deliverance. Out of\nthese three methods, the path of bhakti-yoga is especially suitable for this age\nbecause it is the most direct method of God realization. To be doubly assured,\nArjuna is asking Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to confirm His former statement. One may sincerely\naccept the path of self-realization, but the process of cultivation of knowledge\nand the practice of the eightfold yoga system are generally very difficult for\nthis age. Therefore, despite constant endeavor, one may fail for many reasons.\nFirst of all, one may not be following the process. To pursue the transcendental\npath is more or less to declare war on illusory energy. Consequently, whenever a\nperson tries to escape the clutches of the illusory energy, she tries to defeat\nthe practitioner by various allurements. A conditioned soul is already allured\nby the modes of material energy, and there is every chance of being allured\nagain, even while performing transcendental disciplines. This is called yog\u0101t\ncalita-m\u0101nasa\u1e25: deviation from the transcendental path.

Those who are materialists have no interest in\nTranscendence; therefore they are more interested in material advancement by\neconomic development, or in promotion to the higher planets by appropriate work.\nWhen one takes to the path of Transcendence, one has to cease all material\nactivities and sacrifice all forms of so-called material happiness. If the\naspiring transcendentalist fails, then he apparently loses both ways; in other\nwords, he can enjoy neither material happiness nor spiritual success. He has no\nposition; he is like a riven cloud. A cloud in the sky sometimes deviates from a\nsmall cloud and joins a big one. But if it cannot join a big one, then it is\nblown away by the wind and becomes a nonentity in the vast sky. The brahma\u1e47a\u1e25\npathi is the path of transcendental realization through knowing oneself to be\nspiritual in essence, part and parcel of the Supreme Lord who is manifested as\nBrahman, Param\u0101tm\u0101 and Bhagav\u0101n. Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the fullest manifestation of\nthe Supreme Absolute Truth, and therefore one who is surrendered to the Supreme\nPerson is a successful transcendentalist. To reach this goal of life through\nBrahman and Param\u0101tm\u0101 realization takes many, many births: Bah\u016bn\u0101\u1e41 janman\u0101m\nante. Therefore the supermost of transcendental realization is bhakti-yoga or\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, the direct method.\n\n\n6.39\n\n\netan me sa\u1e41\u015baya\u1e41 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\n\n\nchettum arhasy a\u015be\u1e63ata\u1e25\n\n\ntvad-anya\u1e25 sa\u1e41\u015bayasy\u0101sya\n\n\nchett\u0101 na hy upapadyate\n\n\netat\u2014this is; me\u2014my; sa\u1e41\u015bayam\u2014doubt; k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2014O K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; chettum\u2014to dispel;\narhasi\u2014requested to do; a\u015be\u1e63ata\u1e25\u2014completely; tvat\u2014Yourself; anya\u1e25\u2014without;\nsa\u1e41\u015bay\u0101sya\u2014of the doubt; asya\u2014of this; chett\u0101\u2014remover; na\u2014never; hi\u2014certainly;\nupapadyate\u2014to be found.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThis is my doubt O K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and I ask You to dispel it completely. But for\nYourself, no one is to be found who can destroy this doubt.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the perfect knower of past, present and future. In the beginning of the\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, the Lord said that all living entities exist individually in the\npast, that they exist now in the present, and that they continue to retain\nindividual identity in the future, even after liberation from the material\nentanglement. So He has already cleared up the question of the future of the\nindividual living entity. Now, Arjuna wants to know of the future of the\nunsuccessful transcendentalist. No one is equal to or above K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and certainly\nthe so-called great sages and philosophers who are at the mercy of material\nnature cannot equal Him. Therefore the verdict of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the final and\ncomplete answer to all doubts because He knows past, present and future\nperfectly\u2014but no one knows Him. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious devotees alone can\nknow what is what.\n\n\n6.40\n\n\n\u015br\u012b-bhagav\u0101n uv\u0101ca\n\n\np\u0101rtha naiveha n\u0101mutra\n\n\nvin\u0101\u015bas tasya vidyate\n\n\nna hi kaly\u0101\u1e47a-k\u1e5bt ka\u015bcid\n\n\ndurgati\u1e41 t\u0101ta gacchati\n\n\n\u015br\u012b bhagav\u0101n uv\u0101ca\u2014the Supreme Personality of Godhead said; p\u0101rtha\u2014O son of\nPrth\u0101; na eva\u2014never is it so; iha\u2014in this material world; na\u2014never; amutra\u2014in\nthe next life; vin\u0101\u015ba\u1e25\u2014destruction; tasya\u2014his; vidyate\u2014exists; na\u2014never;\nhi\u2014certainly; kaly\u0101\u1e47a-k\u1e5bt\u2014one who is engaged in auspicious activities;\nka\u015bcit\u2014anyone; durgatim\u2014degradation; t\u0101ta\u2014thereafter; gacchati\u2014going.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThe Blessed Lord said: Son of P\u1e5bth\u0101, a transcendentalist engaged in auspicious\nactivities does not meet with destruction either in this world or in the\nspiritual world; one who does good, My friend, is never overcome by evil.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nIn the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (1.5.17) \u015ar\u012b N\u0101rada Muni instructs Vy\u0101sadeva as\nfollows:\n\n\ntyaktv\u0101 sva-dharma\u1e41 cara\u1e47\u0101mbuja\u1e41 harer bhajann apakko \u2019tha patet tato yadi yatra\nkva v\u0101bhadram abh\u016bd amu\u1e63ya ki\u1e41 ko v\u0101rtha \u0101pto \u2019bhajat\u0101\u1e41 sva-dharmata\u1e25\n\n\n\u201cIf someone gives up all material prospects and takes complete shelter of the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead, there is no loss or degradation in any way. On\nthe other hand a nondevotee may fully engage in his occupational duties and yet\nnot gain anything.\u201d For material prospects, there are many activities both\nscriptural and customary. A transcendentalist is supposed to give up all\nmaterial activities for the sake of spiritual advancement in life, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness. One may argue that by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness one may attain the\nhighest perfection if it is completed, but if one does not attain such a\nperfectional stage, then he loses both materially and spiritually. It is\nenjoined in the scriptures that one has to suffer the reaction of not executing\nprescribed duties; therefore one who fails to discharge transcendental\nactivities properly becomes subjected to these reactions. The Bh\u0101gavatam assures\nthe unsuccessful transcendentalist that there need be no worries. Even though he\nmay be subjected to the reaction of not perfectly executing prescribed duties,\nhe is still not a loser, because auspicious K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is never\nforgotten, and one so engaged will continue to be so even if he is lowborn in\nthe next life. On the other hand, one who simply follows strictly the prescribed\nduties need not necessarily attain auspicious results if he is lacking in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness.\n\n\nThe purport may be understood as follows: humanity may be divided into two\nsections, namely, the regulated and the nonregulated. Those who are engaged\nsimply in bestial sense gratifications without knowledge of their next life or\nspiritual salvation belong to the nonregulated section. And those who follow the\nprinciples of prescribed duties in the scriptures are classified amongst the\nregulated section. The nonregulated section, both civilized and noncivilized,\neducated and noneducated, strong and weak, are full of animal propensities.\nTheir activities are never auspicious because, enjoying the animal propensities\nof eating, sleeping, defending and mating, they perpetually remain in material\nexistence, which is always miserable. On the other hand, those who are regulated\nby scriptural injunctions and thus gradually rise to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness\ncertainly progress in life.\n\n\nThose who are then following the path of auspiciousness can be divided into\nthree sections, namely, 1) the followers of scriptural rules and regulations who\nare enjoying material prosperity, 2) those who are trying to find out the\nultimate liberation from material existence, and 3) those who are devotees in\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Those who are following the rules and regulations of the\nscriptures for material happiness may be further divided into two classes: those\nwho are fruitive workers and those who desire no fruit for sense gratification.\nThose who are after fruitive results for sense gratification may be elevated to\na higher standard of life\u2014even to the higher planets; but still, because they\nare not free from material existence, they are not following the truly\nauspicious path. The only auspicious activities are those which lead one to\nliberation. Any activity which is not aimed at ultimate self-realization or\nliberation from the material bodily concept of life is not at all auspicious.\nActivity in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is the only auspicious activity, and anyone who\nvoluntarily accepts all bodily discomforts for the sake of making progress on\nthe path of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness can be called a perfect transcendentalist under\nsevere austerity. And because the eightfold yoga system is directed toward the\nultimate realization of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, such practice is also auspicious,\nand no one who is trying his best in this matter need fear degradation.\n\n\n6.41\n\n\npr\u0101pya pu\u1e47ya-k\u1e5bt\u0101\u1e41 lok\u0101n\n\n\nu\u1e63itv\u0101 \u015b\u0101\u015bvat\u012b\u1e25 sam\u0101\u1e25\n\n\n\u015buc\u012bn\u0101\u1e41 \u015br\u012bmat\u0101\u1e41 gehe\n\n\nyoga-bhra\u1e63\u1e6do \u2019bhij\u0101yate\n\n\npr\u0101pya\u2014after achieving; pu\u1e47ya-k\u1e5bt\u0101m\u2014of those who performed pious activities;\nlok\u0101n\u2014planets; u\u1e63itv\u0101\u2014after dwelling; \u015b\u0101\u015bvat\u012b\u1e25\u2014many; sam\u0101\u1e25\u2014years; \u015buc\u012bn\u0101m\u2014of the\npious; \u015br\u012bmat\u0101m\u2014of the prosperous; gehe\u2014in the house of; yoga-bhra\u1e63\u1e6da\u1e25\u2014one who\nis fallen from the path of self-realization; abhij\u0101yate\u2014takes his birth.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThe unsuccessful yog\u012b, after many, many years of enjoyment on the planets of the\npious living entities, is born into a family of righteous people, or into a\nfamily of rich aristocracy.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe unsuccessful yog\u012bs are divided into two classes: one is fallen after very\nlittle progress, and one is fallen after long practice of yoga.

After prolonged life there, he is sent\nback again to this planet, to take birth in the family of a righteous br\u0101hma\u1e47a\nvai\u1e63\u1e47ava or of aristocratic merchants.\n\n\nThe real purpose of yoga practice is to achieve the highest perfection of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness. But those who do not persevere to such an extent and fail due to\nmaterial allurements are allowed, by the grace of the Lord, to make full\nutilization of their material propensities.

It is especially the case in the\n\u0101c\u0101rya or gosv\u0101m\u012b families. Such families are very learned and devoted by\ntradition and training, and thus they become spiritual masters. In India there\nare many such \u0101c\u0101rya families, but they have now degenerated due to insufficient\neducation and training. By the grace of the Lord, there are still families that\nfoster transcendentalists generation after generation. It is certainly very\nfortunate to take birth in such families.

Formerly it was known as\nIl\u0101vartavar\u1e63a. The Emperor, at an early age, retired for spiritual perfection\nbut failed to achieve success. In his next life he took birth in the family of a\ngood br\u0101hma\u1e47a and was known as Ja\u1e0dabharata because he always remained secluded\nand did not talk to anyone. And later on, he was discovered as the greatest\ntranscendentalist by King Rah\u016bga\u1e47a. From his life it is understood that\ntranscendental endeavors, or the practice of yoga, never go in vain.

In the\n\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (3.33.8), such disregard of Vedic rituals by the advanced\ntranscendentalists is explained as follows:\n\n\naho bata \u015bvapaco \u2019to gar\u012by\u0101n yajjihv\u0101gre vartate n\u0101ma tubhyam tepus tapas te\njuhuvu\u1e25 sasnur \u0101ry\u0101 brahm\u0101n\u016bcur n\u0101ma g\u1e5b\u1e47anti ye te.\n\n\n\u201cO my Lord! Persons who chant the holy names of Your Lordship are far, far\nadvanced in spiritual life, even if born in families of dog-eaters. Such\nchanters have undoubtedly performed all kinds of austerities and sacrifices,\nbathed in all sacred places, and finished all scriptural studies.\u201d\n\n\nThe famous example of this was presented by Lord Caitanya, who accepted \u1e6ch\u0101kur\nHarid\u0101sa as one of His most important disciples. Although \u1e6ch\u0101kur Harid\u0101sa\nhappened to take his birth in a Moslem family, he was elevated to the post of\nn\u0101m\u0101c\u0101rya by Lord Caitanya due to his rigidly attended principle of chanting\nthree hundred thousand holy names of the Lord daily: Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a,\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare. And because\nhe chanted the holy name of the Lord constantly, it is understood that in his\nprevious life he must have passed through all the ritualistic methods of the\nVedas, known as \u015babda-brahman. Unless, therefore, one is purified, one cannot\ntake to the principle of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness nor become engaged in chanting the\nholy name of the Lord, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\n\n\n6.45\n\n\nprayatn\u0101d yatam\u0101nas tu\n\n\nyog\u012b sa\u1e41\u015buddha-kilbi\u1e63a\u1e25\n\n\naneka-janma-sa\u1e41siddhas\n\n\ntato y\u0101ti par\u0101\u1e41 gatim\n\n\nprayatn\u0101t\u2014by rigid practice; yatam\u0101na\u1e25\u2014one who endeavors; tu\u2014but; yog\u012b\u2014such a\ntranscendentalist; sa\u1e41\u015buddha\u2014washed off; kilbi\u1e63a\u1e25\u2014all kinds of sins; aneka\u2014many,\nmany; janma\u2014births; sa\u1e41siddha\u1e25\u2014so achieved perfection; tata\u1e25\u2014thereafter;\ny\u0101ti\u2014attains; par\u0101m\u2014highest; gatim\u2014destination.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nBut when the yog\u012b engages himself with sincere endeavor in making further\nprogress, being washed of all contaminations, then ultimately, after many, many\nbirths of practice, he attains the supreme goal.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nA person born in a particularly righteous, aristocratic or sacred family becomes\nconscious of his favorable condition for executing yoga practice.

This is\nconfirmed in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101:\n\n\nye\u1e63\u0101\u1e41 tvanta-gata\u1e41 p\u0101pa\u1e41 jan\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 pu\u1e47ya-karma\u1e47\u0101m te dvandva-moha-nirmukt\u0101\nbhajante m\u0101\u1e41 d\u1e5b\u1e0dha-vrat\u0101\u1e25\n\n\n\u201cAfter many, many births of executing pious activities, when one is completely\nfreed from all contaminations, and from all illusory dualities, one then becomes\nengaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord.\u201d\n\n\n6.46\n\n\ntapasvibhyo \u2019dhiko yog\u012b\n\n\nj\u00f1\u0101nibhyo \u2019pi mato \u2019dhika\u1e25\n\n\nkarmibhya\u015b c\u0101dhiko yog\u012b\n\n\ntasm\u0101d yog\u012b bhav\u0101rjuna\n\n\ntapasvibhya\u1e25\u2014than the ascetic; adhika\u1e25\u2014greater; yog\u012b\u2014the yog\u012b; j\u00f1\u0101nibhya\u1e25\u2014than\nthe wise; api\u2014also; mata\u1e25\u2014considered; adhika\u1e25\u2014greater than; karmibhya\u1e25\u2014than the\nfruitive worker; ca\u2014also; adhika\u1e25\u2014greater than; yog\u012b\u2014the yog\u012b; tasm\u0101t\u2014therefore;\nyog\u012b\u2014a transcendentalist; bhava\u2014just become; arjuna\u2014O Arjuna.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nA yog\u012b is greater than the ascetic, greater than the empiricist and greater than\nthe fruitive worker. Therefore, O Arjuna, in all circumstances, be a yog\u012b.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nWhen we speak of yoga we refer to linking up our consciousness with the Supreme\nAbsolute Truth. Such a process is named differently by various practitioners in\nterms of the particular method adopted. When the linking up process is\npredominantly in fruitive activities, it is called karma-yoga, when it is\npredominantly empirical, it is called j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga, and when it is predominantly\nin a devotional relationship with the Supreme Lord, it is called bhakti-yoga.\nBhakti-yoga or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is the ultimate perfection of all yogas, as\nwill be explained in the next verse. The Lord has confirmed herein the\nsuperiority of yoga, but He has not mentioned that it is better than\nbhakti-yoga. Bhakti-yoga is full spiritual knowledge, and as such, nothing can\nexcel it. Asceticism without self-knowledge is imperfect. Empiric knowledge\nwithout surrender to the Supreme Lord is also imperfect. And fruitive work\nwithout K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is a waste of time. Therefore, the most highly\npraised form of yoga performance mentioned here is bhakti-yoga, and this is\nstill more clearly explained in the next verse.\n\n\n6.47\n\n\nyogin\u0101m api sarve\u1e63\u0101\u1e41\n\n\nmad-gaten\u0101ntar-\u0101tman\u0101\n\n\n\u015braddh\u0101v\u0101n bhajate yo m\u0101\u1e41\n\n\nsa me yuktatamo mata\u1e25\n\n\nyogin\u0101m\u2014of all yog\u012bs; api\u2014also; sarve\u1e63\u0101m\u2014all types of; mat-gatena\u2014abiding in Me;\nanta\u1e25-\u0101tman\u0101\u2014always thinking of Me within; \u015braddh\u0101v\u0101n\u2014in full faith;\nbhajate\u2014renders transcendental loving service; ya\u1e25\u2014one who; m\u0101m\u2014Me (the Supreme\nLord); sa\u1e25\u2014he; me\u2014Mine; yuktatama\u1e25\u2014the greatest yog\u012b; mata\u1e25\u2014is considered.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nAnd of all yog\u012bs, he who always abides in Me with great faith, worshiping Me in\ntranscendental loving service, is most intimately united with Me in yoga and is\nthe highest of all.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe word bhajete is significant here. Bhajete has its root in the verb bhaj,\nwhich is used when there is need of service. The English word \u201cworship\u201d cannot\nbe used in the same sense as bhaja. Worship means to adore, or to show respect\nand honor to the worthy one. But service with love and faith is especially meant\nfor the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One can avoid worshiping a respectable\nman or a demigod and may be called discourteous, but one cannot avoid serving\nthe Supreme Lord without being thoroughly condemned. Every living entity is part\nand parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and thus every living entity\nis intended to serve the Supreme Lord by his own constitution. Failing to do\nthis, he falls down. The Bh\u0101gavatam confirms this as follows:\n\n\nya e\u1e63\u0101\u1e41 puru\u1e63a\u1e41 s\u0101k\u1e63\u0101d \u0101tma-prabhavam \u012b\u015bvaram na bhajanty avaj\u0101nanti sth\u0101n\u0101d\nbhra\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101 patanty adha\u1e25.\n\n\n\u201cAnyone who does not render service and neglects his duty unto the Primeval\nLord, who is the source of all living entities, will certainly fall down from\nhis constitutional position.\u201d\n\n\nIn this verse also the word bhajanti is used. Therefore, bhajanti is applicable\nto the Supreme Lord only, whereas the word \u201cworship\u201d can be applied to demigods\nor to any other common living entity. The word avaj\u0101nanti, used in this verse of\n\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, is also found in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101: avaj\u0101nanti m\u0101\u1e41 m\u016b\u1e0dh\u0101\u1e25:\n\u201cOnly the fools and rascals deride the Supreme Personality of Godhead Lord\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u201d Such fools take it upon themselves to write commentaries on the\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 without an attitude of service to the Lord. Consequently they\ncannot properly distinguish between the word bhajanti and the word \u201cworship.\u201d\n\n\nThe culmination of all kinds of yoga practices lies in bhakti-yoga. All other\nyogas are but means to come to the point of bhakti in bhakti-yoga. Yoga actually\nmeans bhakti-yoga; all other yogas are progressions toward the destination of\nbhakti-yoga. From the beginning of karma-yoga to the end of bhakti-yoga is a\nlong way to self-realization. Karma-yoga, without fruitive results, is the\nbeginning of this path. When karma-yoga increases in knowledge and renunciation,\nthe stage is called j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga. When j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga increases in meditation on the\nSupersoul by different physical processes, and the mind is on Him, it is called\na\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45ga-yoga. And, when one surpasses the a\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45ga-yoga and comes to the point of\nthe Supreme Personality of Godhead K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, it is called bhakti-yoga, the\nculmination. Factually, bhakti-yoga is the ultimate goal, but to analyze\nbhakti-yoga minutely one has to understand these other yogas. The yog\u012b who is\nprogressive is therefore on the true path of eternal good fortune. One who\nsticks to a particular point and does not make further progress is called by\nthat particular name: karma-yog\u012b, j\u00f1\u0101na-yog\u012b or dhy\u0101na-yog\u012b, r\u0101ja-yog\u012b,\nha\u1e6dha-yog\u012b, etc. If one is fortunate enough to come to the point of bhakti-yoga,\nit is to be understood that he has surpassed all the other yogas. Therefore, to\nbecome K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious is the highest stage of yoga, just as, when we speak of\nHimalayan, we refer to the world\u2019s highest mountains, of which the highest peak,\nMount Everest, is considered to be the culmination.\n\n\nIt is by great fortune that one comes to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness on the path of\nbhakti-yoga to become well situated according to the Vedic direction. The ideal\nyog\u012b concentrates his attention on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who is called \u015ay\u0101masundara, who is as\nbeautifully colored as a cloud, whose lotus-like face is as effulgent as the\nsun, whose dress is brilliant with jewels and whose body is flower garlanded.\nIlluminating all sides is His gorgeous luster, which is called the brahmajyoti.\nHe incarnates in different forms such as R\u0101ma, N\u1e5bsi\u1e41ha, Var\u0101ha and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead, and He descends like a human being, as the son\nof Mother Ya\u015bod\u0101, and He is known as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Govinda and V\u0101sudeva. He is the\nperfect child, husband, friend and master, and He is full with all opulences and\ntranscendental qualities. If one remains fully conscious of these features of\nthe Lord, he is called the highest yog\u012b.\n\n\nThis stage of highest perfection in yoga can be attained only by bhakti-yoga, as\nis confirmed in all Vedic literature:\n\n\nyasya deve par\u0101 bhaktir yath\u0101 deve tath\u0101 gurau.  tasyaite kathit\u0101 hy arth\u0101\u1e25\nprak\u0101\u015bante mah\u0101tmana\u1e25.\n\n\n\u201cOnly unto those great souls who have implicit faith in both the Lord and the\nspiritual master are all the imports of Vedic knowledge automatically revealed.\u201d\n\n\nBhaktir asya bhajana\u1e41 tadih\u0101mutrop\u0101dhi nair\u0101syen\u0101mu\u1e63min mana\u1e25 kalpanam; etad eva\nnai\u1e63karmyam. \u201cBhakti means devotional service to the Lord which is free from\ndesire for material profit, either in this life or in the next. Devoid of such\ninclinations, one should fully absorb the mind in the Supreme. That is the\npurpose of nai\u1e63karmya.\u201d\n\n\nThese are some of the means for performance of bhakti or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness,\nthe highest perfectional stage of the yoga system.",

TRANSLATION  The Blessed Lord said: One who is unattached to the fruits of his work and who\nworks as he is obligated is in the renounced order of life, and he is the true\nmystic: not he who lights no fire and performs no work.  PURPORT  In this chapter the Lord explains that the process of the eightfold yoga system\nis a means to control the mind and the senses. However, this is very difficult\nfor people in general to perform, especially in the age of Kali. Although the\neightfold yoga system is recommended in this chapter, the Lord emphasizes that\nthe process of karma-yoga, or acting in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, is better. Everyone\nacts in this world to maintain his family and their paraphernalia, but no one is\nworking without some self-interest, some personal gratification, be it\nconcentrated or extended. The criterion of perfection is to act in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness, and not with a view to enjoying the fruits of work. To act in\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is the duty of every living entity because all are\nconstitutionally parts and parcels of the Supreme. The parts of the body work\nfor the satisfaction of the whole body. The limbs of the body do not act for\nself-satisfaction but for the satisfaction of the complete whole. Similarly, the\nliving entity who acts for satisfaction of the supreme whole and not for\npersonal satisfaction is the perfect sanny\u0101s\u012b, the perfect yog\u012b.  The sanny\u0101s\u012bs sometimes artificially think that they have become liberated from\nall material duties, and therefore they cease to perform agnihotra yaj\u00f1as (fire\nsacrifices), but actually they are self-interested because their goal is\nbecoming one with the impersonal Brahman. Such a desire is greater than any\nmaterial desire, but it is not without self-interest. Similarly, the mystic yog\u012b\nwho practices the yoga system with half-open eyes, ceasing all material\nactivities, desires some satisfaction for his personal self. But a person acting\nin K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness works for the satisfaction of the whole, without\nself-interest. A K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person has no desire for self-satisfaction. His\ncriterion of success is the satisfaction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and thus he is the perfect\nsanny\u0101s\u012b, or perfect yog\u012b. Lord Caitanya, the highest perfectional symbol of\nrenunciation, prays in this way:  na dhana\u1e41 na jana\u1e41 na sundar\u012b\u1e41 kavit\u0101\u1e41 v\u0101 jagad\u012b\u015ba k\u0101maye.  mama janmani\njanman\u012b\u015bvare bhavat\u0101d bhaktir ahaituk\u012b tvayi.  \u201cO Almighty Lord, I have no desire to accumulate wealth, nor to enjoy beautiful\nwomen. Nor do I want any number of followers. What I want only is the causeless\nmercy of Your devotional service in my life, birth after birth.\u201d",

TRANSLATION  What is called renunciation is the same as yoga, or linking oneself with the\nSupreme, for no one can become a yog\u012b unless he renounces the desire for sense\ngratification.  PURPORT  Real sanny\u0101sa-yoga or bhakti means that one should know his constitutional\nposition as the living entity, and act accordingly. The living entity has no\nseparate independant identity. He is the marginal energy of the Supreme. When he\nis entrapped by material energy, he is conditioned, and when he is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconscious, or aware of the spiritual energy, then he is in his real and natural\nstate of life. Therefore, when one is in complete knowledge, one ceases all\nmaterial sense gratification, or renounces all kinds of sense gratificatory\nactivities. This is practiced by the yog\u012bs who restrain the senses from material\nattachment. But a person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness has no opportunity to engage his\nsenses in anything which is not for the purpose of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore, a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconscious person is simultaneously a sanny\u0101s\u012b and a yog\u012b. The purpose of\nknowledge and of restraining the senses, as prescribed in the j\u00f1\u0101na and yoga\nprocesses, is automatically served in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. If one is unable to\ngive up the activities of his selfish nature, then j\u00f1\u0101na and yoga are of no\navail. The real aim is for a living entity to give up all selfish satisfaction\nand to be prepared to satisfy the Supreme. A K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person has no\ndesire for any kind of self-enjoyment. He is always engaged for the enjoyment of\nthe Supreme. One who has no information of the Supreme must therefore be engaged\nin self-satisfaction because no one can stand on the platform of inactivity. All\nthese purposes are perfectly served by the practice of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.",

TRANSLATION  For one who is a neophyte in the eightfold yoga system, work is said to be the\nmeans; and for one who has already attained to yoga, cessation of all material\nactivities is said to be the means.  PURPORT  The process of linking oneself with the Supreme is called yoga, which may be\ncompared to a ladder for attaining the topmost spiritual realization. This\nladder begins from the lowest material condition of the living entity and rises\nup to perfect self-realization in pure spiritual life. According to various\nelevations, different parts of the ladder are known by different names. But all\nin all, the complete ladder is called yoga and may be divided into three parts,\nnamely j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga, dhy\u0101na-yoga and bhakti-yoga. The beginning of the ladder is\ncalled the yog\u0101ruruk\u1e63a stage, and the highest rung is called yog\u0101r\u016b\u1e0dha.  Concerning the eightfold yoga system, attempts in the beginning to enter into\nmeditation through regulative principles of life and practice of different\nsitting postures (which are more or less bodily exercises) are considered\nfruitive material activities. All such activities lead to achieving perfect\nmental equilibrium to control the senses. When one is accomplished in the\npractice of meditation, he ceases all disturbing mental activities.  A K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person is, however, situated from the beginning on the\nplatform of meditation because he always thinks of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. And, being constantly\nengaged in the service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he is considered to have ceased all material\nactivities.",

Since the mind is the central point of yoga practice, \u0101tm\u0101\nrefers here to the mind. The purpose of the yoga system is to control the mind\nand to draw it away from attachment to sense objects. It is stressed herein that\nthe mind must be so trained that it can deliver the conditioned soul from the\nmire of nescience. In material existence one is subjected to the influence of\nthe mind and the senses. In fact, the pure soul is entangled in the material\nworld because of the mind\u2019s ego which desires to lord it over material nature.\nTherefore, the mind should be trained so that it will not be attracted by the\nglitter of material nature, and in this way the conditioned soul may be saved.\nOne should not degrade oneself by attraction to sense objects. The more one is\nattracted by sense objects, the more one becomes entangled in material\nexistence. The best way to disentangle oneself is to always engage the mind in\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. The word hi is used for emphasizing this point, i.e., that\none must do this. It is also said:  mana eva manu\u1e63y\u0101\u1e47\u0101\u1e41 k\u0101ra\u1e47a\u1e41 bandha-mok\u1e63ayo\u1e25 bandh\u0101ya vi\u1e63ay\u0101sa\u1e45go muktyai\nnirvi\u1e63aya\u1e41 mana\u1e25.  \u201cFor man, mind is the cause of bondage and mind is the cause of liberation. Mind\nabsorbed in sense objects is the cause of bondage, and mind detached from the\nsense objects is the cause of liberation.\u201d Therefore, the mind which is always\nengaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is the cause of supreme liberation.",

When one\u2019s mind is fixed on\nthe superior nature, he has no other alternative but to follow the dictation of\nthe Supreme. The mind must admit some superior dictation and follow it. The\neffect of controlling the mind is that one automatically follows the dictation\nof the Param\u0101tm\u0101 or Supersoul. Because this transcendental position is at once\nachieved by one who is in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, the devotee of the Lord is\nunaffected by the dualities of material existence, namely distress and\nhappiness, cold and heat, etc. This state is practical sam\u0101dhi, or absorption in\nthe Supreme.",

TRANSLATION  A transcendentalist should always try to concentrate his mind on the Supreme\nSelf; he should live alone in a secluded place and should always carefully\ncontrol his mind. He should be free from desires and feelings of possessiveness.  PURPORT  K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is realized in different degrees as Brahman, Param\u0101tm\u0101 and the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness means, concisely, to be always\nengaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. But those who are\nattached to the impersonal Brahman or the localized Supersoul are also partially\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, because impersonal Brahman is the spiritual ray of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and\nSupersoul is the all-pervading partial expansion of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Thus the\nimpersonalist and the meditator are also indirectly K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious. A directly\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person is the topmost transcendentalist because such a devotee\nknows what is meant by Brahman or Param\u0101tm\u0101. His knowledge of the Absolute Truth\nis perfect, whereas the impersonalist and the meditative yog\u012b are imperfectly\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious.  Nevertheless, all of these are instructed herewith to be constantly engaged in\ntheir particular pursuits so that they may come to the highest perfection sooner\nor later. The first business of a transcendentalist is to keep the mind always\non K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. One should always think of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and not forget Him even for a moment.\nConcentration of the mind on the Supreme is called sam\u0101dhi or trance. In order\nto concentrate the mind, one should always remain in seclusion and avoid\ndisturbance by external objects. He should be very careful to accept favorable\nand reject unfavorable conditions that affect his realization. And, in perfect\ndetermination, he should not hanker after unnecessary material things that\nentangle him by feelings of possessiveness.  All these perfections and precautions are perfectly executed when one is\ndirectly in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness because direct K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness means\nself-abnegation, wherein there is very little chance for material\npossessiveness. \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b characterizes K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness in this\nway:  an\u0101saktasya vi\u1e63ay\u0101n yath\u0101rham upayu\u00f1jata\u1e25 nirbandha\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-sambandhe yukta\u1e41\nvair\u0101gyam ucyate pr\u0101pa\u00f1cikatay\u0101 buddhy\u0101 hari-sambandhi-vastuna\u1e25 mumuk\u1e63ubhi\u1e25\nparity\u0101go vair\u0101gya\u1e41 phalgu kathyate.  (Bhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu 2.255\u2013256)  \u201cWhen one is not attached to anything, but at the same time accepts everything\nin relation to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one is rightly situated above possessiveness.

As such, he has no\nhankering for anything on his own personal account. He knows how to accept\nthings in favor of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and how to reject things unfavorable to\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. He is always aloof from material things because he is\nalways transcendental, and he is always alone, having nothing to do with persons\nnot in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.

K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47\u0101 is the ultimate goal of life, and the Vi\u1e63\u1e47u-murti situated in\none\u2019s heart is the object of yoga practice. To realize this Vi\u1e63\u1e47u-murti within\nthe heart, one has to observe complete abstinence from sex life; therefore one\nhas to leave home and live alone in a secluded place, remaining seated as\nmentioned above. One cannot enjoy sex life daily at home or elsewhere and attend\na so-called yoga class and thus become a yog\u012b. One has to practice controlling\nthe mind and avoiding all kinds of sense gratification, of which sex life is the\nchief. In the rules of celibacy written by the great sage Y\u0101j\u00f1avalkya it is\nsaid:  karma\u1e47\u0101 manas\u0101 v\u0101c\u0101 sarv\u0101vasth\u0101su sarvad\u0101 sarvatra maithu\u1e47a-ty\u0101go brahmacarya\u1e41\npracak\u1e63ate.  \u201cThe vow of brahmacarya is meant to help one completely abstain from sex\nindulgence in work, words and mind\u2014at all times, under all circumstances, and in\nall places.\u201d No one can perform correct yoga practice through sex indulgence.\nBrahmacarya is taught, therefore, from childhood when one has no knowledge of\nsex life. Children at the age of five are sent to the guru-kula, or the place of\nthe spiritual master, and the master trains the young boys in the strict\ndiscipline of becoming brahmac\u0101r\u012bs. Without such practice, no one can make\nadvancement in any yoga, whether it be dhy\u0101na, j\u00f1\u0101na or bhakti. One who,\nhowever, follows the rules and regulations of married life, having sexual\nrelationship only with his wife (and that also under regulation), is also called\nbrahmac\u0101r\u012b. Such a restrained householder brahmac\u0101r\u012b may be accepted in the\nbhakti school, but the j\u00f1\u0101na and dhy\u0101na schools do not admit even householder\nbrahmac\u0101r\u012bs. They require complete abstinence without compromise. In the bhakti\nschool, a householder brahmac\u0101r\u012b is allowed controlled sex life because the cult\nof bhakti-yoga is so powerful that one automatically loses sexual attraction,\nbeing engaged in the superior service of the Lord. In the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 it is\nsaid:  vi\u1e63ay\u0101 vinivartante nir\u0101h\u0101rasya dehina\u1e25 rasa-varja\u1e41 raso \u2019py asya para\u1e41 d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dv\u0101\nnivartate  Whereas others are forced to restrain themselves from sense gratification, a\ndevotee of the Lord automatically refrains because of superior taste. Other than\nthe devotee, no one has any information of that superior taste.  Vigatabh\u012b\u1e25. One cannot be fearless unless one is fully in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. A\nconditioned soul is fearful due to his perverted memory, his forgetfulness of\nhis eternal relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The Bh\u0101gavatam says, bhaya\u1e41\ndvit\u012by\u0101bhinive\u015bata\u1e25 sy\u0101d \u012b\u015b\u0101d apetasya viparyayo \u2018sm\u1e5bti\u1e25: K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is\nthe only basis for fearlessness. Therefore, perfect practice is possible for a\nperson who is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious. And since the ultimate goal of yoga practice is\nto see the Lord within, a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person is already the best of all\nyog\u012bs. The principles of the yoga system mentioned herein are different from\nthose of the popular so-called yoga societies.",

PURPORT  The ultimate goal in practicing yoga is now clearly explained. Yoga practice is\nnot meant for attaining any kind of material facility; it is to enable the\ncessation of all material existence. One who seeks an improvement in health or\naspires after material perfection is no yog\u012b according to Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Nor\ndoes cessation of material existence entail one\u2019s entering into \u201cthe void,\u201d\nwhich is only a myth. There is no void anywhere within the creation of the Lord.\nRather, the cessation of material existence enables one to enter into the\nspiritual sky, the abode of the Lord. The abode of the Lord is also clearly\ndescribed in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 as that place where there is no need of sun,\nmoon, nor electricity. All the planets in the spiritual kingdom are\nself-illuminated like the sun in the material sky. The kingdom of God is\neverywhere, but the spiritual sky and the planets thereof are called para\u1e41\ndh\u0101ma, or superior abodes.  A consummate yog\u012b, who is perfect in understanding Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, as is clearly\nstated herein (mat-citta\u1e25, mat-para\u1e25, mat-sth\u0101nam) by the Lord Himself, can\nattain real peace and can ultimately reach His supreme abode, the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-loka\nknown as Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. In the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 it is clearly stated (goloka\neva nivasaty akhil\u0101tma-bh\u016bta\u1e25) that the Lord, although residing always in His\nabode called Goloka, is the all-pervading Brahman and the localized Param\u0101tm\u0101 as\nwell by dint of His superior spiritual energies. No one can reach the spiritual\nsky or enter into the eternal abode (Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana) of the Lord\nwithout the proper understanding of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and His plenary expansion Vi\u1e63\u1e47u.\nTherefore a person working in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is the perfect yog\u012b, because\nhis mind is always absorbed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s activities.

TRANSLATION  There is no possibility of one\u2019s becoming a yog\u012b, O Arjuna, if one eats too\nmuch, or eats too little, sleeps too much or does not sleep enough.  PURPORT  Regulation of diet and sleep is recommended herein for the yog\u012bs. Too much\neating means eating more than is required to keep the body and soul together.\nThere is no need for men to eat animals because there is an ample supply of\ngrains, vegetables, fruits and milk. Such simple foodstuff is considered to be\nin the mode of goodness according to the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Animal food is for those\nin the mode of ignorance. Therefore, those who indulge in animal food, drinking,\nsmoking and eating food which is not first offered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a will suffer sinful\nreactions because of eating only polluted things. Bhu\u00f1jate te tv agha\u1e41 papa ye\npacanty \u0101tma-k\u0101ra\u1e47\u0101t. Anyone who eats for sense pleasure, or cooks for himself,\nnot offering his food to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, eats only sin. One who eats sin and eats more\nthan is allotted to him cannot execute perfect yoga. It is best that one eat\nonly the remnants of foodstuff offered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. A person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness\ndoes not eat anything which is not first offered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore, only the\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person can attain perfection in yoga practice. Nor can one who\nartificially abstains from eating, manufacturing his own personal process of\nfasting, practice yoga. The K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person observes fasting as it is\nrecommended in the scriptures. He does not fast or eat more than is required,\nand he is thus competent to perform yoga practice. One who eats more than\nrequired will dream very much while sleeping, and he must consequently sleep\nmore than is required. One should not sleep more than six hours daily. One who\nsleeps more than six hours out of twenty-four is certainly influenced by the\nmode of ignorance. A person in the mode of ignorance is lazy and prone to sleep\na great deal. Such a person cannot perform yoga.",

PURPORT  Extravagance in the matter of eating, sleeping, defending and mating\u2014which are\ndemands of the body\u2014can block advancement in the practice of yoga. As far as\neating is concerned, it can be regulated only when one is practiced to take and\naccept pras\u0101dam, sanctified food. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is offered, according to the\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (### . 9.26), vegetables, flowers, fruits, grains, milk, etc. In\nthis way, a person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness becomes automatically trained not to\naccept food not meant for human consumption, or which is not in the category of\ngoodness. As far as sleeping is concerned, a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person is always\nalert in the discharge of his duties in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, and therefore any\nunnecessary time spent sleeping is considered a great loss. A K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious\nperson cannot bear to pass a minute of his life without being engaged in the\nservice of the Lord. Therefore, his sleeping is kept to a minimum. His ideal in\nthis respect is \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b, who was always engaged in the service of\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and who could not sleep more than two hours a day, and sometimes not even\nthat. \u1e6ch\u0101kura Harid\u0101sa would not even accept pras\u0101dam nor even sleep for a\nmoment without finishing his daily routine of chanting with his beads three\nhundred thousand names. As far as work is concerned, a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person\ndoes not do anything which is not connected with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s interest, and thus his\nwork is always regulated and is untainted by sense gratification. Since there is\nno question of sense gratification, there is no material leisure for a person in\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. And because he is regulated in all his work, speech, sleep,\nwakefulness and all other bodily activities, there is no material misery for\nhim.",

TRANSLATION  The stage of perfection is called trance, or sam\u0101dhi, when one\u2019s mind is\ncompletely restrained from material mental activities by practice of yoga. This\nis characterized by one\u2019s ability to see the self by the pure mind and to relish\nand rejoice in the self. In that joyous state, one is situated in boundless\ntranscendental happiness and enjoys himself through transcendental senses.\nEstablished thus, one never departs from the truth, and upon gaining this he\nthinks there is no greater gain. Being situated in such a position, one is never\nshaken, even in the midst of greatest difficulty. This indeed is actual freedom\nfrom all miseries arising from material contact.  PURPORT  By practice of yoga one becomes gradually detached from material concepts. This\nis the primary characteristic of the yoga principle. And after this, one becomes\nsituated in trance, or sam\u0101dhi which means that the yog\u012b realizes the Supersoul\nthrough transcendental mind and intelligence, without any of the misgivings of\nidentifying the self with the Superself. Yoga practice is more or less based on\nthe principles of the Pata\u00f1jali system. Some unauthorized commentators try to\nidentify the individual soul with the Supersoul, and the monists think this to\nbe liberation, but they do not understand the real purpose of the Pata\u00f1jali\nsystem of yoga. There is an acceptance of transcendental pleasure in the\nPata\u00f1jali system, but the monists do not accept this transcendental pleasure out\nof fear of jeopardizing the theory of oneness. The duality of knowledge and\nknower is not accepted by the nondualist, but in this verse transcendental\npleasure\u2014realized through transcendental senses\u2014is accepted. And this is\ncorroborated by the Pata\u00f1jali Muni, the famous exponent of the yoga system. The\ngreat sage declares in his Yoga-s\u016btras: puru\u1e63\u0101rtha-\u015b\u016bny\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 gu\u1e47\u0101n\u0101\u1e41\npratiprasava\u1e25 kaivalya\u1e41 svar\u016bpa-prati\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101 v\u0101 citi-\u015baktir iti.  This citi-\u015bakti, or internal potency, is transcendental. Puru\u1e63\u0101rtha means\nmaterial religiosity, economic development, sense gratification and, at the end,\nthe attempt to become one with the Supreme. This \u201coneness with the Supreme\u201d is\ncalled kaivalyam by the monist. But according to Pata\u00f1jali, this kaivalyam is an\ninternal, or transcendental, potency by which the living entity becomes aware of\nhis constitutional position. In the words of Lord Caitanya, this state of\naffairs is called ceto-darpa\u1e47a-m\u0101rjanam, or clearance of the impure mirror of\nthe mind. This \u201cclearance\u201d is actually liberation, or\nbhava-mah\u0101d\u0101v\u0101gni-nirv\u0101pa\u1e47am. The theory of nirv\u0101\u1e47a\u2014also preliminary\u2014corresponds\nwith this principle. In the Bh\u0101gavatam this is called svar\u016bpe\u1e47a vyavasthiti\u1e25.\nThe Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 also confirms this situation in this verse.  After nirv\u0101\u1e47a, or material cessation, there is the manifestation of spiritual\nactivities, or devotional service of the Lord, known as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. In\nthe words of the Bh\u0101gavatam, svar\u016bpe\u1e47a vyavasthiti\u1e25: this is the \u201creal life of\nthe living entity.\u201d M\u0101y\u0101, or illusion, is the condition of spiritual life\ncontaminated by material infection. Liberation from this material infection does\nnot mean destruction of the original eternal position of the living entity.\nPata\u00f1jali also accepts this by his words kaivalyam svar\u016bpa-prati\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101 v\u0101\nciti-\u015baktir iti. This citi-\u015bakti or transcendental pleasure, is real life. This\nis confirmed in the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btras as \u0101nandamayo \u2019bhy\u0101s\u0101t. This natural\ntranscendental pleasure is the ultimate goal of yoga and is easily achieved by\nexecution of devotional service, or bhakti-yoga. Bhaktiyoga will be vividly\ndescribed in the Seventh Chapter of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.  In the yoga system, as described in this chapter, there are two kinds of\nsam\u0101dhi, called sampraj\u00f1\u0101ta-sam\u0101dhi and asampraj\u00f1\u0101ta-sam\u0101dhi. When one becomes\nsituated in the transcendental position by various philosophical researches, it\nis called sampraj\u00f1\u0101ta-sam\u0101dhi. In the asampraj\u00f1\u0101ta-sam\u0101dhi there is no longer\nany connection with mundane pleasure, for one is then transcendental to all\nsorts of happiness derived from the senses. When the yog\u012b is once situated in\nthat transcendental position, he is never shaken from it. Unless the yog\u012b is\nable to reach this position, he is unsuccessful. Today\u2019s so-called yoga\npractice, which involves various sense pleasures, is contradictory. A yog\u012b\nindulging in sex and intoxication is a mockery. Even those yog\u012bs who are\nattracted by the siddhis (perfections) in the process of yoga are not perfectly\nsituated. If the yog\u012bs are attracted by the by-products of yoga, then they\ncannot attain the stage of perfection, as is stated in this verse. Persons,\ntherefore, indulging in the make-show practice of gymnastic feats or siddhis\nshould know that the aim of yoga is lost in that way.  The best practice of yoga in this age is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, which is not\nbaffling. A K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person is so happy in his occupation that he does\nnot aspire after any other happiness. There are many impediments, especially in\nthis age of hypocrisy, to practicing ha\u1e6dha-yoga, dhy\u0101na-yoga, and j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga,\nbut there is no such problem in executing karma-yoga or bhakti-yoga.  As long as the material body exists, one has to meet the demands of the body,\nnamely eating, sleeping, defending and mating. But a person who is in pure\nbhakti-yoga or in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness does not arouse the senses while meeting\nthe demands of the body. Rather, he accepts the bare necessities of life, making\nthe best use of a bad bargain, and enjoys transcendental happiness in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness. He is callous toward incidental occurrences\u2014such as accidents,\ndisease, scarcity and even the death of a most dear relative\u2014but he is always\nalert to execute his duties in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness or bhakti-yoga. Accidents\nnever deviate him from his duty. As stated in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, \u0101gam\u0101p\u0101yino\n\u2019nity\u0101s t\u0101\u1e41s titik\u1e63asva bh\u0101rata. He endures all such incidental occurences\nbecause he knows that they come and go and do not affect his duties. In this way\nhe achieves the highest perfection in yoga practice.",

TRANSLATION  One should engage oneself in the practice of yoga with undeviating determination\nand faith. One should abandon, without exception, all material desires born of\nfalse ego and thus control all the senses on all sides by the mind.  PURPORT  The yoga practitioner should be determined and should patiently prosecute the\npractice without deviation. One should be sure of success at the end and pursue\nthis course with great perserverance, not becoming discouraged if there is any\ndelay in the attainment of success. Success is sure for the rigid practitioner.\nRegarding bhakti-yoga, Rupa Gosv\u0101m\u012b says:  uts\u0101h\u0101n ni\u015bcay\u0101d dhairy\u0101t tat tat karma-pravartan\u0101t sa\u1e45ga-ty\u0101g\u0101t satov\u1e5btte\u1e25\n\u1e63a\u1e0dbhir bhakti\u1e25 prasidhyati  \u201cThe process of bhakti-yoga can be executed successfully with full-hearted\nenthusiasm, perseverance, and determination by following the prescribed duties\nin the association of devotees and by engaging completely in activities of\ngoodness.\u201d  As for determination, one should follow the example of the sparrow who lost her\neggs in the waves of the ocean. A sparrow laid her eggs on the shore of the\nocean, but the big ocean carried away the eggs on its waves. The sparrow became\nvery upset and asked the ocean to return her eggs. The ocean did not even\nconsider her appeal. So the sparrow decided to dry up the ocean. She began to\npick out the water in her small beak, and everyone laughed at her for her\nimpossible determination. The news of her activity spread, and at last Garu\u1e0da,\nthe gigantic bird carrier of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, heard it. He became compassionate\ntoward his small sister bird, and so he came to see the sparrow. Garu\u1e0da was very\npleased by the determination of the small sparrow, and he promised to help. Thus\nGaru\u1e0da at once asked the ocean to return her eggs lest he himself take up the\nwork of the sparrow. The ocean was frightened at this, and returned the eggs.\nThus the sparrow became happy by the grace of Garu\u1e0da.  Similarly, the practice of yoga, especially bhakti-yoga in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness,\nmay appear to be a very difficult job. But if anyone follows the principles with\ngreat determination, the Lord will surely help, for God helps those who help\nthemselves.",

In the sm\u1e5bti this is confirmed as follows: \u0101tatatv\u0101c\nca m\u0101t\u1e5btv\u0101d \u0101tm\u0101 hi paramo hari\u1e25.  The Lord, being the source of all beings, is like the mother and the maintainer.\nAs the mother is neutral to all different kinds of children, the Supreme Father\n(or Mother) is also. Consequently the Supersoul is always in every living being.\nOutwardly, also, every living being is situated in the energy of the Lord. As\nwill be explained in the Seventh Chapter, the Lord has, primarily, two\nenergies\u2014the spiritual (or superior) and the material (or inferior). The living\nentity, although part of the superior energy, is conditioned by the inferior\nenergy; the living entity is always in the Lord\u2019s energy. Every living entity is\nsituated in Him in one way or another. The yog\u012b sees equally because he sees\nthat all living entities, although in different situations according to the\nresults of fruitive work, in all circumstances remain the servants of God. While\nin the material energy, the living entity serves the material senses; and while\nin spiritual energy, he serves the Supreme Lord directly. In either case the\nliving entity is the servant of God. This vision of equality is perfect in a\nperson in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.",

Such a person may appear to see all separate\nmanifestations of the material nature, but in each and every instance he is\nconscious of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, knowing that everything is the manifestation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s\nenergy. Nothing can exist without K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Lord of\neverything\u2014this is the basic principle of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.  K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is the development of love of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2014a position\ntranscendental even to material liberation. It is the stage beyond\nself-realization at which the devotee becomes one with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in the sense that\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a becomes everything for the devotee, and the devotee becomes full in loving\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. An intimate relationship between the Lord and the devotee then exists. In\nthat stage, the living entity attains his immortality. Nor is the Personality of\nGodhead ever out of the sight of the devotee. To merge in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is spiritual\nannihilation. A devotee takes no such risk. It is stated in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101:  prem\u0101\u00f1jana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena santa\u1e25 sadaiva h\u1e5bdaye\u1e63u vilokayanti ya\u1e41\n\u015by\u0101masundaram acintya-gu\u1e47a-svar\u016bpa\u1e41 govindam \u0101di-puru\u1e63a\u1e41 tam aha\u1e41 bhaj\u0101mi  \u201cI worship the primeval Lord, Govinda, who is always seen by the devotee whose\neyes are anointed with the pulp of love. He is seen in His eternal form of\n\u015ay\u0101masundara situated within the heart of the devotee.\" (Bs. 5.38)  At this stage, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a never disappears from the sight of the devotee, nor\ndoes the devotee ever lose sight of the Lord. In the case of a yog\u012b who sees the\nLord as Param\u0101tm\u0101 within the heart, the same applies. Such a yog\u012b turns into a\npure devotee and cannot bear to live for a moment with out seeing the Lord\nwithin himself.",

K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in this form of Supersoul is situated in everyone\u2019s heart.\nFurthermore, there is no difference between the innumerable Supersouls present\nin the innumerable hearts of living entities.

K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the proprietor of all lands and planets.\nThe perfect yog\u012b is the sincerest friend of all living entities.

It is not possible for an ordinary man to leave\nhome and go to a secluded place in the mountains or jungles to practice yoga in\nthis age of Kali. The present age is characterized by a bitter struggle for a\nlife of short duration. People are not serious about self-realization even by\nsimple, practical means, and what to speak of this difficult yoga system, which\nregulates the mode of living, the manner of sitting, selection of place, and\ndetachment of the mind from material engagements. As a practical man, Arjuna\nthought it was impossible to follow this system of yoga, even though he was\nfavorably endowed in many ways. He belonged to the royal family and was highly\nelevated in terms of numerous qualities; he was a great warrior, he had great\nlongevity, and, above all, he was the most intimate friend of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead. Five thousand years ago, Arjuna had much better\nfacilities then we do now, yet he refused to accept this system of yoga. In\nfact, we do not find any record in history of his practicing it at any time.\nTherefore this system must be considered generally impossible in this age of\nKali. Of course it may be possible for some very few, rare men, but for the\npeople in general it is an impossible proposal. If this were so five thousand\nyears ago, then what of the present day? Those who are imitating this yoga\nsystem in different so-called schools and societies, although complacent, are\ncertainly wasting their time.

PURPORT  The mind is so strong and obstinate that it sometimes overcomes the\nintelligence, although mind is supposed to be subservient to the intelligence.\nFor a man in the practical world who has to fight so many opposing elements, it\nis certainly very difficult to control the mind. Artificially, one may establish\na mental equilibrium toward both friend and enemy, but ultimately no worldly man\ncan do so, for this is more difficult than controlling the raging wind.

Such a strong mind is supposed to\nbe controlled by the practice of yoga, but such practice is never practical for\na worldly person like Arjuna. And what can we say of modern man? The simile used\nhere is appropriate: one cannot capture the blowing wind. And it is even more\ndifficult to capture the turbulent mind.

PURPORT  The difficulty of controlling the obstinate mind, as expressed by Arjuna, is\naccepted by the Personality of Godhead. But at the same time He suggests that by\npractice and detachment it is possible. What is that practice? In the present\nage no one can observe strict rules and regulations, such as placing oneself in\na sacred place, focusing the mind on the Supersoul, restraining the senses and\nmind, observing celibacy, remaining alone, etc. By the practice of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness, however, one engages in nine types of devotional service to the\nLord. The first and foremost of such devotional engagements is hearing about\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This is a very powerful transcendental method for purging the mind of all\nmisgivings. The more one hears about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the more one becomes enlightened and\ndetached from everything that draws the mind away from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. By detaching the\nmind from activities not devoted to the Lord, one can very easily learn\nvair\u0101gya. Vair\u0101gya means detachment from matter and engagement of the mind in\nspirit. Impersonal spiritual detachment is more difficult than attaching the\nmind to the activities of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This is practical because by hearing about\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a one becomes automatically attached to the Supreme Spirit. This attachment\nis called pare\u015b\u0101nubh\u016bti spiritual satisfaction. It is just like the feeling of\nsatisfaction a hungry man has for every morsel of food he eats. Similarly, by\ndischarge of devotional service, one feels transcendental satisfaction as the\nmind becomes detached from material objectives. It is something like curing a\ndisease by expert treatment and appropriate diet. Hearing of the transcendental\nactivities of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is therefore expert treatment for the mad mind, and\neating the foodstuff offered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the appropriate diet for the suffering\npatient. This treatment is the process of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.",

Trying to practice yoga while engaging the mind in\nmaterial enjoyment is like trying to ignite a fire while pouring water on it.\nSimilarly, yoga practice without mental control is a waste of time. Such a show\nof yoga practice may be materially lucrative, but it is useless as far as\nspiritual realization is concerned. Therefore, the mind must be controlled by\nengaging it constantly in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. Unless\none is engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, he cannot steadily control the mind. A\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person easily achieves the result of yoga practice without\nseparate endeavor, but a yoga practitioner cannot achieve success without\nbecoming K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious.",

TRANSLATION  Arjuna said: What is the destination of the man of faith who does not persevere,\nwho in the beginning takes to the process of self-realization but who later\ndesists due to worldly-mindedness and thus does not attain perfection in\nmysticism?  PURPORT  The path of self-realization or mysticism is described in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. The\nbasic principle of self-realization is knowledge that the living entity is not\nthis material body but that he is different from it and that his happiness is in\neternal life, bliss and knowledge. These are transcendental, beyond both body\nand mind. Self-realization is sought by the path of knowledge, the practice of\nthe eightfold system or by bhakti-yoga. In each of these processes one has to\nrealize the constitutional position of the living entity, his relationship with\nGod, and the activities whereby he can reestablish the lost link and achieve the\nhighest perfectional stage of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Following any of the\nabove-mentioned three methods, one is sure to reach the supreme goal sooner or\nlater. This was asserted by the Lord in the Second Chapter: even a little\nendeavor on the transcendental path offers a great hope for deliverance. Out of\nthese three methods, the path of bhakti-yoga is especially suitable for this age\nbecause it is the most direct method of God realization. To be doubly assured,\nArjuna is asking Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to confirm His former statement. One may sincerely\naccept the path of self-realization, but the process of cultivation of knowledge\nand the practice of the eightfold yoga system are generally very difficult for\nthis age. Therefore, despite constant endeavor, one may fail for many reasons.\nFirst of all, one may not be following the process. To pursue the transcendental\npath is more or less to declare war on illusory energy. Consequently, whenever a\nperson tries to escape the clutches of the illusory energy, she tries to defeat\nthe practitioner by various allurements. A conditioned soul is already allured\nby the modes of material energy, and there is every chance of being allured\nagain, even while performing transcendental disciplines. This is called yog\u0101t\ncalita-m\u0101nasa\u1e25: deviation from the transcendental path. Arjuna is inquisitive to\nknow the results of deviation from the path of self-realization.",

Those who are materialists have no interest in\nTranscendence; therefore they are more interested in material advancement by\neconomic development, or in promotion to the higher planets by appropriate work.\nWhen one takes to the path of Transcendence, one has to cease all material\nactivities and sacrifice all forms of so-called material happiness.

He has no\nposition; he is like a riven cloud. A cloud in the sky sometimes deviates from a\nsmall cloud and joins a big one. But if it cannot join a big one, then it is\nblown away by the wind and becomes a nonentity in the vast sky. The brahma\u1e47a\u1e25\npathi is the path of transcendental realization through knowing oneself to be\nspiritual in essence, part and parcel of the Supreme Lord who is manifested as\nBrahman, Param\u0101tm\u0101 and Bhagav\u0101n. Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the fullest manifestation of\nthe Supreme Absolute Truth, and therefore one who is surrendered to the Supreme\nPerson is a successful transcendentalist.

PURPORT  In the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (1.5.17) \u015ar\u012b N\u0101rada Muni instructs Vy\u0101sadeva as\nfollows:  tyaktv\u0101 sva-dharma\u1e41 cara\u1e47\u0101mbuja\u1e41 harer bhajann apakko \u2019tha patet tato yadi yatra\nkva v\u0101bhadram abh\u016bd amu\u1e63ya ki\u1e41 ko v\u0101rtha \u0101pto \u2019bhajat\u0101\u1e41 sva-dharmata\u1e25  \u201cIf someone gives up all material prospects and takes complete shelter of the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead, there is no loss or degradation in any way. On\nthe other hand a nondevotee may fully engage in his occupational duties and yet\nnot gain anything.\u201d For material prospects, there are many activities both\nscriptural and customary. A transcendentalist is supposed to give up all\nmaterial activities for the sake of spiritual advancement in life, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness. One may argue that by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness one may attain the\nhighest perfection if it is completed, but if one does not attain such a\nperfectional stage, then he loses both materially and spiritually. It is\nenjoined in the scriptures that one has to suffer the reaction of not executing\nprescribed duties; therefore one who fails to discharge transcendental\nactivities properly becomes subjected to these reactions. The Bh\u0101gavatam assures\nthe unsuccessful transcendentalist that there need be no worries. Even though he\nmay be subjected to the reaction of not perfectly executing prescribed duties,\nhe is still not a loser, because auspicious K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is never\nforgotten, and one so engaged will continue to be so even if he is lowborn in\nthe next life. On the other hand, one who simply follows strictly the prescribed\nduties need not necessarily attain auspicious results if he is lacking in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness.  The purport may be understood as follows: humanity may be divided into two\nsections, namely, the regulated and the nonregulated. Those who are engaged\nsimply in bestial sense gratifications without knowledge of their next life or\nspiritual salvation belong to the nonregulated section. And those who follow the\nprinciples of prescribed duties in the scriptures are classified amongst the\nregulated section. The nonregulated section, both civilized and noncivilized,\neducated and noneducated, strong and weak, are full of animal propensities.\nTheir activities are never auspicious because, enjoying the animal propensities\nof eating, sleeping, defending and mating, they perpetually remain in material\nexistence, which is always miserable. On the other hand, those who are regulated\nby scriptural injunctions and thus gradually rise to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness\ncertainly progress in life.  Those who are then following the path of auspiciousness can be divided into\nthree sections, namely, 1) the followers of scriptural rules and regulations who\nare enjoying material prosperity, 2) those who are trying to find out the\nultimate liberation from material existence, and 3) those who are devotees in\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Those who are following the rules and regulations of the\nscriptures for material happiness may be further divided into two classes: those\nwho are fruitive workers and those who desire no fruit for sense gratification.\nThose who are after fruitive results for sense gratification may be elevated to\na higher standard of life\u2014even to the higher planets; but still, because they\nare not free from material existence, they are not following the truly\nauspicious path. The only auspicious activities are those which lead one to\nliberation. Any activity which is not aimed at ultimate self-realization or\nliberation from the material bodily concept of life is not at all auspicious.\nActivity in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is the only auspicious activity, and anyone who\nvoluntarily accepts all bodily discomforts for the sake of making progress on\nthe path of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness can be called a perfect transcendentalist under\nsevere austerity. And because the eightfold yoga system is directed toward the\nultimate realization of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, such practice is also auspicious,\nand no one who is trying his best in this matter need fear degradation.",

Although \u1e6ch\u0101kur Harid\u0101sa\nhappened to take his birth in a Moslem family, he was elevated to the post of\nn\u0101m\u0101c\u0101rya by Lord Caitanya due to his rigidly attended principle of chanting\nthree hundred thousand holy names of the Lord daily: Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a,\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare. And because\nhe chanted the holy name of the Lord constantly, it is understood that in his\nprevious life he must have passed through all the ritualistic methods of the\nVedas, known as \u015babda-brahman. Unless, therefore, one is purified, one cannot\ntake to the principle of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness nor become engaged in chanting the\nholy name of the Lord, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",

PURPORT  When we speak of yoga we refer to linking up our consciousness with the Supreme\nAbsolute Truth. Such a process is named differently by various practitioners in\nterms of the particular method adopted. When the linking up process is\npredominantly in fruitive activities, it is called karma-yoga, when it is\npredominantly empirical, it is called j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga, and when it is predominantly\nin a devotional relationship with the Supreme Lord, it is called bhakti-yoga.\nBhakti-yoga or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is the ultimate perfection of all yogas, as\nwill be explained in the next verse. The Lord has confirmed herein the\nsuperiority of yoga, but He has not mentioned that it is better than\nbhakti-yoga. Bhakti-yoga is full spiritual knowledge, and as such, nothing can\nexcel it. Asceticism without self-knowledge is imperfect. Empiric knowledge\nwithout surrender to the Supreme Lord is also imperfect. And fruitive work\nwithout K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is a waste of time. Therefore, the most highly\npraised form of yoga performance mentioned here is bhakti-yoga, and this is\nstill more clearly explained in the next verse.",

TRANSLATION  And of all yog\u012bs, he who always abides in Me with great faith, worshiping Me in\ntranscendental loving service, is most intimately united with Me in yoga and is\nthe highest of all.  PURPORT  The word bhajete is significant here. Bhajete has its root in the verb bhaj,\nwhich is used when there is need of service. The English word \u201cworship\u201d cannot\nbe used in the same sense as bhaja. Worship means to adore, or to show respect\nand honor to the worthy one. But service with love and faith is especially meant\nfor the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One can avoid worshiping a respectable\nman or a demigod and may be called discourteous, but one cannot avoid serving\nthe Supreme Lord without being thoroughly condemned. Every living entity is part\nand parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and thus every living entity\nis intended to serve the Supreme Lord by his own constitution. Failing to do\nthis, he falls down. The Bh\u0101gavatam confirms this as follows:  ya e\u1e63\u0101\u1e41 puru\u1e63a\u1e41 s\u0101k\u1e63\u0101d \u0101tma-prabhavam \u012b\u015bvaram na bhajanty avaj\u0101nanti sth\u0101n\u0101d\nbhra\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101 patanty adha\u1e25.  \u201cAnyone who does not render service and neglects his duty unto the Primeval\nLord, who is the source of all living entities, will certainly fall down from\nhis constitutional position.\u201d  In this verse also the word bhajanti is used. Therefore, bhajanti is applicable\nto the Supreme Lord only, whereas the word \u201cworship\u201d can be applied to demigods\nor to any other common living entity. The word avaj\u0101nanti, used in this verse of\n\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, is also found in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101: avaj\u0101nanti m\u0101\u1e41 m\u016b\u1e0dh\u0101\u1e25:\n\u201cOnly the fools and rascals deride the Supreme Personality of Godhead Lord\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u201d Such fools take it upon themselves to write commentaries on the\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 without an attitude of service to the Lord. Consequently they\ncannot properly distinguish between the word bhajanti and the word \u201cworship.\u201d  The culmination of all kinds of yoga practices lies in bhakti-yoga. All other\nyogas are but means to come to the point of bhakti in bhakti-yoga. Yoga actually\nmeans bhakti-yoga; all other yogas are progressions toward the destination of\nbhakti-yoga. From the beginning of karma-yoga to the end of bhakti-yoga is a\nlong way to self-realization. Karma-yoga, without fruitive results, is the\nbeginning of this path. When karma-yoga increases in knowledge and renunciation,\nthe stage is called j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga. When j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga increases in meditation on the\nSupersoul by different physical processes, and the mind is on Him, it is called\na\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45ga-yoga. And, when one surpasses the a\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45ga-yoga and comes to the point of\nthe Supreme Personality of Godhead K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, it is called bhakti-yoga, the\nculmination. Factually, bhakti-yoga is the ultimate goal, but to analyze\nbhakti-yoga minutely one has to understand these other yogas. The yog\u012b who is\nprogressive is therefore on the true path of eternal good fortune. One who\nsticks to a particular point and does not make further progress is called by\nthat particular name: karma-yog\u012b, j\u00f1\u0101na-yog\u012b or dhy\u0101na-yog\u012b, r\u0101ja-yog\u012b,\nha\u1e6dha-yog\u012b, etc. If one is fortunate enough to come to the point of bhakti-yoga,\nit is to be understood that he has surpassed all the other yogas. Therefore, to\nbecome K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious is the highest stage of yoga, just as, when we speak of\nHimalayan, we refer to the world\u2019s highest mountains, of which the highest peak,\nMount Everest, is considered to be the culmination.  It is by great fortune that one comes to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness on the path of\nbhakti-yoga to become well situated according to the Vedic direction. The ideal\nyog\u012b concentrates his attention on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who is called \u015ay\u0101masundara, who is as\nbeautifully colored as a cloud, whose lotus-like face is as effulgent as the\nsun, whose dress is brilliant with jewels and whose body is flower garlanded.\nIlluminating all sides is His gorgeous luster, which is called the brahmajyoti.\nHe incarnates in different forms such as R\u0101ma, N\u1e5bsi\u1e41ha, Var\u0101ha and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead, and He descends like a human being, as the son\nof Mother Ya\u015bod\u0101, and He is known as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Govinda and V\u0101sudeva. He is the\nperfect child, husband, friend and master, and He is full with all opulences and\ntranscendental qualities. If one remains fully conscious of these features of\nthe Lord, he is called the highest yog\u012b.  This stage of highest perfection in yoga can be attained only by bhakti-yoga, as\nis confirmed in all Vedic literature:  yasya deve par\u0101 bhaktir yath\u0101 deve tath\u0101 gurau.  tasyaite kathit\u0101 hy arth\u0101\u1e25\nprak\u0101\u015bante mah\u0101tmana\u1e25.  \u201cOnly unto those great souls who have implicit faith in both the Lord and the\nspiritual master are all the imports of Vedic knowledge automatically revealed.\u201d  Bhaktir asya bhajana\u1e41 tadih\u0101mutrop\u0101dhi nair\u0101syen\u0101mu\u1e63min mana\u1e25 kalpanam; etad eva\nnai\u1e63karmyam. \u201cBhakti means devotional service to the Lord which is free from\ndesire for material profit, either in this life or in the next. Devoid of such\ninclinations, one should fully absorb the mind in the Supreme. That is the\npurpose of nai\u1e63karmya.\u201d  These are some of the means for performance of bhakti or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness,\nthe highest perfectional stage of the yoga system.",

K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is full in all opulences, and how He manifests such\nopulences is described herein. Also, four kinds of fortunate people who become\nattached to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and four kinds of unfortunate people who never take to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nare described in this chapter.\n\n\nIn the first six chapters of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, the living entity has been described\nas nonmaterial spirit soul which is capable of elevating himself to\nself-realization by different types of yogas. At the end of the Sixth Chapter,\nit has been clearly stated that the steady concentration of the mind upon K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a,\nor in other words K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, is the highest form of all yoga. By\nconcentrating one\u2019s mind upon K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one is able to know the Absolute Truth\ncompletely, but not otherwise. Impersonal brahmajyoti or localized Param\u0101tm\u0101\nrealization is not perfect knowledge of the Absolute Truth because it is\npartial. Full and scientific knowledge is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and everything is revealed to\nthe person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. In complete K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness one knows\nthat K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is ultimate knowledge beyond any doubts. Different types of yoga are\nonly steppingstones on the path of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. One who takes directly\nto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness automatically knows about brahmajyoti and Param\u0101tm\u0101 in\nfull. By practice of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness yoga, one can know everything in\nfull\u2014namely the Absolute Truth, the living entities, the material nature, and\ntheir manifestations with paraphernalia.\n\n\nOne should therefore begin yoga practice as directed in the last verse of the\nSixth Chapter. Concentration of the mind upon K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a the Supreme is made possible\nby prescribed devotional service in nine different forms, of which \u015brava\u1e47am is\nthe first and most important. The Lord therefore says to Arjuna, \u201ctat \u015b\u1e5b\u1e47u,\u201d or\n\u201cHear from Me.\u201d No one can be a greater authority than K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and therefore by\nhearing from Him one receives the greatest opportunity for progress in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness. One has therefore to learn from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a directly or from a pure\ndevotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2014and not from a nondevotee upstart, puffed up with academic\neducation.\n\n\nIn the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam this process of understanding K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth, is described in the Second Chapter\nof the First Canto as follows:\n\n\n\u015b\u1e5b\u1e47vat\u0101\u1e41 sva-kath\u0101\u1e41 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u1e25 pu\u1e47ya-\u015brava\u1e47a-k\u012brtana\u1e25 h\u1e5bdyanta\u1e25stho hy abhadr\u0101\u1e47i\nvidbunoti suh\u1e5bt sat\u0101m.\n\n\nna\u1e63\u1e6da-pr\u0101ye\u1e63v abhadre\u1e63u nitya\u1e41 bh\u0101gavata-sevay\u0101 bhagavaty uttama-\u015bloke bhaktir\nbhavati nai\u1e63\u1e6dhik\u012b.\n\n\ntad\u0101 rajas-tamo-bh\u0101v\u0101\u1e25 k\u0101ma-lobhadaya\u015b ca ye ceta etair an\u0101viddha\u1e41 sthita\u1e41\nsattve pras\u012bdati.\n\n\nevam prasanna-manaso bhagavad-bhakti-yogata\u1e25 bhagavat-tattva-vij\u00f1\u0101na\u1e41\nmukta-sa\u1e45gasya j\u0101yate.\n\n\nbhidyate h\u1e5bdaya-granthi\u015b chidyante sarva-sa\u1e41\u015bay\u0101\u1e25 k\u1e63\u012byante c\u0101sya karm\u0101\u1e47i d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da\nev\u0101tman\u012b\u015bvare.\n\n\n\u201cTo hear about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a from Vedic literatures, or to hear from Him directly\nthrough the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, is itself righteous activity. And for one who hears\nabout K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who is dwelling in everyone\u2019s heart, acts as a\nbest-wishing friend and purifies the devotee who constantly engages in hearing\nof Him. In this way, a devotee naturally develops his dormant transcendental\nknowledge. As he hears more about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a from the Bh\u0101gavatam and from the\ndevotees, he becomes fixed in the devotional service of the Lord. By development\nof devotional service one becomes freed from the modes of passion and ignorance,\nand thus material lusts and avarice are diminished. When these impurities are\nwiped away, the candidate remains steady in his position of pure goodness,\nbecomes enlivened by devotional service and understands the science of God\nperfectly. Thus bhakti-yoga severs the hard knot of material affection and\nenables one to come at once to the stage of \u2018asa\u1e41\u015baya\u1e41 samagram,\u2019 understanding\nof the Supreme Absolute Truth Personality of Godhead.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 1.2.17\u201321)\n\n\nTherefore only by hearing from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or from His devotee in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness\ncan one understand the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\n\n\n7.2\n\n\nj\u00f1\u0101na\u1e41 te \u2019ha\u1e41 sa-vij\u00f1\u0101nam\n\n\nida\u1e41 vak\u1e63y\u0101my a\u015be\u1e63ata\u1e25\n\n\nyaj j\u00f1\u0101tv\u0101 neha bh\u016byo \u2019nyaj\n\n\nj\u00f1\u0101tavyam ava\u015bi\u1e63yate\n\n\nj\u00f1\u0101nam\u2014phenomenal knowledge; te\u2014unto you; aham\u2014I; sa\u2014with; vij\u00f1\u0101nam\u2014noumenal\nknowledge; idam\u2014this; vak\u1e63y\u0101mi\u2014shall explain; a\u015be\u1e63ata\u1e25\u2014in full; yat\u2014which;\nj\u00f1\u0101tv\u0101\u2014knowing; na\u2014not; iha\u2014in this world; bh\u016bya\u1e25\u2014further; anyat\u2014anything more;\nj\u00f1\u0101tavyam\u2014knowable; ava\u015bi\u1e63yate\u2014remains to be known.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nI shall now declare unto you in full this knowledge both phenomenal and\nnoumenal, by knowing which there shall remain nothing further to be known.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nComplete knowledge includes knowledge of the phenomenal world and the spirit\nbehind it.

In the beginning of the Fourth Chapter\nthis explanation was given by the Lord, and it is again confirmed here: complete\nknowledge can be achieved only by the devotee of the Lord directly from the Lord\nin disciplic succession. Therefore one should be intelligent enough to know the\nsource of all knowledge, who is the cause of all causes and the only object for\nmeditation in all types of yoga practices. When the cause of all causes becomes\nknown, then everything knowable becomes known, and nothing remains unknown.

Generally mankind is\nsimply engaged in the animal propensities, namely eating, sleeping, defending\nand mating, and hardly anyone is interested in transcendental knowledge. The\nfirst six chapters of the G\u012bt\u0101 are meant for those who are interested in\ntranscendental knowledge, in understanding the self, the Superself and the\nprocess of realization by j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga, dhy\u0101na-yoga, and discrimination of the\nself from matter. However, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can only be known by persons who are in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness. Other transcendentalists may achieve impersonal Brahman\nrealization, for this is easier than understanding K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme\nPerson, but at the same time He is beyond the knowledge of Brahman and\nParam\u0101tm\u0101. The yog\u012bs and j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs are confused in their attempts to understand\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, although the greatest of the impersonalists, \u015ar\u012bp\u0101da \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101c\u0101rya, has\nadmitted in his G\u012bt\u0101 commentary that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead. But his followers do not accept K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as such, for it is very difficult\nto know K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, even though one has transcendental realization of impersonal\nBrahman.\n\n\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the cause of all causes, the\nprimeval Lord Govinda. \u012a\u015bvara\u1e25 parama\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u1e25 sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha\u1e25 an\u0101dir\n\u0101dir govinda\u1e25 sarva-k\u0101ra\u1e47a-k\u0101ra\u1e47am. It is very difficult for the nondevotees to\nknow Him. Although nondevotees declare that the path of bhakti or devotional\nservice is very easy, they cannot practice it. If the path of bhakti is so easy,\nas the nondevotee class of men proclaim, then why do they take up the difficult\npath? Actually the path of bhakti is not easy. The so-called path of bhakti\npracticed by unauthorized persons without knowledge of bhakti may be easy, but\nwhen it is practiced factually according to the rules and regulations, the\nspeculative scholars and philosophers fall away from the path. \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa\nGosv\u0101m\u012b writes in his Bhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu:\n\n\n\u015bruti-sm\u1e5bti-pur\u0101\u1e47\u0101di-pa\u00f1car\u0101tra-vidhi\u1e41 vin\u0101 aik\u0101ntik\u012b harer bhaktir utp\u0101t\u0101yaiva\nkalpate.\n\n\n\u201cDevotional service of the Lord that ignores the authorized Vedic literatures\nlike the Upani\u1e63ads, Pur\u0101\u1e47as, N\u0101rada-pa\u00f1car\u0101tra, etc., is simply an unnecessary\ndisturbance in society.\u201d\n\n\nIt is not possible for the Brahman realized impersonalist or the Param\u0101tm\u0101\nrealized yog\u012b to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a the Supreme Personality of Godhead as the son\nof mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 or the charioteer of Arjuna. Even the great demigods are\nsometimes confused about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a: \u201cmuhyanti yat s\u016braya\u1e25,\u201d \u201cm\u0101\u1e41 tu veda na\nka\u015bcana.\u201d \u201cNo one knows Me as I am,\u201d the Lord says. And if one does know Him,\nthen \u201csa mah\u0101tm\u0101 sudurlabha\u1e25.\u201d \u201cSuch a great soul is very rare.\u201d Therefore\nunless one practices devotional service to the Lord, he cannot know K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as He\nis (tattvata\u1e25), even though one is a great scholar or philosopher. Only the pure\ndevotees can know something of the inconceivable transcendental qualities in\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, in the cause of all causes, in His omnipotence and opulence, and in His\nwealth, fame, strength, beauty, knowledge and renunciation, because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is\nbenevolently inclined to His devotees. He is the last word in Brahman\nrealization, and the devotees alone can realize Him as He is. Therefore it is\nsaid:\n\n\nata\u1e25 \u015br\u012b-k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-n\u0101m\u0101di na bhaved gr\u0101hyam indriy\u0101i\u1e25 sevonmukhe hi jihv\u0101dau svayam\neva sphuraty ada\u1e25\n\n\n\u201cNo one can understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as He is by the blunt material senses.

Material nature is called prak\u1e5bti, or the energy of the Lord in His\ndifferent puru\u1e63a incarnations (expansions) as described in the Svatvata Tantra:\n\n\nvi\u1e63\u1e47os tu tr\u012b\u1e47i r\u016bp\u0101\u1e47i puru\u1e63\u0101khy\u0101ny atho vidu\u1e25 ekantu mahata\u1e25 sra\u1e63\u1e6d\u1e5b dvit\u012bya\u1e41 tv\na\u1e47\u1e0da-sa\u1e41sthitam t\u1e5bt\u012bya\u1e41 sarvabh\u016bta-stha\u1e41 t\u0101ni j\u00f1\u0101tv\u0101 vimucyate\n\n\n\u201cFor material creation, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s plenary expansion assumes three Vi\u1e63\u1e47us. The\nfirst one, Mah\u0101-Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, creates the total material energy, known as mahat-tattva.\nThe second, Garbhodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, enters into all the universes to create\ndiversities in each of them. The third, K\u1e63\u012brodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, is diffused as the\nall-pervading Supersoul in all the universes and is known as Param\u0101tm\u0101, who is\npresent even within the atoms. Anyone who knows these three Vi\u1e63\u1e47us can be\nliberated from material entanglement.\u201d\n\n\nThis material world is a temporary manifestation of one of the energies of the\nLord. All the activities of the material world are directed by these three Vi\u1e63\u1e47u\nexpansions of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. These Puru\u1e63as are called incarnations. Generally one\nwho does not know the science of God (K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a) assumes that this material world is\nfor the enjoyment of the living entities and that the living entities are the\ncauses (Puru\u1e63as), controllers and enjoyers of the material energy. According to\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 this atheistic conclusion is false. In the verse under discussion\nit is stated that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the original cause of the material manifestation.\n\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam also confirms this. The ingredients of the material\nmanifestation are separated energies of the Lord. Even the brahmajyoti, which is\nthe ultimate goal of the impersonalists, is a spiritual energy manifested in the\nspiritual sky. There are no spiritual diversities in brahmajyoti as there are in\nthe Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhalokas, and the impersonalist accepts this brahmajyoti as the\nultimate eternal goal. The Param\u0101tm\u0101 manifestation is also a temporary\nall-pervasive aspect of the K\u1e63\u012brodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. The Param\u0101tm\u0101 manifestation is\nnot eternal in the spiritual world. Therefore the factual Absolute Truth is the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He is the complete energetic person, and\nHe possesses different separated and internal energies.\n\n\nIn the material energy, the principal manifestations are eight, as above\nmentioned. Out of these, the first five manifestations, namely earth, water,\nfire, air and sky, are called the five gigantic creations or the gross\ncreations, within which the five sense objects are included. They are the\nmanifestations of physical sound, touch, form, taste and smell. Material science\ncomprises these ten items and nothing more. But the other three items, namely\nmind, intelligence and false ego, are neglected by the materialists.\nPhilosophers who deal with mental activities are also not perfect in knowledge\nbecause they do not know the ultimate source, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The false ego\u2014\u201cI am,\u201d and\n\u201cIt is mine,\u201d which constitute the basic principle of material\nexistence\u2014includes ten sense organs for material activities. Intelligence refers\nto the total material creation, called the mahat-tattva. Therefore from the\neight separated energies of the Lord are manifest the twenty-four elements of\nthe material world, which are the subject matter of s\u0101\u1e45khya atheistic\nphilosophy; they are originally offshoots from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s energies and are\nseparated from Him, but atheistic s\u0101\u1e45khya philosophers with a poor fund of\nknowledge do not know K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the cause of all causes. The subject matter for\ndiscussion in the s\u0101\u1e45khya philosophy is only the manifestation of the external\nenergy of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, as it is described in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.\n\n\n7.5\n\n\napareyam itas tv any\u0101\u1e41\n\n\nprak\u1e5bti\u1e41 viddhi me par\u0101m\n\n\nj\u012bva-bh\u016bt\u0101\u1e41 mah\u0101-b\u0101ho\n\n\nyayeda\u1e41 dh\u0101ryate jagat\n\n\napar\u0101\u2014inferior; iyam\u2014this; ita\u1e25\u2014besides this; tu\u2014but; any\u0101m\u2014another;\nprak\u1e5btim\u2014energy; viddhi\u2014just try to understand; me\u2014My; par\u0101m\u2014superior;\nj\u012bva-bh\u016bt\u0101m\u2014the living entities; mah\u0101-b\u0101ho\u2014O mighty-armed one; yay\u0101\u2014by whom;\nidam\u2014this; dh\u0101ryate\u2014being utilized or exploited; jagat\u2014the material world.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nBesides this inferior nature, O mighty-armed Arjuna, there is a superior energy\nof Mine, which are all living entities who are struggling with material nature\nand are sustaining the universe.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nHere it is clearly mentioned that living entities belong to the superior nature\n(or energy) of the Supreme Lord. The inferior energy is matter manifested in\ndifferent elements, namely earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence\nand false ego. Both forms of material nature, namely gross (earth, etc.) and\nsubtle (mind, etc.), are products of the inferior energy. The living entities,\nwho are exploiting these inferior energies for different purposes, are the\nsuperior energy of the Supreme Lord, and it is due to this energy that the\nentire material world functions. The cosmic manifestation has no power to act\nunless it is moved by the superior energy, the living entity. Energies are\nalways controlled by the energetic, and therefore living entities are always\ncontrolled by the Lord\u2014they have no independant existence. They are never\nequally powerful, as unintelligent men think. The distinction between the living\nentities and the Lord is described in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam as follows (10.87.30):\n\n\naparimit\u0101 dhruv\u0101s tanubh\u1e5bto yadi sarva-gat\u0101s tarhi\u1e41 na \u015b\u0101syateti niyamo dhruva\nnetarath\u0101 ajani ca yanmaya\u1e41 tad avimucya niyant\u1e5b bhavet samam anuj\u0101nat\u0101\u1e41\nyad-amata\u1e41 mata-du\u1e63\u1e6datay\u0101\n\n\n\u201cO Supreme Eternal! If the embodied living entities were eternal and\nall-pervading like You, then they would not be under Your control. But if the\nliving entities are accepted as minute energies of Your Lordship, then they are\nat once subject to Your supreme control. Therefore real liberation entails\nsurrender by the living entities to Your control, and that surrender will make\nthem happy. In that constitutional position only can they be controllers.\nTherefore, men with limited knowledge who advocate the monistic theory that God\nand the living entities are equal in all respects are actually misleading\nthemselves and others.\u201d\n\n\nThe Supreme Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the only controller, and all living entities are\ncontrolled by Him. These living entities are His superior energy because the\nquality of their existence is one and the same with the Supreme, but they are\nnever equal to the Lord in quantity of power. While exploiting the gross and\nsubtle inferior energy (matter), the superior energy (the living entity) forgets\nhis real spiritual mind and intelligence. This forgetfulness is due to the\ninfluence of matter upon the living entity. But when the living entity becomes\nfree from the influence of the illusory material energy, he attains the stage\ncalled mukti, or liberation. The false ego, under the influence of material\nillusion, thinks, \u201cI am matter, and material acquisitions are mine.\u201d His actual\nposition is realized when he is liberated from all material ideas, including the\nconception of his becoming one in all respects with God. Therefore one may\nconclude that the G\u012bt\u0101 confirms the living entity to be only one of the\nmulti-energies of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; and when this energy is freed from material\ncontamination, it becomes fully K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, or liberated.\n\n\n7.6\n\n\netad-yon\u012bni bh\u016bt\u0101ni\n\n\nsarv\u0101\u1e47\u012bty upadh\u0101raya\n\n\naha\u1e41 k\u1e5btsnasya jagata\u1e25\n\n\nprabhava\u1e25 pralayas tath\u0101\n\n\netat\u2014these two natures; yon\u012bni\u2014source of birth; bh\u016bt\u0101ni\u2014everything created;\nsarv\u0101\u1e47i\u2014all; iti\u2014thus; upadh\u0101raya\u2014know; aham\u2014I; k\u1e5btsnasya\u2014all-inclusive;\njagata\u1e25\u2014of the world; prabhava\u1e25\u2014source of manifestation; pralaya\u1e25\u2014annihilation;\ntath\u0101\u2014as well as.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nOf all that is material and all that is spiritual in this world, know for\ncertain that I am both its origin and dissolution.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nEverything that exists is a product of matter and spirit. Spirit is the basic\nfield of creation, and matter is created by spirit. Spirit is not created at a\ncertain stage of material development. Rather, this material world is manifested\nonly on the basis of spiritual energy. This material body is developed because\nspirit is present within matter; a child grows gradually to boyhood and then to\nmanhood because of that superior energy, spirit soul, being present. Similarly,\nthe entire cosmic manifestation of the gigantic universe is developed because of\nthe presence of the Supersoul, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Therefore spirit and matter, which combine\ntogether to manifest this gigantic universal form, are originally two energies\nof the Lord, and consequently the Lord is the original cause of everything. A\nfragmental part and parcel of the Lord, namely, the living entity, may by\nmanipulation of material energy construct a skyscraper, factory or city, but he\ncannot create matter out of nothing, and he certainly cannot construct a planet\nor a universe. The cause of the universe is the Supersoul, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the supreme\ncreator of all individual souls and the original cause of all causes, as the\nKa\u1e6dha Upani\u1e63ad confirms: nityo nity\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 cetana\u015b cetan\u0101n\u0101m.\n\n\n7.7\n\n\nmatta\u1e25 paratara\u1e41 n\u0101nyat\n\n\nki\u00f1cid asti dhana\u00f1jaya\n\n\nmayi sarvam ida\u1e41 prota\u1e41\n\n\ns\u016btre ma\u1e47i-ga\u1e47\u0101 iva\n\n\nmatta\u1e25\u2014beyond Myself; parataram\u2014superior; na\u2014not; anyat\u2014anything else;\nki\u00f1cit\u2014something; asti\u2014there is; dhana\u00f1jaya\u2014O conquerer of wealth; mayi\u2014in Me;\nsarvam\u2014all that be; idam\u2014which we see; protam\u2014strung; s\u016btre\u2014on a thread;\nma\u1e47i-ga\u1e47\u0101\u1e25\u2014pearls; iva\u2014likened.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nO conquerer of wealth [Arjuna], there is no Truth superior to Me. Everything\nrests upon Me, as pearls are strung on a thread.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThere is a common controversy over whether the Supreme Absolute Truth is\npersonal or impersonal. As far as Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is concerned, the Absolute Truth\nis the Personality of Godhead \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and this is confirmed in every step. In\nthis verse, in particular, it is stressed that the Absolute Truth is a person.\nThat the Personality of Godhead is the Supreme Absolute Truth is also the\naffirmation of the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101: \u012b\u015bvara\u1e25 parama\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u1e25\nsac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha\u1e25; that is, the Supreme Absolute Truth Personality of\nGodhead is Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who is the primeval Lord, the reservoir of all pleasure,\nGovinda, and the eternal form of complete bliss and knowledge. These authorities\nleave no doubt that the Absolute Truth is the Supreme Person, the cause of all\ncauses. The impersonalist, however, argues on the strength of the Vedic version\ngiven in the \u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad: tato yad uttaratara\u1e41 tad ar\u016bpam an\u0101maya\u1e41 ya\netad vidur am\u1e5bt\u0101s te bhavanti athetare du\u1e25kham ev\u0101pi yanti. \u201cIn the material\nworld Brahm\u0101, the primeval living entity within the universe, is understood to\nbe the supreme amongst the demigods, human beings and lower animals. But beyond\nBrahm\u0101 there is the Transcendence who has no material form and is free from all\nmaterial contaminations. Anyone who can know Him also becomes transcendental,\nbut those who do not know Him suffer the miseries of the material world.\u201d\n\n\nThe impersonalist puts more stress on the word ar\u016bpam. But this ar\u016bpam is not\nimpersonal. It indicates the transcendental form of eternity, bliss and\nknowledge as described in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 quoted above.

The Supreme Lord can be preliminarily perceived by His\ndifferent energies, and in this way He is realized impersonally. As the demigod\nin the sun is a person and is perceived by his all-pervading energy, the\nsunshine, similarly, the Lord, although in His eternal abode, is perceived by\nHis all-pervading, diffusive energies. The taste of water is the active\nprinciple of water. No one likes to drink sea water because the pure taste of\nwater is mixed with salt. Attraction for water depends on the purity of the\ntaste, and this pure taste is one of the energies of the Lord. The impersonalist\nperceives the presence of the Lord in water by its taste, and the personalist\nalso glorifies the Lord for His kindly supplying water to quench man\u2019s thirst.\nThat is the way of perceiving the Supreme. Practically speaking, there is no\nconflict between personalism and impersonalism. One who knows God knows that the\nimpersonal conception and personal conception are simultaneously present in\neverything and that there is no contradiction. Therefore Lord Caitanya\nestablished His sublime doctrine: acintya-bheda and\nabheda-tattvam\u2014simultaneously one and different.\n\n\nThe light of the sun and the moon is also originally emanating from the\nbrahmajyoti, which is the impersonal effulgence of the Lord. Similarly pra\u1e47ava\nor the omk\u0101ra transcendental sound used in the beginning of every Vedic hymn to\naddress the Supreme Lord also emanates from Him. Because the impersonalists are\nvery much afraid of addressing the Supreme Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by His innumerable names,\nthey prefer to vibrate the transcendental sound omk\u0101ra. But they do not realize\nthat omk\u0101ra is the sound representation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The jurisdiction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness extends everywhere, and one who knows K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is\nblessed. Those who do not know K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are in illusion, and so knowledge of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nis liberation, and ignorance of Him is bondage.\n\n\n7.9\n\n\npu\u1e47yo gandha\u1e25 p\u1e5bthivy\u0101\u1e41 ca\n\n\nteja\u015b c\u0101smi vibh\u0101vasau\n\n\nj\u012bvana\u1e41 sarva-bh\u016bte\u1e63u\n\n\ntapa\u015b c\u0101smi tapasvi\u1e63u\n\n\npu\u1e47ya\u1e25\u2014original; gandha\u1e25\u2014fragrance; p\u1e5bthivy\u0101m\u2014in the earth; ca\u2014also;\nteja\u1e25\u2014temperature; ca\u2014also; asmi\u2014I am; vibh\u0101vasau\u2014in the fire; j\u012bvanam\u2014life;\nsarva\u2014all; bh\u016bte\u1e63u\u2014living entities; tapa\u1e25\u2014penance; ca\u2014also; asmi\u2014I am;\ntapasvi\u1e63u\u2014in those who practice penance.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nI am the original fragrance of the earth, and I am the heat in fire. I am the\nlife of all that lives, and I am the penances of all ascetics.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nPu\u1e47ya means that which is not decomposed; pu\u1e47ya is original. Everything in the\nmaterial world has a certain flavor or fragrance, as the flavor and fragrance in\na flower, or in the earth, in water, in fire, in air, etc. The uncontaminated\nflavor, the original flavor, which permeates everything, is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Similarly,\neverything has a particular original taste, and this taste can be changed by the\nmixture of chemicals. So everything original has some smell, some fragrance, and\nsome taste. Vibh\u0101va means fire. Without fire we cannot run factories, we cannot\ncook, etc., and that fire is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The heat in the fire is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. According to\nVedic medicine, indigestion is due to a low temperature in the belly. So even\nfor digestion fire is needed. In K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness we become aware that earth,\nwater, fire, air and every active principle, all chemicals and all material\nelements are due to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The duration of man\u2019s life is also due to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\nTherefore by the grace of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, man can prolong his life or diminish it. So\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is active in every sphere.\n\n\n7.10\n\n\nb\u012bja\u1e41 m\u0101\u1e41 sarva-bh\u016bt\u0101n\u0101\u1e41\n\n\nviddhi p\u0101rtha san\u0101tanam\n\n\nbuddhir buddhimat\u0101m asmi\n\n\ntejas tejasvin\u0101m aham\n\n\nb\u012bjam\u2014seed; m\u0101m\u2014unto Me; sarva-bh\u016bt\u0101n\u0101m\u2014of all living entities; viddhi\u2014try to\nunderstand; p\u0101rtha\u2014O son of P\u1e5bth\u0101; san\u0101tanam\u2014original, eternal;\nbuddhi\u1e25\u2014intelligence; buddhimat\u0101m\u2014of the intelligent; asmi\u2014I am; teja\u1e25\u2014prowess;\ntejasvin\u0101m\u2014of the powerful; aham\u2014I am.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nO son of P\u1e5bth\u0101, know that I am the original seed of all existences, the\nintelligence of the intelligent, and the prowess of all powerful men.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nB\u012bjam means seed; K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the seed of everything. In contact with material\nnature, the seed fructifies into various living entities, movable and inert.\nBirds, beasts, men and many other living creatures are moving living entities;\ntrees and plants, however, are inert\u2014they cannot move, but only stand. Every\nentity is contained within the scope of 8,400,000 species of life; some of them\nare moving and some of them are inert. In all cases, however, the seed of their\nlife is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. As stated in Vedic literature, Brahman, or the Supreme Absolute\nTruth, is that from which everything is emanating. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is Parabrahman, the\nSupreme Spirit. Brahman is impersonal and Parabrahman is personal. Impersonal\nBrahman is situated in the personal aspect\u2014that is stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.\nTherefore, originally, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the source of everything. He is the root. As the\nroot of a tree maintains the whole tree, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, being the original root of all\nthings, maintains everything in this material manifestation. This is also\nconfirmed in the Vedic literature. Yato v\u0101 im\u0101ni bh\u016bt\u0101ni j\u0101yante. \u201cThe Supreme\nAbsolute Truth is that from which everything is born.\u201d He is the prime eternal\namong all eternals. He is the supreme living entity of all living entities, and\nHe alone is maintaining all life. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a also says that He is the root of all\nintelligence. Unless a person is intelligent he cannot understand the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\n\n\n7.11\n\n\nbala\u1e41 balavat\u0101\u1e41 c\u0101ha\u1e41\n\n\nk\u0101ma-r\u0101ga-vivarjitam\n\n\ndharm\u0101viruddho bh\u016bte\u1e63u\n\n\nk\u0101mo \u2019smi bharatar\u1e63abha\n\n\nbalam\u2014strength; balavat\u0101m\u2014of the strong; ca\u2014and; aham\u2014I am; k\u0101ma\u2014passion;\nr\u0101ga\u2014attachment; vivarjitam\u2014devoid of; dharma-aviruddha\u2014not against the\nreligious principles; bh\u016bte\u1e63u\u2014in all beings; k\u0101ma\u1e25\u2014sex-life; asmi\u2014I am;\nbharatar\u1e63abha\u2014O lord of the Bh\u0101ratas.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nI am the strength of the strong, devoid of passion and desire.

Although these material modes of nature are emanations from\nthe Supreme Lord, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, He is not subject to them. For instance, under the\nstate laws one may be punished, but the king, the lawmaker, is not subject to\nthat law. Similarly, all the modes of material nature\u2014goodness, passion and\nignorance\u2014are emanations from the Supreme Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not subject\nto material nature. Therefore He is nirgu\u1e47a, which means that these gu\u1e47as, or\nmodes, although issuing from Him, do not affect Him. That is one of the special\ncharacteristics of Bhagav\u0101n, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\n\n\n7.13\n\n\ntribhir gu\u1e47a-mayair bh\u0101vair\n\n\nebhi\u1e25 sarvam ida\u1e41 jagat\n\n\nmohita\u1e41 n\u0101bhij\u0101n\u0101ti\n\n\nm\u0101m ebhya\u1e25 param avyayam\n\n\ntribhi\u1e25\u2014three; gu\u1e47amayai\u1e25\u2014by the three gu\u1e47as; bh\u0101vai\u1e25\u2014state of being; ebhi\u1e25\u2014all\nthis; sarvam\u2014the whole world; idam\u2014in this world; jagat\u2014universe;\nmohitam\u2014deluded; na abhij\u0101n\u0101ti\u2014do not know; m\u0101m\u2014unto Me; ebhya\u1e25\u2014above these;\nparam\u2014the Supreme; avyayam\u2014inexhaustible.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nDeluded by the three modes [goodness, passion and ignorance], the whole world\ndoes not know Me who am above the modes and inexhaustible.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe whole world is enchanted by three modes of material nature. Those who are\nbewildered by these three modes cannot understand that transcendental to this\nmaterial nature is the Supreme Lord, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In this material world everyone is\nunder the influence of these three gu\u1e47as and is thus bewildered.\n\n\nBv nature living entities have particular types of body and particular types of\npsychic and biological activities accordingly. There are four classes of men\nfunctioning in the three material modes of nature. Those who are purely in the\nmode of goodness are called br\u0101hma\u1e47as. Those who are purely in the mode of\npassion are called k\u1e63atriyas. Those who are in the modes of both passion and\nignorance are called vai\u015byas. Those who are completely in ignorance are called\n\u015b\u016bdras. And those who are less than that are animals or animal life. However,\nthese designations are not permanent. I may either be a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, k\u1e63atriya,\nvai\u015bya or whatever\u2014in any case, this life is temporary. But although life is\ntemporary and we do not know what we are going to be in the next life, still, by\nthe spell of this illusory energy, we consider ourselves in the light of this\nbodily conception of life, and we thus think that we are American, Indian,\nRussian or br\u0101hma\u1e47a, Hindu, Muslim, etc. And if we become entangled with the\nmodes of material nature, then we forget the Supreme Personality of Godhead who\nis behind all these modes. So Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says that men, deluded by these three\nmodes of nature, do not understand that behind the material background is the\nSupreme Godhead.\n\n\nThere are many different kinds of living entities\u2014human beings, demigods,\nanimals, etc.\u2014and each and every one of them is under the influence of material\nnature, and all of them have forgotten the transcendent Personality of Godhead.\nThose who are in the modes of passion and ignorance, and even those who are in\nthe mode of goodness, cannot go beyond the impersonal Brahman conception of the\nAbsolute Truth. They are bewildered before the Supreme Lord in His personal\nfeature, which possesses all beauty, opulence, knowledge, strength, fame and\nrenunciation. When even those who are in goodness cannot understand, what hope\nis there for those in passion and ignorance? K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is\ntranscendental to all these three modes of material nature, and those who are\ntruly established in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness are actually liberated.### 7.14\n\n\ndaiv\u012b hy e\u1e63\u0101 gu\u1e47a-may\u012b\n\n\nmama m\u0101y\u0101 duratyay\u0101\n\n\nm\u0101m eva ye prapadyante\n\n\nm\u0101y\u0101m et\u0101\u1e41 taranti te\n\n\ndaiv\u012b\u2014transcendental; hi\u2014certainly; e\u1e63\u0101\u2014this; gu\u1e47amay\u012b\u2014consisting of the three\nmodes of material nature; mama\u2014My; m\u0101y\u0101\u2014energy; duratyay\u0101\u2014very difficult to\novercome; m\u0101m\u2014unto Me; eva\u2014certainly; ye\u2014those; prapadyante\u2014surrender; m\u0101y\u0101m\net\u0101m\u2014this illusory energy; taranti\u2014overcome; te\u2014they.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThis divine energy of Mine, consisting of the three modes of material nature, is\ndifficult to overcome. But those who have surrendered unto Me can easily cross\nbeyond it.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe Supreme Personality of Godhead has innumerable energies, and all these\nenergies are divine. Although the living entities are part of His energies and\nare therefore divine, due to contact with material energy, their original\nsuperior power is covered. Being thus covered by material energy, one cannot\npossibly overcome its influence. As previously stated, both the material and\nspiritual natures, being emanations from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, are\neternal. The living entities belong to the eternal superior nature of the Lord,\nbut due to contamination by the inferior nature, matter, their illusion is also\neternal. The conditioned soul is therefore called nitya-baddha, or eternally\nconditioned. No one can trace out the history of his becoming conditioned at a\ncertain date in material history. Consequently, his release from the clutches of\nmaterial nature is very difficult, even though that material nature is an\ninferior energy, because material energy is ultimately conducted by the supreme\nwill, which the living entity cannot overcome. Inferior material nature is\ndefined herein as divine nature due to its divine connection and movement by the\ndivine will. Being conducted by divine will, material nature, although inferior,\nacts so wonderfully in the construction and destruction of the cosmic\nmanifestation. The Vedas confirm this as follows:\n\n\nm\u0101y\u0101\u1e41 tu prak\u1e5bti\u1e41 vidy\u0101n m\u0101yina\u1e41 tu mahe\u015bvaram.\n\n\n\u201cAlthough m\u0101y\u0101 [illusion] is false or temporary, the background of m\u0101y\u0101 is the\nsupreme magician, the Personality of Godhead, who is Mahe\u015bvara, the supreme\ncontroller.\u201d\n\n\nAnother meaning of gu\u1e47a is rope; it is to be understood that the conditioned\nsoul is tightly tied by the ropes of illusion. A man bound by the hands and feet\ncannot free himself\u2014he must be helped by a person who is unbound. Because the\nbound cannot help the bound, the rescuer must be liberated. Therefore, only Lord\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or His bona fide representative the spiritual master, can release the\nconditioned soul. Without such superior help, one cannot be freed from the\nbondage of material nature. Devotional service, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, can help\none gain such release. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, being the Lord of illusory energy, can order this\ninsurmountable energy to release the conditioned soul. He orders this release\nout of His causeless mercy on the surrendered soul and out of His paternal\naffection for the living entity who is originally a beloved son of the Lord.\nTherefore surrender unto the lotus feet of the Lord is the only means to get\nfree from the clutches of the stringent material nature.\n\n\nThe words m\u0101m eva are also significant. M\u0101m means unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (Vi\u1e63\u1e47u) only, and\nnot Brahm\u0101 or \u015aiva. Although Brahm\u0101 and \u015aiva are greatly elevated and are almost\non the level of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, it is not possible for such incarnations of r\u0101jo-gu\u1e47a\n(passion) and tamo-gu\u1e47a (ignorance) to release the conditioned soul from the\nclutches of m\u0101y\u0101. In other words, both Brahm\u0101 and \u015aiva are also under the\ninfluence of m\u0101y\u0101. Only Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is the master of m\u0101y\u0101; therefore He can alone give\nrelease to the conditioned soul.

At this point a question arises: How is it that educated\nphilosophers, scientists, businessmen, administrators and all the leaders of\nordinary men do not surrender to the lotus feet of \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the all-powerful\nPersonality of Godhead? Mukti, or liberation from the laws of material nature,\nis sought by the leaders of mankind in different ways and with great plans and\nperseverance for a great many years and births. But if that liberation is\npossible by simply surrendering unto the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality\nof Godhead, then why don\u2019t these intelligent and hard-working leaders adopt this\nsimple method?\n\n\nThe G\u012bt\u0101 answers this question very frankly. Those really learned leaders of\nsociety like Brahm\u0101, \u015aiva, Kapila, the Kum\u0101ras, Manu, Vy\u0101sa, Devala, Asita,\nJanaka, Prahl\u0101da, Bali, and later on Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya, R\u0101m\u0101nuj\u0101c\u0101rya, \u015ar\u012b Caitanya\nand many others\u2014who are faithful philosophers, politicians, educators,\nscientists, etc.\u2014surrender to the lotus feet of the Supreme Person, the\nall-powerful authority. Those who are not actually philosophers, scientists,\neducators, administrators, etc., but who pose themselves as such for material\ngain, do not accept the plan or path of the Supreme Lord. They have no idea of\nGod; they simply manufacture their own worldly plans and consequently complicate\nthe problems of material existence in their vain attempts to solve them. Because\nmaterial energy (nature) is so powerful, it can resist the unauthorized plans of\nthe atheists and baffle the knowledge of \u201cplanning commissions.\u201d\n\n\nThe atheistic plan-makers are described herein by the word du\u1e63k\u1e5btina, or\n\u201cmiscreants.\u201d K\u1e5btina means one who has performed meritorious work. The atheist\nplanmaker is sometimes very intelligent and meritorious also, because any\ngigantic plan, good or bad, must take intelligence to execute. But because the\natheist\u2019s brain is improperly utilized in opposing the plan of the Supreme Lord,\nthe atheistic planmaker is called du\u1e63k\u1e5btina, which indicates that his\nintelligence and efforts are misdirected.\n\n\nIn the G\u012bt\u0101 it is clearly mentioned that material energy works fully under the\ndirection of the Supreme Lord. It has no independant authority. It works as the\nshadow moves, in accordance with the movements of the object. But still material\nenergy is very powerful, and the atheist, due to his godless temperament, cannot\nknow how it works; nor can he know the plan of the Supreme Lord. Under illusion\nand the modes of passion and ignorance, all his plans are baffled, as in the\ncase of Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu and R\u0101va\u1e47a, whose plans were smashed to dust although they\nwere both materially learned as scientists, philosophers, administrators and\neducators. These du\u1e63k\u1e5btinas, or miscreants, are of four different patterns, as\noutlined below:\n\n\n(1) The m\u016b\u1e0dhas are those who are grossly foolish, like hard-working beasts of\nburden. They want to enjoy the fruits of their labor by themselves, and so do\nnot want to part with them for the Supreme. The typical example of the beast of\nburden is the ass. This humble beast is made to work very hard by his master.\nThe ass does not really know for whom he works so hard day and night. He remains\nsatisfied by filling his stomach with a bundle of grass, sleeping for a while\nunder fear of being beaten by his master, and satisfying his sex appetite at the\nrisk of being repeatedly kicked by the opposite party. The ass sings poetry and\nphilosophy sometimes, but this braying only disturbs others. This is the\nposition of the foolish fruitive worker who does not know for whom he should\nwork. He does not know that karma (action) is meant for yaj\u00f1a (sacrifice).\n\n\nMost often, those who work very hard day and night to clear the burden of\nself-created duties say that they have no time to hear of the immortality of the\nliving being. To such m\u016b\u1e0dhas, material gains, which are destructible, are life\u2019s\nall in all\u2014despite the fact that the m\u016b\u1e0dhas enjoy only a very small fraction of\nthe fruit of labor. Sometimes they spend sleepless days and nights for fruitive\ngain, and although they may have ulcers or indigestion, they are satisfied with\npractically no food; they are simply absorbed in working hard day and night for\nthe benefit of illusory masters. Ignorant of their real master, the foolish\nworkers waste their valuable time serving mammon. Unfortunately, they never\nsurrender to the supreme master of all masters, nor do they take time to hear of\nHim from the proper sources. The swine who eat the soil do not care to accept\nsweetmeats made of sugar and ghee. Similarly, the foolish worker will untiringly\ncontinue to hear of the sense-enjoyable tidings of the flickering mundane force\nthat moves the material world.\n\n\n(2) Another class of du\u1e63k\u1e5btina, or miscreant, is called the nar\u0101dhama, or the\nlowest of mankind. Nara means human being, and adhama means the lowest. Out of\nthe 8,400,000 different species of living beings, there are 400,000 human\nspecies. Out of these there are numerous lower forms of human life that are\nmostly uncivilized. The civilized human beings are those who have regulated\nprinciples of social, political and religious life. Those who are socially and\npolitically developed, but who have no religious principles, must be considered\nnar\u0101dhamas. Nor is religion without God religion, because the purpose of\nfollowing religious principles is to know the Supreme Truth and man\u2019s relation\nwith Him. In the G\u012bt\u0101 the Personality of Godhead clearly states that there is no\nauthority above Him and that He is the Supreme Truth. The civilized form of\nhuman life is meant for man\u2019s reviving the lost consciousness of his eternal\nrelation with the Supreme Truth, the Personality of Godhead \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who is\nall-powerful. Whoever loses this chance is classified as a nar\u0101dhama. We get\ninformation from revealed scriptures that when the baby is in the mother\u2019s womb\n(an extremely uncomfortable situation) he prays to God for deliverance and\npromises to worship Him alone as soon as he gets out. To pray to God when he is\nin difficulty is a natural instinct in every living being because he is\neternally related with God. But after his deliverance, the child forgets the\ndifficulties of birth and forgets his deliverer also, being influenced by m\u0101y\u0101,\nthe illusory energy.\n\n\nIt is the duty of the guardians of children to revive the divine consciousness\ndormant in them. The ten processes of reformatory ceremonies, as enjoined in the\nManu-sm\u1e5bti, which is the guide to religious principles, are meant for reviving\nGod consciousness in the system of var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama. However, no process is strictly\nfollowed now in any part of the world, and therefore 99.9 percent of the\npopulation is nar\u0101dhama.\n\n\nWhen the whole population becomes nar\u0101dhama, naturally all their so-called\neducation is made null and void by the all-powerful energy of physical nature.\nAccording to the standard of the G\u012bt\u0101, a learned man is he who sees on equal\nterms the learned br\u0101hma\u1e47a, the dog, the cow, the elephant and the dog-eater.\nThat is the vision of a true devotee. \u015ar\u012b Nity\u0101nanda Prabhu, who is the\nincarnation of Godhead as divine master, delivered the typical nar\u0101dhamas, the\nbrothers Jagai and Madhai, and showed how the mercy of a real devotee is\nbestowed upon the lowest of mankind. So the nar\u0101dhama who is condemned by the\nPersonality of Godhead can again revive his spiritual consciousness only by the\nmercy of a devotee.\n\n\n\u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, in propagating the bh\u0101gavata-dharma or activities of\nthe devotees, has recommended that people submissively hear the message of the\nPersonality of Godhead. The essence of this message is Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. The lowest\namongst human beings can be delivered by this submissive hearing process only,\nbut unfortunately they even deny giving an aural reception to these messages,\nand what to speak of surrendering to the will of the Supreme Lord? Nar\u0101dhamas,\nor the lowest of mankind, will fully neglect the prime duty of the human being.\n\n\n(3) The next class of du\u1e63k\u1e5btina is called m\u0101yay\u0101pah\u1e5bta-j\u00f1\u0101na, or those persons\nwhose erudite knowledge has been nullified by the influence of illusory material\nenergy. They are mostly very learned fellows\u2014great philosophers, poets,\nliterati, scientists, etc.\u2014but the illusory energy misguides them, and therefore\nthey disobey the Supreme Lord.\n\n\nThere are a great number of m\u0101yay\u0101pah\u1e5bta-j\u00f1\u0101nas at the present moment, even\namongst the scholars of the G\u012bt\u0101. In the G\u012bt\u0101, in plain and simple language, it\nis stated that \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. There is none\nequal to or greater than Him. He is mentioned as the father of Brahm\u0101, the\noriginal father of all human beings. In fact, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is said to be not only\nthe father of Brahm\u0101 but also the father of all species of life. He is the root\nof the impersonal Brahman and Param\u0101tm\u0101; the Supersoul in every entity is His\nplenary portion. He is the fountainhead of everything, and everyone is advised\nto surrender unto His lotus feet. Despite all these clear statements, the\nm\u0101yay\u0101pah\u1e5bta-j\u00f1\u0101na deride the Personality of the Supreme Lord and consider Him\nmerely another human being. They do not know that the blessed form of human life\nis designed after the eternal and transcendental feature of the Supreme Lord.\n\n\nAll the unauthorized interpretations of the G\u012bt\u0101 by the class of\nm\u0101yay\u0101pah\u1e5bta-j\u00f1\u0101na, outside the purview of the parampar\u0101 system, are so many\nstumbling blocks in the path of spiritual understanding. The deluded\ninterpreters do not surrender unto the lotus feet of \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, nor do they\nteach others to follow this principle.\n\n\n(4) The last class of du\u1e63k\u1e5btina is called \u0101sura\u1e41 bh\u0101vam \u0101\u015brita, or those of\ndemonic principles. This class is openly atheistic. Some of them argue that the\nSupreme Lord can never descend upon this material world, but they are unable to\ngive any tangible reasons as to why not. There are others who make Him\nsubordinate to the impersonal feature, although the opposite is declared in the\nG\u012bt\u0101. Envious of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the atheist will present a\nnumber of illicit incarnations manufactured in the factory of his brain. Such\npersons whose very principle of life is to decry the Personality of Godhead\ncannot surrender unto the lotus feet of \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\n\n\n\u015ar\u012b Y\u0101mun\u0101c\u0101rya Albandru of South India said, \u201cO my Lord! You are unknowable to\npersons involved with atheistic principles despite Your uncommon qualities,\nfeatures, and activities and despite Your personality being confirmed by all the\nrevealed scriptures in the quality of goodness, and despite Your being\nacknowledged by the famous authorities renowned for their depth of knowledge in\nthe transcendental science and situated in the godly qualities.\u201d\n\n\nTherefore, (1) grossly foolish persons, (2) the lowest of mankind, (3) the\ndeluded speculators, and (4) the professed atheists, as above mentioned, never\nsurrender unto the lotus feet of the Personality of Godhead in spite of all\nscriptural and authoritative advice.\n\n\n7.16\n\n\ncatur-vidh\u0101 bhajante m\u0101\u1e41\n\n\njan\u0101\u1e25 suk\u1e5btino \u2019rjuna\n\n\n\u0101rto jij\u00f1\u0101sur arth\u0101rth\u012b\n\n\nj\u00f1\u0101n\u012b ca bharatar\u1e63abha\n\n\ncatur-vidh\u0101\u1e25\u2014four kinds of; bhajante\u2014render services; m\u0101m\u2014unto Me;\njan\u0101\u1e25\u2014persons; suk\u1e5btina\u1e25\u2014those who are pious; arjuna\u2014O Arjuna; \u0101rta\u1e25\u2014the\ndistressed; jij\u00f1\u0101su\u1e25\u2014the inquisitive; artha-arth\u012b\u2014one who desires material gain;\nj\u00f1\u0101n\u012b\u2014one who knows things as they are; ca\u2014also; bharatar\u1e63abha\u2014O great one\namongst the descendants of Bharata.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nO best among the Bh\u0101ratas [Arjuna], four kinds of pious men render devotional\nservice unto Me\u2014the distressed, the desirer of wealth, the inquisitive, and he\nwho is searching for knowledge of the Absolute.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nUnlike the miscreants, these are adherents of the regulative principles of the\nscriptures, and they are called suk\u1e5btina, or those who obey the rules and\nregulations of scriptures, the moral and social laws, and are, more or less,\ndevoted to the Supreme Lord. Out of these there are four classes of men\u2014those\nwho are sometimes distressed, those who are in need of money, those who are\nsometimes inquisitive, and those who are sometimes searching after knowledge of\nthe Absolute Truth. These persons come to the Supreme Lord for devotional\nservice under different conditions. These are not pure devotees because they\nhave some aspiration to fulfill in exchange for devotional service. Pure\ndevotional service is without aspiration and without desire for material profit.\nThe Bhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu defines pure devotion thus:\n\n\nany\u0101bhil\u0101\u1e63it\u0101\u015b\u016bnya\u1e41 j\u00f1\u0101na-karm\u0101dy-an\u0101v\u1e5btam \u0101nuk\u016blyena k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47\u0101nu\u015b\u012blana\u1e41 bhaktir\nuttam\u0101.\n\n\n\u201cOne should render transcendental loving service to the Supreme Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nfavorably and without desire for material profit or gain through fruitive\nactivities or philosophical speculation. That is called pure devotional\nservice.\u201d\n\n\nWhen these four kinds of persons come to the Supreme Lord for devotional service\nand are completely purified by the association of a pure devotee, they also\nbecome pure devotees. As far as the miscreants are concerned, for them\ndevotional service is very difficult because their lives are selfish, irregular\nand without spiritual goals. But even some of them, by chance, when they come in\ncontact with a pure devotee, also become pure devotees.\n\n\nThose who are always busy with fruitive activities come to the Lord in material\ndistress and at that time associate with pure devotees and become, in their\ndistress, devotees of the Lord. Those who are simply frustrated also come\nsometimes to associate with the pure devotees and become inquisitive to know\nabout God. Similarly, when the dry philosophers are frustrated in every field of\nknowledge, they sometimes want to learn of God, and they come to the Supreme\nLord to render devotional service and thus transcend knowledge of the impersonal\nBrahman and the localized Param\u0101tm\u0101 and come to the personal conception of\nGodhead by the grace of the Supreme Lord or His pure devotee. On the whole, when\nthe distressed, the inquisitive, the seekers of knowledge, and those who are in\nneed of money are free from all material desires, and when they fully understand\nthat material remuneration has nothing to do with spiritual improvement, they\nbecome pure devotees. As long as such a purified stage is not attained, devotees\nin transcendental service to the Lord are tainted with fruitive activities, and\nthey search after mundane knowledge, etc. So one has to transcend all this\nbefore one can come to the stage of pure devotional service.\n\n\n7.17\n\n\nte\u1e63\u0101\u1e41 j\u00f1\u0101n\u012b nitya-yukta\n\n\neka-bhaktir vi\u015bi\u1e63yate\n\n\npriyo hi j\u00f1\u0101nino \u2019tyartham\n\n\naha\u1e41 sa ca mama priya\u1e25\n\n\nte\u1e63\u0101m\u2014out of them; j\u00f1\u0101n\u012b\u2014one in full knowledge; nitya-yukta\u1e25\u2014always engaged;\neka\u2014only one; bhakti\u1e25\u2014devotional service; vi\u015bi\u1e63yate\u2014especially; priya\u1e25\u2014very\ndear; hi\u2014certainly; j\u00f1\u0101nina\u1e25\u2014person in knowledge; atyartham highly; aham\u2014I am;\nsa\u1e25\u2014he; ca\u2014also; mama\u2014Mine; priya\u1e25\u2014dear.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nOf these, the wise one who is in full knowledge in union with Me through pure\ndevotional service is the best. For I am very dear to him, and he is dear to Me.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nFree from all contaminations of material desires, the distressed, the\ninquisitive, the penniless, and the seeker after supreme knowledge can all\nbecome pure devotees. But out of them, he who is in knowledge of the Absolute\nTruth and free from all material desires becomes a really pure devotee of the\nLord. And of the four orders, the devotee who is in full knowledge and is at the\nsame time engaged in devotional service is, the Lord says, the best. By\nsearching after knowledge one realizes that his self is different from his\nmaterial body, and when further advanced he comes to the knowledge of impersonal\nBrahman and Param\u0101tm\u0101. When one is fully purified, he realizes that his\nconstitutional position is to be the eternal servant of God. So by association\nwith pure devotees, the inquisitive, the distressed, the seeker after material\namelioration and the man in knowledge all become themselves pure. But in the\npreparatory stage, the man who is in full knowledge of the Supreme Lord and is\nat the same time executing devotional service is very dear to the Lord. He who\nis situated in pure knowledge of the transcendence of the Supreme Personality of\nGod is so protected in devotional service that material contaminations cannot\ntouch him.\n\n\n7.18\n\n\nud\u0101r\u0101\u1e25 sarva evaite\n\n\nj\u00f1\u0101n\u012b tv \u0101tmaiva me matam\n\n\n\u0101sthita\u1e25 sa hi yukt\u0101tm\u0101\n\n\nm\u0101m ev\u0101nuttam\u0101\u1e41 gatim\n\n\nud\u0101r\u0101\u1e25\u2014magnanimous; sarve\u2014all; eva\u2014certainly; ete\u2014these; j\u00f1\u0101n\u012b\u2014one who is in\nknowledge; tu\u2014but; \u0101tm\u0101 eva\u2014just like Myself; me\u2014Mine; matam\u2014opinion;\n\u0101sthita\u1e25\u2014situated; sa\u1e25\u2014he; hi\u2014certainly; yukta-\u0101tm\u0101\u2014engaged in devotional\nservice; m\u0101m\u2014unto Me; eva\u2014certainly; anuttam\u0101m\u2014the highest goal;\ngatim\u2014destination.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nAll these devotees are undoubtedly magnanimous souls, but he who is situated in\nknowledge of Me I consider verily to dwell in Me. Being engaged in My\ntranscendental service, he attains Me.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nIt is not that other devotees who are less complete in knowledge are not dear to\nthe Lord. The Lord says that all are magnanimous because anyone who comes to the\nLord for any purpose is called a mah\u0101tm\u0101 or great soul. The devotees who want\nsome benefit out of devotional service are accepted by the Lord because there is\nan exchange of affection. Out of affection they ask the Lord for some material\nbenefit, and when they get it they become so satisfied that they also advance in\ndevotional service. But the devotee in full knowledge is considered to be very\ndear to the Lord because his only purpose is to serve the Supreme Lord with love\nand devotion. Such a devotee cannot live a second without contacting or serving\nthe Supreme Lord. Similarly, the Supreme Lord is very fond of His devotee and\ncannot be separated from him.\n\n\nIn the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (9.4.57), the Lord says:\n\n\naha\u1e41 bhakta-par\u0101dh\u012bno hy asvatantra iva dvija s\u0101dhubhir grasta-h\u1e5bdayo bhaktair\nbhakta-jana-priya\u1e25\n\n\n\u201cThe devotees are always in My heart, and I am always in the heart of the\ndevotees. The devotee does not know anything beyond Me, and I also cannot forget\nthe devotee. There is a very intimate relationship between Me and the pure\ndevotees. Pure devotees in full knowledge are never out of spiritual touch, and\ntherefore they are very much dear to Me.\u201d\n\n\n7.19\n\n\nbah\u016bn\u0101\u1e41 janman\u0101m ante\n\n\nj\u00f1\u0101nav\u0101n m\u0101\u1e41 prapadyate\n\n\nv\u0101sudeva\u1e25 sarvam iti\n\n\nsa mah\u0101tm\u0101 su-durlabha\u1e25\n\n\nbah\u016bn\u0101m\u2014many; janman\u0101m\u2014births; ante\u2014after; j\u00f1\u0101nav\u0101n\u2014he possessing knowledge;\nm\u0101m\u2014unto Me; prapadyate\u2014surrenders; v\u0101sudeva\u1e25\u2014cause of all causes; sarvam\u2014all;\niti\u2014thus; sa\u1e25\u2014such; mah\u0101tm\u0101\u2014great soul; sudurlabha\u1e25\u2014very rare.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nAfter many births and deaths, he who is actually in knowledge surrenders unto\nMe, knowing Me to be the cause of all causes and all that is. Such a great soul\nis very rare.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe living entity, while executing devotional service or transcendental rituals\nafter many, many births, may actually become situated in transcendental pure\nknowledge that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the ultimate goal of\nspiritual realization. In the beginning of spiritual realization, while one is\ntrying to give up one\u2019s attachment to materialism, there is some leaning towards\nimpersonalism, but when one is further advanced he can understand that there are\nactivities in the spiritual life and that these activities constitute devotional\nservice. Realizing this, he becomes attached to the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead and surrenders to Him. At such a time one can understand that Lord \u015ar\u012b\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s mercy is everything, that He is the cause of all causes and that this\nmaterial manifestation is not independant from Him. He realizes the material\nworld to be a perverted reflection of spiritual variegatedness and realizes that\nin everything there is a relationship with the Supreme Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Thus he\nthinks of everything in relation to V\u0101sudeva, or \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Such a universal\nvision of V\u0101sudeva precipitates one\u2019s full surrender to the Supreme Lord \u015ar\u012b\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the highest goal. Such surrendered great souls are very rare.\n\n\nThis verse is very nicely explained in the Third Chapter of \u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara\nUpani\u1e63ad: \u201cIn this body there are powers of speaking, of seeing, of hearing, of\nmental activities, etc. But these are not important if not related to the\nSupreme Lord. And because V\u0101sudeva is all-pervading and everything is V\u0101sudeva,\nthe devotee surrenders in full knowledge.\u201d (Cf. Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 7.17 and 11.40)\n\n\n7.20\n\n\nk\u0101mais tais tair h\u1e5bta-j\u00f1\u0101n\u0101\u1e25\n\n\nprapadyante \u2019nya-devat\u0101\u1e25\n\n\nta\u1e41 ta\u1e41 niyamam \u0101sth\u0101ya\n\n\nprak\u1e5bty\u0101 niyat\u0101\u1e25 svay\u0101\n\n\nkamai\u1e25\u2014by desires; tai\u1e25\u2014by those; tai\u1e25\u2014by those; h\u1e5bta\u2014distorted;\nj\u00f1\u0101n\u0101\u1e25\u2014knowledge; prapadyante\u2014surrender; anya\u2014other; devat\u0101\u1e25\u2014demigods; tam\u2014that;\ntam\u2014that; niyamam\u2014rules; \u0101sth\u0101ya\u2014following; prak\u1e5bty\u0101\u2014by nature;\nniyat\u0101\u1e25\u2014controlled; svay\u0101\u2014by their own.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThose whose minds are distorted by material desires surrender unto demigods and\nfollow the particular rules and regulations of worship according to their own\nnatures.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThose who are freed from all material contaminations surrender unto the Supreme\nLord and engage in His devotional service. As long as the material contamination\nis not completely washed off, they are by nature nondevotees. But even those who\nhave material desires and who resort to the Supreme Lord are not so much\nattracted by external nature; because of approaching the right goal, they soon\nbecome free from all material lust. In the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam it is recommended\nthat whether one is free from all material desires, or is full of material\ndesires, or desires liberation from material contamination, or is a pure devotee\nand has no desire for material sense gratification, he should in all cases\nsurrender to V\u0101sudeva and worship Him.\n\n\nIt is said in the Bh\u0101gavatam that less intelligent people who have lost their\nspiritual sense take shelter of demigods for immediate fulfillment of material\ndesires. Generally, such people do not go to the Supreme Personality of Godhead,\nbecause they are in particular modes of nature (ignorance and passion) and\ntherefore worship various demigods. Following the rules and regulations of\nworship, they are satisfied. The worshipers of demigods are motivated by small\ndesires and do not know how to reach the supreme goal, but a devotee of the\nSupreme Lord is not misguided. Because in Vedic literature there are\nrecommendations for worshiping different gods for different purposes (e.g., a\ndiseased man is recommended to worship the sun), those who are not devotees of\nthe Lord think that for certain purposes demigods are better than the Supreme\nLord. But a pure devotee knows that the Supreme Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the master of all.\nIn the Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta it is said that only the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is master and all others are servants. Therefore a pure devotee\nnever goes to demigods for satisfaction of his material needs. He depends on the\nSupreme Lord. And the pure devotee is satisfied with whatever He gives.\n\n\n7.21\n\n\nyo yo y\u0101\u1e41 y\u0101\u1e41 tanu\u1e41 bhakta\u1e25\n\n\n\u015braddhay\u0101rcitum icchati\n\n\ntasya tasy\u0101cal\u0101\u1e41 \u015braddh\u0101\u1e41\n\n\nt\u0101m eva vidadh\u0101my aham\n\n\nya\u1e25\u2014that; ya\u1e25\u2014that; y\u0101m\u2014which; y\u0101m\u2014which; tanum\u2014form of the demigods;\nbhakta\u1e25\u2014devotee; \u015braddhay\u0101\u2014with faith; arcitum\u2014to worship; icchati\u2014desires;\ntasya\u2014of that; tasya\u2014of that; acal\u0101m\u2014steady; \u015braddh\u0101m\u2014faith; tam\u2014him;\neva\u2014surely; vidadh\u0101mi\u2014give; aham\u2014I.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nI am in everyone\u2019s heart as the Supersoul. As soon as one desires to worship the\ndemigods, I make his faith steady so that he can devote himself to some\nparticular deity.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nGod has given independence to everyone; therefore, if a person desires to have\nmaterial enjoyment and wants very sincerely to have such facilities from the\nmaterial demigods, the Supreme Lord, as Supersoul in everyone\u2019s heart,\nunderstands and gives facilities to such persons. As the supreme father of all\nliving entities, He does not interfere with their independence, but gives all\nfacilities so that they can fulfill their material desires. Some may ask why the\nall-powerful God gives facilities to the living entities for enjoying this\nmaterial world and so lets them fall into the trap of the illusory energy. The\nanswer is that if the Supreme Lord as Supersoul does not give such facilities,\nthen there is no meaning to independence. Therefore He gives everyone full\nindependence\u2014whatever one likes\u2014but His ultimate instruction we find in the\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101: man should give up all other engagements and fully surrender unto\nHim. That will make man happy.\n\n\nBoth the living entity and the demigods are subordinate to the will of the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead; therefore the living entity cannot worship the\ndemigod by his own desire, nor can the demigod bestow any benediction without\nthe supreme will. As it is said, not a blade of grass moves without the will of\nthe Supreme Personality of Godhead. Generally, persons who are distressed in the\nmaterial world go to the demigods, as they are advised in the Vedic literature.\nA person wanting some particular thing may worship such and such a demigod. For\nexample, a diseased person is recommended to worship the sun-god; a person\nwanting education may worship the goddess of learning, Sarasvat\u012b; and a person\nwanting a beautiful wife may worship the goddess Um\u0101, the wife of Lord \u015aiva. In\nthis way there are recommendations in the \u015b\u0101stras (Vedic scriptures) for\ndifferent modes of worship of different demigods. And because a particular\nliving entity wants to enjoy a particular material facility, the Lord inspires\nhim with a strong desire to achieve that benediction from that particular\ndemigod, and so he successfully receives the benediction. The particular mode of\nthe devotional attitude of the living entity toward a particular type of demigod\nis also arranged by the Supreme Lord. The demigods cannot infuse the living\nentities with such an affinity, but because He is the Supreme Lord or the\nSupersoul who is present in the heart of all living entities, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a gives\nimpetus to man to worship certain demigods. The demigods are actually different\nparts of the universal body of the Supreme Lord; therefore they have no\nindependence. In the Vedic literature (Taittir\u012bya Upani\u1e63ad, First Anuv\u0101ka) it is\nstated: \u201cThe Supreme Personality of Godhead as Supersoul is also present within\nthe heart of the demigod; therefore He arranges through the demigod to fulfill\nthe desire of the living entity. But both the demigod and the living entity are\ndependant on the supreme wil1. They are not independant.\u201d\n\n\n7.22\n\n\nsa tay\u0101 \u015braddhay\u0101 yuktas\n\n\ntasy\u0101r\u0101dhanam \u012bhate\n\n\nlabhate ca tata\u1e25 k\u0101m\u0101n\n\n\nmayaiva vihit\u0101n hi t\u0101n\n\n\nsa\u1e25\u2014he; tay\u0101\u2014with that; \u015braddhay\u0101\u2014with faith; yukta\u1e25\u2014endowed; tasya\u2014his;\n\u0101r\u0101dhanam\u2014worship; \u012bhate\u2014seeks; labhate\u2014obtains; ca\u2014and; tata\u1e25\u2014from which;\nk\u0101m\u0101n\u2014desires; may\u0101\u2014by Me; eva\u2014alone; vihit\u0101n\u2014regulated; hi\u2014for; t\u0101n\u2014those.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nEndowed with such a faith, he seeks favors of a particular demigod and obtains\nhis desires. But in actuality these benefits are bestowed by Me alone.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe demigods cannot award benediction to the devotees without the permission of\nthe Supreme Lord. The living entity may forget that everything is the property\nof the Supreme Lord, but the demigods do not forget. So the worship of demigods\nand achievement of desired results are not due to the demigods but to the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead, by arrangement. The less intelligent living\nentity does not know this, and therefore he foolishly goes to the demigods for\nsome benefit. But the pure devotee, when in need of something, prays only to the\nSupreme Lord. Asking for material benefit, however, is not a sign of a pure\ndevotee. A living entity goes to the demigods usually because he is mad to\nfulfill his lust. This happens when something undue is desired by the living\nentity, and the Lord Himself does not fulfill the desire. In the\nCaitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta it is said that one who worships the Supreme Lord and at the\nsame time desires material enjoyment is contradictory in his desires. Devotional\nservice of the Supreme Lord and the worship of a demigod cannot be on the same\nplatform because worship of a demigod is material and devotional service to the\nSupreme Lord is completely spiritual.\n\n\nFor the living entity who desires to return to Godhead, material desires are\nimpediments. A pure devotee of the Lord is therefore not awarded the material\nbenefits desired by less intelligent living entities who prefer to worship\ndemigods of the material world rather than engage in devotional service of the\nSupreme Lord.\n\n\n7.23\n\n\nantavat tu phala\u1e41 te\u1e63\u0101\u1e41\n\n\ntad bhavaty alpa-medhas\u0101m\n\n\ndev\u0101n deva-yajo y\u0101nti\n\n\nmad-bhakt\u0101 y\u0101nti m\u0101m api\n\n\nantavat tu\u2014limited and temporary; phalam\u2014fruits; te\u1e63\u0101m\u2014their; tat\u2014that;\nbhavati\u2014becomes; alpa-medhas\u0101m\u2014of those of small intelligence; dev\u0101n\u2014demigods\u2019\nplanets; deva-yaja\u1e25\u2014worshipers of demigods; y\u0101nti\u2014achieve; mat\u2014My;\nbhakt\u0101\u1e25\u2014devotees; y\u0101nti\u2014attain; m\u0101m\u2014unto Me; api\u2014surely.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nMen of small intelligence worship the demigods, and their fruits are limited and\ntemporary. Those who worship the demigods go to the planets of the demigods, but\nMy devotees ultimately reach My supreme planet.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nSome commentators on the G\u012bt\u0101 say that one who worships a demigod can reach the\nSupreme Lord, but here it is clearly stated that the worshipers of demigods go\nto the different planetary systems where various demigods are situated, just as\na worshiper of the sun achieves the sun or a worshiper of the demigod of the\nmoon achieves the moon. Similarly, if anyone wants to worship a demigod like\nIndra, he can attain that particular god\u2019s planet. It is not that everyone,\nregardless of whatever demigod is worshiped, will reach the Supreme Personality\nof Godhead. That is denied here, for it is clearly stated that the worshipers of\ndemigods go to different planets in the material world, but the devotee of the\nSupreme Lord goes directly to the supreme planet of the Personality of Godhead.\n\n\nHere the point may be raised that if the demigods are different parts of the\nbody of the Supreme Lord, then the same end should be achieved by worshiping\nthem. However, worshipers of the demigods are less intelligent because they\ndon\u2019t know to what part of the body food must be supplied. Some of them are so\nfoolish that they claim that there are many parts and many ways to supply food.\nThis isn\u2019t very sanguine. Can anyone supply food to the body through the ears or\neyes? They do not know that these demigods are different parts of the universal\nbody of the Supreme Lord, and in their ignorance they believe that each and\nevery demigod is a separate God and a competitor of the Supreme Lord.\n\n\nNot only are demigods parts of the Supreme Lord, but ordinary living entities\nare also. In the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam it is stated that the br\u0101hma\u1e47as are the head\nof the Supreme Lord, the k\u1e63atriyas are the arms, etc., and that all serve\ndifferent functions. Regardless of the situation, if one knows that both the\ndemigods and himself are part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, his knowledge is\nperfect. But if he does not understand this, he achieves different planets where\nthe demigods reside. This is not the same destination the devotee reaches.\n\n\nThe results achieved by the demigods\u2019 benedictions are perishable because within\nthis material world the planets, the demigods and their worshipers are all\nperishable. Therefore it is clearly stated in this verse that all results\nachieved by worshiping demigods are perishable, and therefore such worship is\nperformed by the less intelligent living entity. Because the pure devotee\nengaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness in devotional service of the Supreme Lord\nachieves eternal blissful existence that is full of knowledge, his achievements\nand those of the common worshiper of the demigods are different. The Supreme\nLord is unlimited; His favor is unlimited; His mercy is unlimited. Therefore the\nmercy of the Supreme Lord upon His pure devotees is unlimited.\n\n\n7.24\n\n\navyakta\u1e41 vyaktim \u0101panna\u1e41\n\n\nmanyante m\u0101m abuddhaya\u1e25\n\n\npara\u1e41 bh\u0101vam aj\u0101nanto\n\n\nmam\u0101vyayam anuttamam\n\n\navyaktam\u2014nonmanifested; vyaktim\u2014personality; \u0101pannam\u2014achieved; manyante\u2014think;\nm\u0101m\u2014unto Me; abuddhaya\u1e25\u2014less intelligent persons; param\u2014supreme; bh\u0101vam\u2014state of\nbeing; aj\u0101nanta\u1e25\u2014without knowing; mama\u2014My; avyayam\u2014imperishable; anuttamam\u2014the\nfinest.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nUnintelligent men, who know Me not, think that I have assumed this form and\npersonality. Due to their small knowledge, they do not know My higher nature,\nwhich is changeless and supreme.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThose who are worshipers of demigods have been described as less intelligent\npersons, and here the impersonalists are similarly described. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in His\npersonal form is here speaking before Arjuna, and still, due to ignorance,\nimpersonalists argue that the Supreme Lord ultimately has no form. Y\u0101mun\u0101c\u0101rya,\na great devotee of the Lord in the disciplic succession from R\u0101m\u0101nuj\u0101c\u0101rya, has\nwritten two very appropriate verses in this connection. He says, \u201cMy dear Lord,\ndevotees like Vy\u0101sadeva and N\u0101rada know You to be the Personality of Godhead. By\nunderstanding different Vedic literatures, one can come to know Your\ncharacteristics, Your form and Your activities, and one can thus understand that\nYou are the Supreme Personality of Godhead. But those who are in the modes of\npassion and ignorance, the demons, the nondevotees, cannot understand You. They\nare unable to understand You. However expert such nondevotees may be in\ndiscussing Ved\u0101nta and the Upani\u1e63ads and other Vedic literatures, it is not\npossible for them to understand the Personality of Godhead.\u201d\n\n\nIn the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 it is stated that the Personality of Godhead cannot be\nunderstood simply by study of the Ved\u0101nta literature. Only by the mercy of the\nSupreme Lord can the Personality of the Supreme be known. Therefore in this\nverse it is clearly stated that not only the worshipers of the demigods are less\nintelligent, but those nondevotees who are engaged in Ved\u0101nta and speculation on\nVedic literature without any tinge of true K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness are also less\nintelligent, and for them it is not possible to understand God\u2019s personal\nnature. Persons who are under the impression that the Absolute Truth is\nimpersonal are described as asuras, which means one who does not know the\nultimate feature of the Absolute Truth. In the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam it is stated\nthat supreme realization begins from the impersonal Brahman and then rises to\nthe localized Supersoul\u2014but the ultimate word in the Absolute Truth is the\nPersonality of Godhead. Modern impersonalists are still less intelligent, for\nthey do not even follow their great predecessor, \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101c\u0101rya, who has\nspecifically stated that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\nImpersonalists, therefore, not knowing the Supreme Truth, think K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to be only\nthe son of Devak\u012b and Vasudeva, or a prince, or a powerful living entity. This\nis also condemned in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101: \u201cOnly the fools regard Me as an ordinary\nperson.\u201d The fact is that no one can understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a without rendering\ndevotional service and without developing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. The G\u012bt\u0101 confirms\nthis.\n\n\nOne cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or His form,\nquality or name simply by mental speculation or by discussing Vedic literature.\nOne must understand Him by devotional service. When one is fully engaged in\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, beginning by chanting the mah\u0101mantra\u2014Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare\u2014then\nonly can one understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Nondevotee\nimpersonalists think that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has a body made of this material nature and that\nall His activities, His form and everything, are m\u0101y\u0101. These impersonalists are\nknown as M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b. They do not know the ultimate truth.\n\n\nThe twentieth verse clearly states: \u201cThose who are blinded by lusty desires\nsurrender unto the different demigods.\u201d It is accepted that besides the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead, there are demigods who have their different planets (### .\n7.23), and the Lord also has a planet. It is also stated that the worshipers of\nthe demigods go to the different planets of the demigods, and those who are\ndevotees of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a go to the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aloka planet. Although this is clearly\nstated, the foolish impersonalists still maintain that the Lord is formless and\nthat these forms are impositions. From the study of the G\u012bt\u0101 does it appear that\nthe demigods and their abodes are impersonal? Clearly, neither the demigods nor\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, are impersonal. They are all persons;\nLord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and He has His own planet, and\nthe demigods have theirs.\n\n\nTherefore the monistic contention that ultimate truth is formless and that form\nis imposed does not hold true. It is clearly stated here that it is not imposed.\nFrom the G\u012bt\u0101 we can clearly understand that the forms of the demigods and the\nform of the Supreme Lord are simultaneously existing and that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is\nsac-cid-\u0101nanda, eternal blissful knowledge. The Vedas also confirm that the\nSupreme Absolute Truth is \u0101nandamaya, or full of blissful pleasure, and that He\nis abhy\u0101s\u0101t, by nature the reservoir of unlimited auspicious qualities. And in\nthe G\u012bt\u0101 the Lord says that although He is aja (unborn), He still appears. These\nare the facts that we should understand from the G\u012bt\u0101. We cannot understand how\nthe Supreme Personality of Godhead can be impersonal; the imposition theory of\nthe impersonalist monist is false as far as the statements of the G\u012bt\u0101 are\nconcerned. It is clear herein that the Supreme Absolute Truth, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, has\nboth form and personality.\n\n\n7.25\n\n\nn\u0101ha\u1e41 prak\u0101\u015ba\u1e25 sarvasya\n\n\nyoga-m\u0101y\u0101-sam\u0101v\u1e5bta\u1e25\n\n\nm\u016b\u1e0dho \u2019ya\u1e41 n\u0101bhij\u0101n\u0101ti\n\n\nloko m\u0101m ajam avyayam\n\n\nna\u2014nor; aham\u2014I; prak\u0101\u015ba\u1e25\u2014manifest; sarvasya\u2014to everyone; yoga-m\u0101y\u0101\u2014internal\npotency; sam\u0101v\u1e5bta\u1e25\u2014covered; m\u016b\u1e0dha\u1e25\u2014foolish; ayam\u2014this; na\u2014not; abhij\u0101n\u0101ti\u2014can\nunderstand; loka\u1e25\u2014such less intelligent persons; m\u0101m\u2014Me; ajam\u2014unborn;\navyayam\u2014inexhaustible.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nI am never manifest to the foolish and unintelligent.

But actually He was not\nmanifest to everyone. When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was present there were only a few people who\ncould understand Him to be the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the assembly\nof Kurus, when \u015ai\u015bup\u0101la spoke against K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a being elected president of the\nassembly, Bh\u012b\u1e63ma supported Him and proclaimed Him to be the Supreme God.\nSimilarly, the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas and a few others knew that He was the Supreme, but not\neveryone. He was not revealed to the nondevotees and the common man. Therefore\nin the G\u012bt\u0101 K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says that but for His pure devotees, all men consider Him to\nbe like themselves. He was manifest only to His devotees as the reservoir of all\npleasure. But to others, to unintelligent nondevotees, He was covered by His\neternal potency.\n\n\nIn the prayers of Kunt\u012b in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (1.8.18), it is said that the\nLord is covered by the curtain of yoga-m\u0101y\u0101 and thus ordinary people cannot\nunderstand Him. Kunt\u012b prays: \u201cO my Lord, You are the maintainer of the entire\nuniverse, and devotional service to You is the highest religious principle.\nTherefore, I pray that You will also maintain me. Your transcendental form is\ncovered by the yoga-m\u0101y\u0101. The brahmajyoti is the covering of the internal\npotency. May You kindly remove this glowing effulgence that impedes my seeing\nYour sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha, Your eternal form of bliss and knowledge.\u201d\n\n\nThis yoga-m\u0101y\u0101 curtain is also mentioned in the Fifteenth Chapter of the G\u012bt\u0101.\nThe Supreme Personality of Godhead in His transcendental form of bliss and\nknowledge is covered by the eternal potency of brahmajyoti and the less\nintelligent impersonalists cannot see the Supreme on this account. Also in the\n\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (10.14.7) there is this prayer by Brahm\u0101: \u201cO Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead, O Supersoul, O master of all mystery, who can calculate\nYour potency and pastimes in this world? You are always expanding Your eternal\npotency, and therefore no one can understand You. Learned scientists and learned\nscholars can examine the atomic constitution of the material world or even the\nplanets, but still they are unable to calculate Your energy and potency,\nalthough You are present before them.\u201d The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is not only unborn, but He is avyaya, inexhaustible. His eternal form is\nbliss and knowledge, and His energies are all inexhaustible.\n\n\n7.26\n\n\nved\u0101ha\u1e41 samat\u012bt\u0101ni\n\n\nvartam\u0101n\u0101ni c\u0101rjuna\n\n\nbhavi\u1e63y\u0101\u1e47i ca bh\u016bt\u0101ni\n\n\nm\u0101\u1e41 tu veda na ka\u015bcana\n\n\nveda\u2014know; aham\u2014I; sama\u2014equally; at\u012bt\u0101ni\u2014past; vartam\u0101n\u0101ni\u2014present; ca\u2014and;\narjuna\u2014O Arjuna; bhavi\u1e63y\u0101\u1e47i\u2014future; ca\u2014also; bh\u016bt\u0101ni\u2014living entities; m\u0101m\u2014Me;\ntu\u2014but; veda\u2014knows; na\u2014not; ka\u015bcana\u2014anyone.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nO Arjuna, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, I know everything that has\nhappened in the past, all that is happening in the present, and all things that\nare yet to come. I also know all living entities; but Me no one knows.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nHere the question of personality and impersonality is clearly stated. If K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a,\nthe form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is considered by the\nimpersonalists to be m\u0101y\u0101, to be material, then He would, like the living\nentity, change His body and forget everything in His past life. Anyone with a\nmaterial body cannot remember his past life, nor can he foretell his future\nlife, nor can he predict the outcome of his present life; therefore he cannot\nknow what is happening in past, present and future. Unless one is liberated from\nmaterial contamination, he cannot know past, present and future.\nUnlike the ordinary human being, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a clearly says that He completely\nknows what happened in the past, what is happening in the present, and what will\nhappen in the future. In the Fourth Chapter we have seen that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nremembers instructing Vivasv\u0101n, the sun-god, millions of years ago. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a knows\nevery living entity because He is situated in every living being\u2019s heart as the\nSupreme Soul. But despite His presence in every living entity as Supersoul and\nHis presence beyond the material sky, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the\nless intelligent cannot realize Him as the Supreme Person. Certainly the\ntranscendental body of \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not perishable. He is just like the sun, and\nmay\u0101 is like the cloud. In the material world we can see that there is the sun\nand that there are clouds and different stars and planets. The clouds may cover\nall these in the sky temporarily, but this covering is only apparent to our\nlimited vision. The sun, moon and stars are not actually covered. Similarly,\nm\u0101y\u0101 cannot cover the Supreme Lord. By His internal potency He is not manifest\nto the less intelligent class of men. As it is stated in the third verse of this\nchapter, out of millions and millions of men, some try to become perfect in this\nhuman form of life, and out of thousands and thousands of such perfected men,\nhardly one can understand what Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is. Even if one is perfected by\nrealization of impersonal Brahman or localized Param\u0101tm\u0101, he cannot possibly\nunderstand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, without being in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness.\n\n\n7.27\n\n\nicch\u0101-dve\u1e63a-samutthena\n\n\ndvandva-mohena bh\u0101rata\n\n\nsarva-bh\u016bt\u0101ni sammoha\u1e41\n\n\nsarge y\u0101nti parantapa\n\n\nicch\u0101\u2014desire; dve\u1e63a\u2014hate; samutthena\u2014born; dvandva\u2014duality; mohena\u2014overcome;\nbh\u0101rata\u2014O scion of Bharata; sarva\u2014all; bh\u016bt\u0101ni\u2014living entities; sammoham\u2014into\ndelusion; sarge\u2014in creation; y\u0101nti\u2014go; parantapa\u2014O conquerer of enemies.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nO scion of Bharata [Arjuna], O conquerer of the foe, all living entities are\nborn into delusion, overcome by the dualities of desire and hate.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe real constitutional position of the living entity is that of subordination\nto the Supreme Lord, who is pure knowledge. When one is deluded into separation\nfrom this pure knowledge, he becomes controlled by illusory energy and cannot\nunderstand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The illusory energy is manifested\nin the duality of desire and hate. Due to desire and hate, the ignorant person\nwants to become one with the Supreme Lord and envies K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead. Pure devotees, who are not so deluded or contaminated by\ndesire and hate, can understand that Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a appears by His internal\npotencies, but those who are deluded by duality and nescience think that the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead is created by material energies. This is their\nmisfortune. Such deluded persons, symptomatically, dwell in dualities of\ndishonor and honor, misery and happiness, woman and man, good and bad, pleasure\nand pain, etc., thinking, \u201cThis is my wife; this is my house; I am the master of\nthis house; I am the husband of this wife.\u201d These are the dualities of delusion.\nThose who are so deluded by dualities are completely foolish and therefore\ncannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\n\n\n7.28\n\n\nye\u1e63\u0101\u1e41 tv anta-gata\u1e41 p\u0101pa\u1e41\n\n\njan\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 pu\u1e47ya-karma\u1e47\u0101m\n\n\nte dvandva-moha-nirmukt\u0101\n\n\nbhajante m\u0101\u1e41 d\u1e5b\u1e0dha-vrat\u0101\u1e25\n\n\nye\u1e63\u0101m\u2014whose; tu\u2014but; anta-gatam\u2014completely eradicated; p\u0101pam\u2014sin; jan\u0101n\u0101m\u2014of the\npersons; pu\u1e47ya\u2014pious; karma\u1e47\u0101m\u2014previous activities; te\u2014they; dvandva\u2014duality;\nmoha\u2014delusion; nirmukt\u0101\u1e25\u2014free from; bhajante\u2014worship; m\u0101m\u2014Me; d\u1e5b\u1e0dha-vrat\u0101\u1e25\u2014with\ndetermination.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nPersons who have acted piously in previous lives and in this life, whose sinful\nactions are completely eradicated and who are freed from the duality of\ndelusion, engage themselves in My service with determination.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThose eligible for elevation to the transcendental position are mentioned in\nthis verse. For those who are sinful, atheistic, foolish and deceitful, it is\nvery difficult to transcend the duality of desire and hate. Only those who have\npassed their lives in practicing the regulative principles of religion, who have\nacted piously and have conquered sinful reactions can accept devotional service\nand gradually rise to the pure knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\nThen, gradually, they can meditate in trance on the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead. That is the process of being situated on the spiritual platform. This\nelevation is possible in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness in the association of pure devotees\nwho can deliver one from delusion.\n\n\nIt is stated in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam that if one actually wants to be liberated\nhe must render service to the devotees; but one who associates with\nmaterialistic people is on the path leading to the darkest region of existence.\nAll the devotees of the Lord traverse this earth just to recover the conditioned\nsouls from their delusion. The impersonalists do not know that forgetting their\nconstitutional position as subordinate to the Supreme Lord is the greatest\nviolation of God\u2019s law. Unless one is reinstated in his own constitutional\nposition, it is not possible to understand the Supreme Personality or to be\nfully engaged in His transcendental loving service with determination.\n\n\n7.29\n\n\njar\u0101-mara\u1e47a-mok\u1e63\u0101ya\n\n\nm\u0101m \u0101\u015britya yatanti ye\n\n\nte brahma tad vidu\u1e25 k\u1e5btsnam\n\n\nadhy\u0101tma\u1e41 karma c\u0101khilam\n\n\njar\u0101\u2014old age; mara\u1e47a\u2014death; mok\u1e63\u0101ya\u2014for the purpose of liberation; m\u0101m\u2014unto Me;\n\u0101\u015britya\u2014taking shelter of; yatanti\u2014endeavor; ye\u2014all those; te\u2014such persons;\nbrahma\u2014Brahman; tat\u2014actually that; vidu\u1e25\u2014they know; k\u1e5btsnam\u2014everything;\nadhy\u0101tmam\u2014transcendental; karma\u2014fruitive activities; ca\u2014also; akhilam\u2014entirely.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nIntelligent persons who are endeavoring for liberation from old age and death\ntake refuge in Me in devotional service. They are actually Brahman because they\nentirely know everything about transcendental and fruitive activities.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nBirth, death, old age and diseases affect this material body, but not the\nspiritual body. There is no birth, death, old age and disease for the spiritual\nbody, so one who attains a spiritual body, becomes one of the associates of the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead and engages in eternal devotional service, is\nreally liberated. Aha\u1e41 brahm\u0101smi: I am spirit. It is said that one should\nunderstand that he is Brahman\u2014spirit soul. This Brahman conception of life is\nalso in devotional service, as described in this verse. The pure devotees are\ntranscendentally situated on the Brahman platform, and they know everything\nabout transcendental and material activities.\n\n\nFour kinds of impure devotees who engage themselves in the transcendental\nservice of the Lord achieve their respective goals, and by the grace of the\nSupreme Lord, when they are fully K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, they actually enjoy spiritual\nassociation with the Supreme Lord. But those who are worshipers of demigods\nnever reach the Supreme Lord in His supreme planet. Even the less intelligent\nBrahman-realized persons cannot reach the supreme planet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a known as\nGoloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. Only persons who perform activities in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness\n(m\u0101m \u0101\u015britya) are actually entitled to be called Brahman, because they are\nactually endeavoring to reach the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a planet. Such persons have no misgivings\nabout K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and thus they are factually Brahman.\n\n\nThose who are engaged in worshiping the form or arc\u0101 of the Lord or who are\nengaged in meditation on the Lord simply for liberation from material bondage,\nalso know, by the grace of the Lord, the purports of Brahman, adhibh\u016bta, etc.,\nas explained by the Lord in the next chapter.\n\n\n7.30\n\n\ns\u0101dhibh\u016bt\u0101dhidaiva\u1e41 m\u0101\u1e41\n\n\ns\u0101dhiyaj\u00f1a\u1e41 ca ye vidu\u1e25\n\n\npray\u0101\u1e47a-k\u0101le \u2019pi ca m\u0101\u1e41\n\n\nte vidur yukta-cetasa\u1e25\n\n\nsa-adhibh\u016bta\u2014the governing principle of the material manifestation;\nadhidaivam\u2014underlying all the demigods; m\u0101m\u2014Me; sa-adhiyaj\u00f1am\u2014sustaining all\nsacrifices; ca\u2014and; ye\u2014those; vidu\u1e25\u2014know; pray\u0101\u1e47a\u2014of death; k\u0101le\u2014at the time;\napi\u2014even; ca\u2014and; m\u0101m\u2014Me; te\u2014they; vidu\u1e25\u2014know; yukta-cetasa\u1e25\u2014with steadfast\nmind.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThose who know Me as the Supreme Lord, as the governing principle of the\nmaterial manifestation, who know Me as the one underlying all the demigods and\nas the one sustaining all sacrifices, can, with steadfast mind, understand and\nknow Me even at the time of death.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nPersons acting in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness are never entirely deviated from the path\nof understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the transcendental\nassociation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, one can understand how the Supreme Lord is\nthe governing principle of the material manifestation and even of the demigods.\nGradually, by such transcendental association, one becomes convinced of the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead Himself, and at the time of death such a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconscious person can never forget K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Naturally he is thus promoted to the\nplanet of the Supreme Lord, Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana.\n\n\nThis Seventh Chapter particularly explains how one can become a fully K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconscious person. The beginning of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is association of persons\nwho are K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious. Such association is spiritual and puts one directly in\ntouch with the Supreme Lord, and, by His grace, one can understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to be\nthe Supreme God. At the same time one can really understand the constitutional\nposition of the living entity and how the living entity forgets K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and\nbecomes entangled in material activities. By gradual development of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness in good association, the living entity can understand that due to\nforgetfulness of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a he has become conditioned by the laws of material nature.\nHe can also understand that this human form of life is an opportunity to regain\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and that it should be fully utilized to attain the causeless\nmercy of the Supreme Lord.\n\n\nMany subjects have been discussed in this chapter: the man in distress, the\ninquisitive man, the man in want of material necessities, knowledge of Brahman,\nknowledge of Param\u0101tm\u0101, liberation from birth, death and diseases, and worship\nof the Supreme Lord. However, he who is actually elevated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness\ndoes not care for the different processes. He simply directly engages himself in\nactivities of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and thereby factually attains his\nconstitutional position as eternal servitor of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In such a situation\nhe takes pleasure in hearing and glorifying the Supreme Lord in pure devotional\nservice. He is convinced that by doing so, all his objectives will be fulfilled.\nThis determined faith is called d\u1e5b\u1e0dha-vrata, and it is the beginning of\nbhakti-yoga or transcendental loving service. That is the verdict of all\nscriptures. This Seventh Chapter of the G\u012bt\u0101 is the substance of that\nconviction.",

TRANSLATION  Now hear, O son of P\u1e5bth\u0101 [Arjuna], how by practicing yoga in full consciousness\nof Me, with mind attached to Me, you can know Me in full, free from doubt.  PURPORT  In this Seventh Chapter of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, the nature of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is\nfully described. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is full in all opulences, and how He manifests such\nopulences is described herein. Also, four kinds of fortunate people who become\nattached to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and four kinds of unfortunate people who never take to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nare described in this chapter.  In the first six chapters of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, the living entity has been described\nas nonmaterial spirit soul which is capable of elevating himself to\nself-realization by different types of yogas. At the end of the Sixth Chapter,\nit has been clearly stated that the steady concentration of the mind upon K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a,\nor in other words K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, is the highest form of all yoga. By\nconcentrating one\u2019s mind upon K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one is able to know the Absolute Truth\ncompletely, but not otherwise. Impersonal brahmajyoti or localized Param\u0101tm\u0101\nrealization is not perfect knowledge of the Absolute Truth because it is\npartial. Full and scientific knowledge is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and everything is revealed to\nthe person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. In complete K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness one knows\nthat K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is ultimate knowledge beyond any doubts. Different types of yoga are\nonly steppingstones on the path of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. One who takes directly\nto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness automatically knows about brahmajyoti and Param\u0101tm\u0101 in\nfull. By practice of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness yoga, one can know everything in\nfull\u2014namely the Absolute Truth, the living entities, the material nature, and\ntheir manifestations with paraphernalia.  One should therefore begin yoga practice as directed in the last verse of the\nSixth Chapter. Concentration of the mind upon K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a the Supreme is made possible\nby prescribed devotional service in nine different forms, of which \u015brava\u1e47am is\nthe first and most important. The Lord therefore says to Arjuna, \u201ctat \u015b\u1e5b\u1e47u,\u201d or\n\u201cHear from Me.\u201d No one can be a greater authority than K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and therefore by\nhearing from Him one receives the greatest opportunity for progress in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness. One has therefore to learn from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a directly or from a pure\ndevotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2014and not from a nondevotee upstart, puffed up with academic\neducation.  In the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam this process of understanding K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth, is described in the Second Chapter\nof the First Canto as follows:  \u015b\u1e5b\u1e47vat\u0101\u1e41 sva-kath\u0101\u1e41 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u1e25 pu\u1e47ya-\u015brava\u1e47a-k\u012brtana\u1e25 h\u1e5bdyanta\u1e25stho hy abhadr\u0101\u1e47i\nvidbunoti suh\u1e5bt sat\u0101m.  na\u1e63\u1e6da-pr\u0101ye\u1e63v abhadre\u1e63u nitya\u1e41 bh\u0101gavata-sevay\u0101 bhagavaty uttama-\u015bloke bhaktir\nbhavati nai\u1e63\u1e6dhik\u012b.  tad\u0101 rajas-tamo-bh\u0101v\u0101\u1e25 k\u0101ma-lobhadaya\u015b ca ye ceta etair an\u0101viddha\u1e41 sthita\u1e41\nsattve pras\u012bdati.  evam prasanna-manaso bhagavad-bhakti-yogata\u1e25 bhagavat-tattva-vij\u00f1\u0101na\u1e41\nmukta-sa\u1e45gasya j\u0101yate.  bhidyate h\u1e5bdaya-granthi\u015b chidyante sarva-sa\u1e41\u015bay\u0101\u1e25 k\u1e63\u012byante c\u0101sya karm\u0101\u1e47i d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da\nev\u0101tman\u012b\u015bvare.  \u201cTo hear about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a from Vedic literatures, or to hear from Him directly\nthrough the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, is itself righteous activity. And for one who hears\nabout K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who is dwelling in everyone\u2019s heart, acts as a\nbest-wishing friend and purifies the devotee who constantly engages in hearing\nof Him. In this way, a devotee naturally develops his dormant transcendental\nknowledge. As he hears more about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a from the Bh\u0101gavatam and from the\ndevotees, he becomes fixed in the devotional service of the Lord. By development\nof devotional service one becomes freed from the modes of passion and ignorance,\nand thus material lusts and avarice are diminished. When these impurities are\nwiped away, the candidate remains steady in his position of pure goodness,\nbecomes enlivened by devotional service and understands the science of God\nperfectly. Thus bhakti-yoga severs the hard knot of material affection and\nenables one to come at once to the stage of \u2018asa\u1e41\u015baya\u1e41 samagram,\u2019 understanding\nof the Supreme Absolute Truth Personality of Godhead.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 1.2.17\u201321)  Therefore only by hearing from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or from His devotee in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness\ncan one understand the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",

TRANSLATION  Out of many thousands among men, one may endeavor for perfection, and of those\nwho have achieved perfection, hardly one knows Me in truth.  PURPORT  There are various grades of men, and out of many thousands one may be\nsufficiently interested in transcendental realization to try to know what is the\nself, what is the body, and what is the Absolute Truth. Generally mankind is\nsimply engaged in the animal propensities, namely eating, sleeping, defending\nand mating, and hardly anyone is interested in transcendental knowledge. The\nfirst six chapters of the G\u012bt\u0101 are meant for those who are interested in\ntranscendental knowledge, in understanding the self, the Superself and the\nprocess of realization by j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga, dhy\u0101na-yoga, and discrimination of the\nself from matter. However, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can only be known by persons who are in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness. Other transcendentalists may achieve impersonal Brahman\nrealization, for this is easier than understanding K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme\nPerson, but at the same time He is beyond the knowledge of Brahman and\nParam\u0101tm\u0101. The yog\u012bs and j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs are confused in their attempts to understand\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, although the greatest of the impersonalists, \u015ar\u012bp\u0101da \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101c\u0101rya, has\nadmitted in his G\u012bt\u0101 commentary that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead. But his followers do not accept K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as such, for it is very difficult\nto know K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, even though one has transcendental realization of impersonal\nBrahman.  K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the cause of all causes, the\nprimeval Lord Govinda. \u012a\u015bvara\u1e25 parama\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u1e25 sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha\u1e25 an\u0101dir\n\u0101dir govinda\u1e25 sarva-k\u0101ra\u1e47a-k\u0101ra\u1e47am. It is very difficult for the nondevotees to\nknow Him. Although nondevotees declare that the path of bhakti or devotional\nservice is very easy, they cannot practice it. If the path of bhakti is so easy,\nas the nondevotee class of men proclaim, then why do they take up the difficult\npath? Actually the path of bhakti is not easy. The so-called path of bhakti\npracticed by unauthorized persons without knowledge of bhakti may be easy, but\nwhen it is practiced factually according to the rules and regulations, the\nspeculative scholars and philosophers fall away from the path. \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa\nGosv\u0101m\u012b writes in his Bhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu:  \u015bruti-sm\u1e5bti-pur\u0101\u1e47\u0101di-pa\u00f1car\u0101tra-vidhi\u1e41 vin\u0101 aik\u0101ntik\u012b harer bhaktir utp\u0101t\u0101yaiva\nkalpate.  \u201cDevotional service of the Lord that ignores the authorized Vedic literatures\nlike the Upani\u1e63ads, Pur\u0101\u1e47as, N\u0101rada-pa\u00f1car\u0101tra, etc., is simply an unnecessary\ndisturbance in society.\u201d  It is not possible for the Brahman realized impersonalist or the Param\u0101tm\u0101\nrealized yog\u012b to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a the Supreme Personality of Godhead as the son\nof mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 or the charioteer of Arjuna. Even the great demigods are\nsometimes confused about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a: \u201cmuhyanti yat s\u016braya\u1e25,\u201d \u201cm\u0101\u1e41 tu veda na\nka\u015bcana.\u201d \u201cNo one knows Me as I am,\u201d the Lord says. And if one does know Him,\nthen \u201csa mah\u0101tm\u0101 sudurlabha\u1e25.\u201d \u201cSuch a great soul is very rare.\u201d Therefore\nunless one practices devotional service to the Lord, he cannot know K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as He\nis (tattvata\u1e25), even though one is a great scholar or philosopher. Only the pure\ndevotees can know something of the inconceivable transcendental qualities in\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, in the cause of all causes, in His omnipotence and opulence, and in His\nwealth, fame, strength, beauty, knowledge and renunciation, because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is\nbenevolently inclined to His devotees. He is the last word in Brahman\nrealization, and the devotees alone can realize Him as He is. Therefore it is\nsaid:  ata\u1e25 \u015br\u012b-k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-n\u0101m\u0101di na bhaved gr\u0101hyam indriy\u0101i\u1e25 sevonmukhe hi jihv\u0101dau svayam\neva sphuraty ada\u1e25  \u201cNo one can understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as He is by the blunt material senses.

PURPORT  The science of God analyzes the constitutional position of God and His diverse\nenergies. Material nature is called prak\u1e5bti, or the energy of the Lord in His\ndifferent puru\u1e63a incarnations (expansions) as described in the Svatvata Tantra:  vi\u1e63\u1e47os tu tr\u012b\u1e47i r\u016bp\u0101\u1e47i puru\u1e63\u0101khy\u0101ny atho vidu\u1e25 ekantu mahata\u1e25 sra\u1e63\u1e6d\u1e5b dvit\u012bya\u1e41 tv\na\u1e47\u1e0da-sa\u1e41sthitam t\u1e5bt\u012bya\u1e41 sarvabh\u016bta-stha\u1e41 t\u0101ni j\u00f1\u0101tv\u0101 vimucyate  \u201cFor material creation, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s plenary expansion assumes three Vi\u1e63\u1e47us. The\nfirst one, Mah\u0101-Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, creates the total material energy, known as mahat-tattva.\nThe second, Garbhodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, enters into all the universes to create\ndiversities in each of them. The third, K\u1e63\u012brodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, is diffused as the\nall-pervading Supersoul in all the universes and is known as Param\u0101tm\u0101, who is\npresent even within the atoms. Anyone who knows these three Vi\u1e63\u1e47us can be\nliberated from material entanglement.\u201d  This material world is a temporary manifestation of one of the energies of the\nLord. All the activities of the material world are directed by these three Vi\u1e63\u1e47u\nexpansions of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. These Puru\u1e63as are called incarnations. Generally one\nwho does not know the science of God (K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a) assumes that this material world is\nfor the enjoyment of the living entities and that the living entities are the\ncauses (Puru\u1e63as), controllers and enjoyers of the material energy. According to\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 this atheistic conclusion is false. In the verse under discussion\nit is stated that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the original cause of the material manifestation.\n\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam also confirms this. The ingredients of the material\nmanifestation are separated energies of the Lord. Even the brahmajyoti, which is\nthe ultimate goal of the impersonalists, is a spiritual energy manifested in the\nspiritual sky. There are no spiritual diversities in brahmajyoti as there are in\nthe Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhalokas, and the impersonalist accepts this brahmajyoti as the\nultimate eternal goal. The Param\u0101tm\u0101 manifestation is also a temporary\nall-pervasive aspect of the K\u1e63\u012brodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. The Param\u0101tm\u0101 manifestation is\nnot eternal in the spiritual world. Therefore the factual Absolute Truth is the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He is the complete energetic person, and\nHe possesses different separated and internal energies.  In the material energy, the principal manifestations are eight, as above\nmentioned. Out of these, the first five manifestations, namely earth, water,\nfire, air and sky, are called the five gigantic creations or the gross\ncreations, within which the five sense objects are included. They are the\nmanifestations of physical sound, touch, form, taste and smell. Material science\ncomprises these ten items and nothing more. But the other three items, namely\nmind, intelligence and false ego, are neglected by the materialists.\nPhilosophers who deal with mental activities are also not perfect in knowledge\nbecause they do not know the ultimate source, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The false ego\u2014\u201cI am,\u201d and\n\u201cIt is mine,\u201d which constitute the basic principle of material\nexistence\u2014includes ten sense organs for material activities. Intelligence refers\nto the total material creation, called the mahat-tattva. Therefore from the\neight separated energies of the Lord are manifest the twenty-four elements of\nthe material world, which are the subject matter of s\u0101\u1e45khya atheistic\nphilosophy; they are originally offshoots from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s energies and are\nseparated from Him, but atheistic s\u0101\u1e45khya philosophers with a poor fund of\nknowledge do not know K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the cause of all causes. The subject matter for\ndiscussion in the s\u0101\u1e45khya philosophy is only the manifestation of the external\nenergy of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, as it is described in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.",

TRANSLATION  Besides this inferior nature, O mighty-armed Arjuna, there is a superior energy\nof Mine, which are all living entities who are struggling with material nature\nand are sustaining the universe.  PURPORT  Here it is clearly mentioned that living entities belong to the superior nature\n(or energy) of the Supreme Lord. The inferior energy is matter manifested in\ndifferent elements, namely earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence\nand false ego. Both forms of material nature, namely gross (earth, etc.) and\nsubtle (mind, etc.), are products of the inferior energy. The living entities,\nwho are exploiting these inferior energies for different purposes, are the\nsuperior energy of the Supreme Lord, and it is due to this energy that the\nentire material world functions. The cosmic manifestation has no power to act\nunless it is moved by the superior energy, the living entity. Energies are\nalways controlled by the energetic, and therefore living entities are always\ncontrolled by the Lord\u2014they have no independant existence. They are never\nequally powerful, as unintelligent men think. The distinction between the living\nentities and the Lord is described in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam as follows (10.87.30):  aparimit\u0101 dhruv\u0101s tanubh\u1e5bto yadi sarva-gat\u0101s tarhi\u1e41 na \u015b\u0101syateti niyamo dhruva\nnetarath\u0101 ajani ca yanmaya\u1e41 tad avimucya niyant\u1e5b bhavet samam anuj\u0101nat\u0101\u1e41\nyad-amata\u1e41 mata-du\u1e63\u1e6datay\u0101  \u201cO Supreme Eternal! If the embodied living entities were eternal and\nall-pervading like You, then they would not be under Your control. But if the\nliving entities are accepted as minute energies of Your Lordship, then they are\nat once subject to Your supreme control. Therefore real liberation entails\nsurrender by the living entities to Your control, and that surrender will make\nthem happy. In that constitutional position only can they be controllers.\nTherefore, men with limited knowledge who advocate the monistic theory that God\nand the living entities are equal in all respects are actually misleading\nthemselves and others.\u201d  The Supreme Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the only controller, and all living entities are\ncontrolled by Him. These living entities are His superior energy because the\nquality of their existence is one and the same with the Supreme, but they are\nnever equal to the Lord in quantity of power. While exploiting the gross and\nsubtle inferior energy (matter), the superior energy (the living entity) forgets\nhis real spiritual mind and intelligence. This forgetfulness is due to the\ninfluence of matter upon the living entity. But when the living entity becomes\nfree from the influence of the illusory material energy, he attains the stage\ncalled mukti, or liberation. The false ego, under the influence of material\nillusion, thinks, \u201cI am matter, and material acquisitions are mine.\u201d His actual\nposition is realized when he is liberated from all material ideas, including the\nconception of his becoming one in all respects with God. Therefore one may\nconclude that the G\u012bt\u0101 confirms the living entity to be only one of the\nmulti-energies of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; and when this energy is freed from material\ncontamination, it becomes fully K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, or liberated.",

TRANSLATION  Of all that is material and all that is spiritual in this world, know for\ncertain that I am both its origin and dissolution.  PURPORT  Everything that exists is a product of matter and spirit. Spirit is the basic\nfield of creation, and matter is created by spirit. Spirit is not created at a\ncertain stage of material development. Rather, this material world is manifested\nonly on the basis of spiritual energy. This material body is developed because\nspirit is present within matter; a child grows gradually to boyhood and then to\nmanhood because of that superior energy, spirit soul, being present. Similarly,\nthe entire cosmic manifestation of the gigantic universe is developed because of\nthe presence of the Supersoul, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Therefore spirit and matter, which combine\ntogether to manifest this gigantic universal form, are originally two energies\nof the Lord, and consequently the Lord is the original cause of everything. A\nfragmental part and parcel of the Lord, namely, the living entity, may by\nmanipulation of material energy construct a skyscraper, factory or city, but he\ncannot create matter out of nothing, and he certainly cannot construct a planet\nor a universe. The cause of the universe is the Supersoul, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the supreme\ncreator of all individual souls and the original cause of all causes, as the\nKa\u1e6dha Upani\u1e63ad confirms: nityo nity\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 cetana\u015b cetan\u0101n\u0101m.",

TRANSLATION  O conquerer of wealth [Arjuna], there is no Truth superior to Me. Everything\nrests upon Me, as pearls are strung on a thread.  PURPORT  There is a common controversy over whether the Supreme Absolute Truth is\npersonal or impersonal. As far as Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is concerned, the Absolute Truth\nis the Personality of Godhead \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and this is confirmed in every step. In\nthis verse, in particular, it is stressed that the Absolute Truth is a person.\nThat the Personality of Godhead is the Supreme Absolute Truth is also the\naffirmation of the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101: \u012b\u015bvara\u1e25 parama\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u1e25\nsac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha\u1e25; that is, the Supreme Absolute Truth Personality of\nGodhead is Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who is the primeval Lord, the reservoir of all pleasure,\nGovinda, and the eternal form of complete bliss and knowledge. These authorities\nleave no doubt that the Absolute Truth is the Supreme Person, the cause of all\ncauses. The impersonalist, however, argues on the strength of the Vedic version\ngiven in the \u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad: tato yad uttaratara\u1e41 tad ar\u016bpam an\u0101maya\u1e41 ya\netad vidur am\u1e5bt\u0101s te bhavanti athetare du\u1e25kham ev\u0101pi yanti. \u201cIn the material\nworld Brahm\u0101, the primeval living entity within the universe, is understood to\nbe the supreme amongst the demigods, human beings and lower animals. But beyond\nBrahm\u0101 there is the Transcendence who has no material form and is free from all\nmaterial contaminations. Anyone who can know Him also becomes transcendental,\nbut those who do not know Him suffer the miseries of the material world.\u201d  The impersonalist puts more stress on the word ar\u016bpam. But this ar\u016bpam is not\nimpersonal. It indicates the transcendental form of eternity, bliss and\nknowledge as described in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 quoted above. Other verses in the\n\u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad substantiate this as follows:  ved\u0101ham eta\u1e41 puru\u1e63a\u1e41 mah\u0101ntam \u0101ditya-var\u1e47a\u1e41 tamasa\u1e25 parast\u0101t tam eva vidv\u0101n\nam\u1e5bta iha bhavati n\u0101nya\u1e25 panth\u0101 vidyate ayan\u0101ya yasm\u0101t para\u1e41 n\u0101param asti ki\u00f1cid\nyasm\u0101nn\u0101\u1e47\u012byo na jy\u0101yo \u2019sti ki\u00f1cit  \"I know that Supreme Personality of Godhead who is transcendental to all\nmaterial conceptions of darkness. Only he who knows Him can transcend the bonds\nof birth and death. There is no way for liberation other than this knowledge of\nthat Supreme Person.  \u201cThere is no truth superior to that Supreme Person because He is the supermost.\nHe is smaller than the smallest, and He is greater than the greatest. He is\nsituated as a silent tree, and He illumines the transcendental sky, and as a\ntree spreads its roots, He spreads His extensive energies.\u201d  From these verses one concludes that the Supreme Absolute Truth is the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead who is all-pervading by His multi-energies, both material\nand spiritual.",

TRANSLATION  O son of Kunt\u012b [Arjuna], I am the taste of water, the light of the sun and the\nmoon, the syllable om in the Vedic mantras; I am the sound in ether and ability\nin man.  PURPORT  This verse explains how the Lord is all-pervasive by His diverse material and\nspiritual energies. The Supreme Lord can be preliminarily perceived by His\ndifferent energies, and in this way He is realized impersonally. As the demigod\nin the sun is a person and is perceived by his all-pervading energy, the\nsunshine, similarly, the Lord, although in His eternal abode, is perceived by\nHis all-pervading, diffusive energies. The taste of water is the active\nprinciple of water. No one likes to drink sea water because the pure taste of\nwater is mixed with salt. Attraction for water depends on the purity of the\ntaste, and this pure taste is one of the energies of the Lord. The impersonalist\nperceives the presence of the Lord in water by its taste, and the personalist\nalso glorifies the Lord for His kindly supplying water to quench man\u2019s thirst.\nThat is the way of perceiving the Supreme. Practically speaking, there is no\nconflict between personalism and impersonalism. One who knows God knows that the\nimpersonal conception and personal conception are simultaneously present in\neverything and that there is no contradiction. Therefore Lord Caitanya\nestablished His sublime doctrine: acintya-bheda and\nabheda-tattvam\u2014simultaneously one and different.  The light of the sun and the moon is also originally emanating from the\nbrahmajyoti, which is the impersonal effulgence of the Lord. Similarly pra\u1e47ava\nor the omk\u0101ra transcendental sound used in the beginning of every Vedic hymn to\naddress the Supreme Lord also emanates from Him. Because the impersonalists are\nvery much afraid of addressing the Supreme Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by His innumerable names,\nthey prefer to vibrate the transcendental sound omk\u0101ra. But they do not realize\nthat omk\u0101ra is the sound representation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The jurisdiction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness extends everywhere, and one who knows K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is\nblessed. Those who do not know K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are in illusion, and so knowledge of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nis liberation, and ignorance of Him is bondage.",

PURPORT  Pu\u1e47ya means that which is not decomposed; pu\u1e47ya is original. Everything in the\nmaterial world has a certain flavor or fragrance, as the flavor and fragrance in\na flower, or in the earth, in water, in fire, in air, etc. The uncontaminated\nflavor, the original flavor, which permeates everything, is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Similarly,\neverything has a particular original taste, and this taste can be changed by the\nmixture of chemicals. So everything original has some smell, some fragrance, and\nsome taste. Vibh\u0101va means fire. Without fire we cannot run factories, we cannot\ncook, etc., and that fire is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The heat in the fire is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. According to\nVedic medicine, indigestion is due to a low temperature in the belly. So even\nfor digestion fire is needed. In K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness we become aware that earth,\nwater, fire, air and every active principle, all chemicals and all material\nelements are due to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The duration of man\u2019s life is also due to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\nTherefore by the grace of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, man can prolong his life or diminish it.

TRANSLATION  O son of P\u1e5bth\u0101, know that I am the original seed of all existences, the\nintelligence of the intelligent, and the prowess of all powerful men.  PURPORT  B\u012bjam means seed; K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the seed of everything. In contact with material\nnature, the seed fructifies into various living entities, movable and inert.\nBirds, beasts, men and many other living creatures are moving living entities;\ntrees and plants, however, are inert\u2014they cannot move, but only stand. Every\nentity is contained within the scope of 8,400,000 species of life; some of them\nare moving and some of them are inert. In all cases, however, the seed of their\nlife is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. As stated in Vedic literature, Brahman, or the Supreme Absolute\nTruth, is that from which everything is emanating. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is Parabrahman, the\nSupreme Spirit. Brahman is impersonal and Parabrahman is personal. Impersonal\nBrahman is situated in the personal aspect\u2014that is stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.\nTherefore, originally, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the source of everything. He is the root. As the\nroot of a tree maintains the whole tree, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, being the original root of all\nthings, maintains everything in this material manifestation.

Those who are\nbewildered by these three modes cannot understand that transcendental to this\nmaterial nature is the Supreme Lord, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In this material world everyone is\nunder the influence of these three gu\u1e47as and is thus bewildered.  Bv nature living entities have particular types of body and particular types of\npsychic and biological activities accordingly. There are four classes of men\nfunctioning in the three material modes of nature. Those who are purely in the\nmode of goodness are called br\u0101hma\u1e47as. Those who are purely in the mode of\npassion are called k\u1e63atriyas. Those who are in the modes of both passion and\nignorance are called vai\u015byas. Those who are completely in ignorance are called\n\u015b\u016bdras. And those who are less than that are animals or animal life. However,\nthese designations are not permanent. I may either be a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, k\u1e63atriya,\nvai\u015bya or whatever\u2014in any case, this life is temporary. But although life is\ntemporary and we do not know what we are going to be in the next life, still, by\nthe spell of this illusory energy, we consider ourselves in the light of this\nbodily conception of life, and we thus think that we are American, Indian,\nRussian or br\u0101hma\u1e47a, Hindu, Muslim, etc. And if we become entangled with the\nmodes of material nature, then we forget the Supreme Personality of Godhead who\nis behind all these modes. So Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says that men, deluded by these three\nmodes of nature, do not understand that behind the material background is the\nSupreme Godhead.  There are many different kinds of living entities\u2014human beings, demigods,\nanimals, etc.\u2014and each and every one of them is under the influence of material\nnature, and all of them have forgotten the transcendent Personality of Godhead.\nThose who are in the modes of passion and ignorance, and even those who are in\nthe mode of goodness, cannot go beyond the impersonal Brahman conception of the\nAbsolute Truth. They are bewildered before the Supreme Lord in His personal\nfeature, which possesses all beauty, opulence, knowledge, strength, fame and\nrenunciation. When even those who are in goodness cannot understand, what hope\nis there for those in passion and ignorance? K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is\ntranscendental to all these three modes of material nature, and those who are\ntruly established in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness are actually liberated.### 7.14  daiv\u012b hy e\u1e63\u0101 gu\u1e47a-may\u012b  mama m\u0101y\u0101 duratyay\u0101  m\u0101m eva ye prapadyante  m\u0101y\u0101m et\u0101\u1e41 taranti te  daiv\u012b\u2014transcendental; hi\u2014certainly; e\u1e63\u0101\u2014this; gu\u1e47amay\u012b\u2014consisting of the three\nmodes of material nature; mama\u2014My; m\u0101y\u0101\u2014energy; duratyay\u0101\u2014very difficult to\novercome; m\u0101m\u2014unto Me; eva\u2014certainly; ye\u2014those; prapadyante\u2014surrender; m\u0101y\u0101m\net\u0101m\u2014this illusory energy; taranti\u2014overcome; te\u2014they.  TRANSLATION  This divine energy of Mine, consisting of the three modes of material nature, is\ndifficult to overcome. But those who have surrendered unto Me can easily cross\nbeyond it.  PURPORT  The Supreme Personality of Godhead has innumerable energies, and all these\nenergies are divine. Although the living entities are part of His energies and\nare therefore divine, due to contact with material energy, their original\nsuperior power is covered. Being thus covered by material energy, one cannot\npossibly overcome its influence. As previously stated, both the material and\nspiritual natures, being emanations from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, are\neternal. The living entities belong to the eternal superior nature of the Lord,\nbut due to contamination by the inferior nature, matter, their illusion is also\neternal. The conditioned soul is therefore called nitya-baddha, or eternally\nconditioned. No one can trace out the history of his becoming conditioned at a\ncertain date in material history. Consequently, his release from the clutches of\nmaterial nature is very difficult, even though that material nature is an\ninferior energy, because material energy is ultimately conducted by the supreme\nwill, which the living entity cannot overcome. Inferior material nature is\ndefined herein as divine nature due to its divine connection and movement by the\ndivine will. Being conducted by divine will, material nature, although inferior,\nacts so wonderfully in the construction and destruction of the cosmic\nmanifestation. The Vedas confirm this as follows:  m\u0101y\u0101\u1e41 tu prak\u1e5bti\u1e41 vidy\u0101n m\u0101yina\u1e41 tu mahe\u015bvaram.  \u201cAlthough m\u0101y\u0101 [illusion] is false or temporary, the background of m\u0101y\u0101 is the\nsupreme magician, the Personality of Godhead, who is Mahe\u015bvara, the supreme\ncontroller.\u201d  Another meaning of gu\u1e47a is rope; it is to be understood that the conditioned\nsoul is tightly tied by the ropes of illusion. A man bound by the hands and feet\ncannot free himself\u2014he must be helped by a person who is unbound. Because the\nbound cannot help the bound, the rescuer must be liberated. Therefore, only Lord\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or His bona fide representative the spiritual master, can release the\nconditioned soul. Without such superior help, one cannot be freed from the\nbondage of material nature. Devotional service, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, can help\none gain such release. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, being the Lord of illusory energy, can order this\ninsurmountable energy to release the conditioned soul. He orders this release\nout of His causeless mercy on the surrendered soul and out of His paternal\naffection for the living entity who is originally a beloved son of the Lord.\nTherefore surrender unto the lotus feet of the Lord is the only means to get\nfree from the clutches of the stringent material nature.  The words m\u0101m eva are also significant. M\u0101m means unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (Vi\u1e63\u1e47u) only, and\nnot Brahm\u0101 or \u015aiva. Although Brahm\u0101 and \u015aiva are greatly elevated and are almost\non the level of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, it is not possible for such incarnations of r\u0101jo-gu\u1e47a\n(passion) and tamo-gu\u1e47a (ignorance) to release the conditioned soul from the\nclutches of m\u0101y\u0101. In other words, both Brahm\u0101 and \u015aiva are also under the\ninfluence of m\u0101y\u0101. Only Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is the master of m\u0101y\u0101; therefore He can alone give\nrelease to the conditioned soul. The Vedas confirm this in the phrase tvam eva\nviditv\u0101 or \u201cFreedom is possible only by understanding K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u201d Even Lord \u015aiva\naffirms that liberation can be achieved only by the mercy of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Lord \u015aiva\nsays:  mukti-prad\u0101t\u0101 sarve\u1e63\u0101\u1e41 vi\u1e63\u1e47ur eva na sa\u1e41\u015baya\u1e25.  \"There is no doubt that Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is the deliverer of liberation for everyone.",

TRANSLATION  Those miscreants who are grossly foolish, lowest among mankind, whose knowledge\nis stolen by illusion, and who partake of the atheistic nature of demons, do not\nsurrender unto Me.  PURPORT  It is said in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that simply by surrendering oneself unto the lotus\nfeet of the Supreme Personality K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one can surmount the stringent laws of\nmaterial nature. At this point a question arises: How is it that educated\nphilosophers, scientists, businessmen, administrators and all the leaders of\nordinary men do not surrender to the lotus feet of \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the all-powerful\nPersonality of Godhead? Mukti, or liberation from the laws of material nature,\nis sought by the leaders of mankind in different ways and with great plans and\nperseverance for a great many years and births. But if that liberation is\npossible by simply surrendering unto the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality\nof Godhead, then why don\u2019t these intelligent and hard-working leaders adopt this\nsimple method?  The G\u012bt\u0101 answers this question very frankly. Those really learned leaders of\nsociety like Brahm\u0101, \u015aiva, Kapila, the Kum\u0101ras, Manu, Vy\u0101sa, Devala, Asita,\nJanaka, Prahl\u0101da, Bali, and later on Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya, R\u0101m\u0101nuj\u0101c\u0101rya, \u015ar\u012b Caitanya\nand many others\u2014who are faithful philosophers, politicians, educators,\nscientists, etc.\u2014surrender to the lotus feet of the Supreme Person, the\nall-powerful authority. Those who are not actually philosophers, scientists,\neducators, administrators, etc., but who pose themselves as such for material\ngain, do not accept the plan or path of the Supreme Lord. They have no idea of\nGod; they simply manufacture their own worldly plans and consequently complicate\nthe problems of material existence in their vain attempts to solve them. Because\nmaterial energy (nature) is so powerful, it can resist the unauthorized plans of\nthe atheists and baffle the knowledge of \u201cplanning commissions.\u201d  The atheistic plan-makers are described herein by the word du\u1e63k\u1e5btina, or\n\u201cmiscreants.\u201d K\u1e5btina means one who has performed meritorious work. The atheist\nplanmaker is sometimes very intelligent and meritorious also, because any\ngigantic plan, good or bad, must take intelligence to execute. But because the\natheist\u2019s brain is improperly utilized in opposing the plan of the Supreme Lord,\nthe atheistic planmaker is called du\u1e63k\u1e5btina, which indicates that his\nintelligence and efforts are misdirected.  In the G\u012bt\u0101 it is clearly mentioned that material energy works fully under the\ndirection of the Supreme Lord. It has no independant authority. It works as the\nshadow moves, in accordance with the movements of the object. But still material\nenergy is very powerful, and the atheist, due to his godless temperament, cannot\nknow how it works; nor can he know the plan of the Supreme Lord. Under illusion\nand the modes of passion and ignorance, all his plans are baffled, as in the\ncase of Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu and R\u0101va\u1e47a, whose plans were smashed to dust although they\nwere both materially learned as scientists, philosophers, administrators and\neducators. These du\u1e63k\u1e5btinas, or miscreants, are of four different patterns, as\noutlined below:  (1) The m\u016b\u1e0dhas are those who are grossly foolish, like hard-working beasts of\nburden. They want to enjoy the fruits of their labor by themselves, and so do\nnot want to part with them for the Supreme. The typical example of the beast of\nburden is the ass. This humble beast is made to work very hard by his master.\nThe ass does not really know for whom he works so hard day and night. He remains\nsatisfied by filling his stomach with a bundle of grass, sleeping for a while\nunder fear of being beaten by his master, and satisfying his sex appetite at the\nrisk of being repeatedly kicked by the opposite party. The ass sings poetry and\nphilosophy sometimes, but this braying only disturbs others. This is the\nposition of the foolish fruitive worker who does not know for whom he should\nwork. He does not know that karma (action) is meant for yaj\u00f1a (sacrifice).  Most often, those who work very hard day and night to clear the burden of\nself-created duties say that they have no time to hear of the immortality of the\nliving being. To such m\u016b\u1e0dhas, material gains, which are destructible, are life\u2019s\nall in all\u2014despite the fact that the m\u016b\u1e0dhas enjoy only a very small fraction of\nthe fruit of labor. Sometimes they spend sleepless days and nights for fruitive\ngain, and although they may have ulcers or indigestion, they are satisfied with\npractically no food; they are simply absorbed in working hard day and night for\nthe benefit of illusory masters. Ignorant of their real master, the foolish\nworkers waste their valuable time serving mammon. Unfortunately, they never\nsurrender to the supreme master of all masters, nor do they take time to hear of\nHim from the proper sources. The swine who eat the soil do not care to accept\nsweetmeats made of sugar and ghee. Similarly, the foolish worker will untiringly\ncontinue to hear of the sense-enjoyable tidings of the flickering mundane force\nthat moves the material world.  (2) Another class of du\u1e63k\u1e5btina, or miscreant, is called the nar\u0101dhama, or the\nlowest of mankind. Nara means human being, and adhama means the lowest. Out of\nthe 8,400,000 different species of living beings, there are 400,000 human\nspecies. Out of these there are numerous lower forms of human life that are\nmostly uncivilized. The civilized human beings are those who have regulated\nprinciples of social, political and religious life. Those who are socially and\npolitically developed, but who have no religious principles, must be considered\nnar\u0101dhamas. Nor is religion without God religion, because the purpose of\nfollowing religious principles is to know the Supreme Truth and man\u2019s relation\nwith Him. In the G\u012bt\u0101 the Personality of Godhead clearly states that there is no\nauthority above Him and that He is the Supreme Truth. The civilized form of\nhuman life is meant for man\u2019s reviving the lost consciousness of his eternal\nrelation with the Supreme Truth, the Personality of Godhead \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who is\nall-powerful. Whoever loses this chance is classified as a nar\u0101dhama. We get\ninformation from revealed scriptures that when the baby is in the mother\u2019s womb\n(an extremely uncomfortable situation) he prays to God for deliverance and\npromises to worship Him alone as soon as he gets out. To pray to God when he is\nin difficulty is a natural instinct in every living being because he is\neternally related with God. But after his deliverance, the child forgets the\ndifficulties of birth and forgets his deliverer also, being influenced by m\u0101y\u0101,\nthe illusory energy.  It is the duty of the guardians of children to revive the divine consciousness\ndormant in them. The ten processes of reformatory ceremonies, as enjoined in the\nManu-sm\u1e5bti, which is the guide to religious principles, are meant for reviving\nGod consciousness in the system of var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama. However, no process is strictly\nfollowed now in any part of the world, and therefore 99.9 percent of the\npopulation is nar\u0101dhama.  When the whole population becomes nar\u0101dhama, naturally all their so-called\neducation is made null and void by the all-powerful energy of physical nature.\nAccording to the standard of the G\u012bt\u0101, a learned man is he who sees on equal\nterms the learned br\u0101hma\u1e47a, the dog, the cow, the elephant and the dog-eater.\nThat is the vision of a true devotee. \u015ar\u012b Nity\u0101nanda Prabhu, who is the\nincarnation of Godhead as divine master, delivered the typical nar\u0101dhamas, the\nbrothers Jagai and Madhai, and showed how the mercy of a real devotee is\nbestowed upon the lowest of mankind. So the nar\u0101dhama who is condemned by the\nPersonality of Godhead can again revive his spiritual consciousness only by the\nmercy of a devotee.  \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, in propagating the bh\u0101gavata-dharma or activities of\nthe devotees, has recommended that people submissively hear the message of the\nPersonality of Godhead. The essence of this message is Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. The lowest\namongst human beings can be delivered by this submissive hearing process only,\nbut unfortunately they even deny giving an aural reception to these messages,\nand what to speak of surrendering to the will of the Supreme Lord? Nar\u0101dhamas,\nor the lowest of mankind, will fully neglect the prime duty of the human being.  (3) The next class of du\u1e63k\u1e5btina is called m\u0101yay\u0101pah\u1e5bta-j\u00f1\u0101na, or those persons\nwhose erudite knowledge has been nullified by the influence of illusory material\nenergy. They are mostly very learned fellows\u2014great philosophers, poets,\nliterati, scientists, etc.\u2014but the illusory energy misguides them, and therefore\nthey disobey the Supreme Lord.  There are a great number of m\u0101yay\u0101pah\u1e5bta-j\u00f1\u0101nas at the present moment, even\namongst the scholars of the G\u012bt\u0101. In the G\u012bt\u0101, in plain and simple language, it\nis stated that \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. There is none\nequal to or greater than Him. He is mentioned as the father of Brahm\u0101, the\noriginal father of all human beings. In fact, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is said to be not only\nthe father of Brahm\u0101 but also the father of all species of life. He is the root\nof the impersonal Brahman and Param\u0101tm\u0101; the Supersoul in every entity is His\nplenary portion. He is the fountainhead of everything, and everyone is advised\nto surrender unto His lotus feet. Despite all these clear statements, the\nm\u0101yay\u0101pah\u1e5bta-j\u00f1\u0101na deride the Personality of the Supreme Lord and consider Him\nmerely another human being. They do not know that the blessed form of human life\nis designed after the eternal and transcendental feature of the Supreme Lord.  All the unauthorized interpretations of the G\u012bt\u0101 by the class of\nm\u0101yay\u0101pah\u1e5bta-j\u00f1\u0101na, outside the purview of the parampar\u0101 system, are so many\nstumbling blocks in the path of spiritual understanding. The deluded\ninterpreters do not surrender unto the lotus feet of \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, nor do they\nteach others to follow this principle.  (4) The last class of du\u1e63k\u1e5btina is called \u0101sura\u1e41 bh\u0101vam \u0101\u015brita, or those of\ndemonic principles. This class is openly atheistic. Some of them argue that the\nSupreme Lord can never descend upon this material world, but they are unable to\ngive any tangible reasons as to why not. There are others who make Him\nsubordinate to the impersonal feature, although the opposite is declared in the\nG\u012bt\u0101. Envious of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the atheist will present a\nnumber of illicit incarnations manufactured in the factory of his brain. Such\npersons whose very principle of life is to decry the Personality of Godhead\ncannot surrender unto the lotus feet of \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.  \u015ar\u012b Y\u0101mun\u0101c\u0101rya Albandru of South India said, \u201cO my Lord! You are unknowable to\npersons involved with atheistic principles despite Your uncommon qualities,\nfeatures, and activities and despite Your personality being confirmed by all the\nrevealed scriptures in the quality of goodness, and despite Your being\nacknowledged by the famous authorities renowned for their depth of knowledge in\nthe transcendental science and situated in the godly qualities.\u201d  Therefore, (1) grossly foolish persons, (2) the lowest of mankind, (3) the\ndeluded speculators, and (4) the professed atheists, as above mentioned, never\nsurrender unto the lotus feet of the Personality of Godhead in spite of all\nscriptural and authoritative advice.",

PURPORT  Unlike the miscreants, these are adherents of the regulative principles of the\nscriptures, and they are called suk\u1e5btina, or those who obey the rules and\nregulations of scriptures, the moral and social laws, and are, more or less,\ndevoted to the Supreme Lord. Out of these there are four classes of men\u2014those\nwho are sometimes distressed, those who are in need of money, those who are\nsometimes inquisitive, and those who are sometimes searching after knowledge of\nthe Absolute Truth. These persons come to the Supreme Lord for devotional\nservice under different conditions. These are not pure devotees because they\nhave some aspiration to fulfill in exchange for devotional service. Pure\ndevotional service is without aspiration and without desire for material profit.\nThe Bhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu defines pure devotion thus:  any\u0101bhil\u0101\u1e63it\u0101\u015b\u016bnya\u1e41 j\u00f1\u0101na-karm\u0101dy-an\u0101v\u1e5btam \u0101nuk\u016blyena k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47\u0101nu\u015b\u012blana\u1e41 bhaktir\nuttam\u0101.  \u201cOne should render transcendental loving service to the Supreme Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nfavorably and without desire for material profit or gain through fruitive\nactivities or philosophical speculation. That is called pure devotional\nservice.\u201d  When these four kinds of persons come to the Supreme Lord for devotional service\nand are completely purified by the association of a pure devotee, they also\nbecome pure devotees. As far as the miscreants are concerned, for them\ndevotional service is very difficult because their lives are selfish, irregular\nand without spiritual goals. But even some of them, by chance, when they come in\ncontact with a pure devotee, also become pure devotees.  Those who are always busy with fruitive activities come to the Lord in material\ndistress and at that time associate with pure devotees and become, in their\ndistress, devotees of the Lord. Those who are simply frustrated also come\nsometimes to associate with the pure devotees and become inquisitive to know\nabout God. Similarly, when the dry philosophers are frustrated in every field of\nknowledge, they sometimes want to learn of God, and they come to the Supreme\nLord to render devotional service and thus transcend knowledge of the impersonal\nBrahman and the localized Param\u0101tm\u0101 and come to the personal conception of\nGodhead by the grace of the Supreme Lord or His pure devotee. On the whole, when\nthe distressed, the inquisitive, the seekers of knowledge, and those who are in\nneed of money are free from all material desires, and when they fully understand\nthat material remuneration has nothing to do with spiritual improvement, they\nbecome pure devotees. As long as such a purified stage is not attained, devotees\nin transcendental service to the Lord are tainted with fruitive activities, and\nthey search after mundane knowledge, etc. So one has to transcend all this\nbefore one can come to the stage of pure devotional service.",

And of the four orders, the devotee who is in full knowledge and is at the\nsame time engaged in devotional service is, the Lord says, the best. By\nsearching after knowledge one realizes that his self is different from his\nmaterial body, and when further advanced he comes to the knowledge of impersonal\nBrahman and Param\u0101tm\u0101. When one is fully purified, he realizes that his\nconstitutional position is to be the eternal servant of God.

The Lord says that all are magnanimous because anyone who comes to the\nLord for any purpose is called a mah\u0101tm\u0101 or great soul. The devotees who want\nsome benefit out of devotional service are accepted by the Lord because there is\nan exchange of affection. Out of affection they ask the Lord for some material\nbenefit, and when they get it they become so satisfied that they also advance in\ndevotional service. But the devotee in full knowledge is considered to be very\ndear to the Lord because his only purpose is to serve the Supreme Lord with love\nand devotion.

TRANSLATION  After many births and deaths, he who is actually in knowledge surrenders unto\nMe, knowing Me to be the cause of all causes and all that is. Such a great soul\nis very rare.  PURPORT  The living entity, while executing devotional service or transcendental rituals\nafter many, many births, may actually become situated in transcendental pure\nknowledge that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the ultimate goal of\nspiritual realization. In the beginning of spiritual realization, while one is\ntrying to give up one\u2019s attachment to materialism, there is some leaning towards\nimpersonalism, but when one is further advanced he can understand that there are\nactivities in the spiritual life and that these activities constitute devotional\nservice. Realizing this, he becomes attached to the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead and surrenders to Him. At such a time one can understand that Lord \u015ar\u012b\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s mercy is everything, that He is the cause of all causes and that this\nmaterial manifestation is not independant from Him. He realizes the material\nworld to be a perverted reflection of spiritual variegatedness and realizes that\nin everything there is a relationship with the Supreme Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Thus he\nthinks of everything in relation to V\u0101sudeva, or \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Such a universal\nvision of V\u0101sudeva precipitates one\u2019s full surrender to the Supreme Lord \u015ar\u012b\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the highest goal. Such surrendered great souls are very rare.  This verse is very nicely explained in the Third Chapter of \u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara\nUpani\u1e63ad: \u201cIn this body there are powers of speaking, of seeing, of hearing, of\nmental activities, etc. But these are not important if not related to the\nSupreme Lord. And because V\u0101sudeva is all-pervading and everything is V\u0101sudeva,\nthe devotee surrenders in full knowledge.\u201d (Cf. Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 7.17 and 11.40)",

TRANSLATION  Those whose minds are distorted by material desires surrender unto demigods and\nfollow the particular rules and regulations of worship according to their own\nnatures.  PURPORT  Those who are freed from all material contaminations surrender unto the Supreme\nLord and engage in His devotional service. As long as the material contamination\nis not completely washed off, they are by nature nondevotees. But even those who\nhave material desires and who resort to the Supreme Lord are not so much\nattracted by external nature; because of approaching the right goal, they soon\nbecome free from all material lust. In the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam it is recommended\nthat whether one is free from all material desires, or is full of material\ndesires, or desires liberation from material contamination, or is a pure devotee\nand has no desire for material sense gratification, he should in all cases\nsurrender to V\u0101sudeva and worship Him.  It is said in the Bh\u0101gavatam that less intelligent people who have lost their\nspiritual sense take shelter of demigods for immediate fulfillment of material\ndesires. Generally, such people do not go to the Supreme Personality of Godhead,\nbecause they are in particular modes of nature (ignorance and passion) and\ntherefore worship various demigods. Following the rules and regulations of\nworship, they are satisfied. The worshipers of demigods are motivated by small\ndesires and do not know how to reach the supreme goal, but a devotee of the\nSupreme Lord is not misguided. Because in Vedic literature there are\nrecommendations for worshiping different gods for different purposes (e.g., a\ndiseased man is recommended to worship the sun), those who are not devotees of\nthe Lord think that for certain purposes demigods are better than the Supreme\nLord. But a pure devotee knows that the Supreme Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the master of all.\nIn the Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta it is said that only the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is master and all others are servants. Therefore a pure devotee\nnever goes to demigods for satisfaction of his material needs. He depends on the\nSupreme Lord. And the pure devotee is satisfied with whatever He gives.",

TRANSLATION  I am in everyone\u2019s heart as the Supersoul. As soon as one desires to worship the\ndemigods, I make his faith steady so that he can devote himself to some\nparticular deity.  PURPORT  God has given independence to everyone; therefore, if a person desires to have\nmaterial enjoyment and wants very sincerely to have such facilities from the\nmaterial demigods, the Supreme Lord, as Supersoul in everyone\u2019s heart,\nunderstands and gives facilities to such persons. As the supreme father of all\nliving entities, He does not interfere with their independence, but gives all\nfacilities so that they can fulfill their material desires. Some may ask why the\nall-powerful God gives facilities to the living entities for enjoying this\nmaterial world and so lets them fall into the trap of the illusory energy. The\nanswer is that if the Supreme Lord as Supersoul does not give such facilities,\nthen there is no meaning to independence. Therefore He gives everyone full\nindependence\u2014whatever one likes\u2014but His ultimate instruction we find in the\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101: man should give up all other engagements and fully surrender unto\nHim. That will make man happy.  Both the living entity and the demigods are subordinate to the will of the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead; therefore the living entity cannot worship the\ndemigod by his own desire, nor can the demigod bestow any benediction without\nthe supreme will. As it is said, not a blade of grass moves without the will of\nthe Supreme Personality of Godhead. Generally, persons who are distressed in the\nmaterial world go to the demigods, as they are advised in the Vedic literature.\nA person wanting some particular thing may worship such and such a demigod. For\nexample, a diseased person is recommended to worship the sun-god; a person\nwanting education may worship the goddess of learning, Sarasvat\u012b; and a person\nwanting a beautiful wife may worship the goddess Um\u0101, the wife of Lord \u015aiva. In\nthis way there are recommendations in the \u015b\u0101stras (Vedic scriptures) for\ndifferent modes of worship of different demigods. And because a particular\nliving entity wants to enjoy a particular material facility, the Lord inspires\nhim with a strong desire to achieve that benediction from that particular\ndemigod, and so he successfully receives the benediction. The particular mode of\nthe devotional attitude of the living entity toward a particular type of demigod\nis also arranged by the Supreme Lord. The demigods cannot infuse the living\nentities with such an affinity, but because He is the Supreme Lord or the\nSupersoul who is present in the heart of all living entities, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a gives\nimpetus to man to worship certain demigods. The demigods are actually different\nparts of the universal body of the Supreme Lord; therefore they have no\nindependence. In the Vedic literature (Taittir\u012bya Upani\u1e63ad, First Anuv\u0101ka) it is\nstated: \u201cThe Supreme Personality of Godhead as Supersoul is also present within\nthe heart of the demigod; therefore He arranges through the demigod to fulfill\nthe desire of the living entity. But both the demigod and the living entity are\ndependant on the supreme wil1. They are not independant.\u201d",

PURPORT  The demigods cannot award benediction to the devotees without the permission of\nthe Supreme Lord. The living entity may forget that everything is the property\nof the Supreme Lord, but the demigods do not forget. So the worship of demigods\nand achievement of desired results are not due to the demigods but to the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead, by arrangement. The less intelligent living\nentity does not know this, and therefore he foolishly goes to the demigods for\nsome benefit. But the pure devotee, when in need of something, prays only to the\nSupreme Lord. Asking for material benefit, however, is not a sign of a pure\ndevotee. A living entity goes to the demigods usually because he is mad to\nfulfill his lust. This happens when something undue is desired by the living\nentity, and the Lord Himself does not fulfill the desire. In the\nCaitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta it is said that one who worships the Supreme Lord and at the\nsame time desires material enjoyment is contradictory in his desires. Devotional\nservice of the Supreme Lord and the worship of a demigod cannot be on the same\nplatform because worship of a demigod is material and devotional service to the\nSupreme Lord is completely spiritual.  For the living entity who desires to return to Godhead, material desires are\nimpediments. A pure devotee of the Lord is therefore not awarded the material\nbenefits desired by less intelligent living entities who prefer to worship\ndemigods of the material world rather than engage in devotional service of the\nSupreme Lord.",

TRANSLATION  Men of small intelligence worship the demigods, and their fruits are limited and\ntemporary. Those who worship the demigods go to the planets of the demigods, but\nMy devotees ultimately reach My supreme planet.  PURPORT  Some commentators on the G\u012bt\u0101 say that one who worships a demigod can reach the\nSupreme Lord, but here it is clearly stated that the worshipers of demigods go\nto the different planetary systems where various demigods are situated, just as\na worshiper of the sun achieves the sun or a worshiper of the demigod of the\nmoon achieves the moon. Similarly, if anyone wants to worship a demigod like\nIndra, he can attain that particular god\u2019s planet. It is not that everyone,\nregardless of whatever demigod is worshiped, will reach the Supreme Personality\nof Godhead. That is denied here, for it is clearly stated that the worshipers of\ndemigods go to different planets in the material world, but the devotee of the\nSupreme Lord goes directly to the supreme planet of the Personality of Godhead.  Here the point may be raised that if the demigods are different parts of the\nbody of the Supreme Lord, then the same end should be achieved by worshiping\nthem. However, worshipers of the demigods are less intelligent because they\ndon\u2019t know to what part of the body food must be supplied. Some of them are so\nfoolish that they claim that there are many parts and many ways to supply food.\nThis isn\u2019t very sanguine. Can anyone supply food to the body through the ears or\neyes? They do not know that these demigods are different parts of the universal\nbody of the Supreme Lord, and in their ignorance they believe that each and\nevery demigod is a separate God and a competitor of the Supreme Lord.  Not only are demigods parts of the Supreme Lord, but ordinary living entities\nare also. In the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam it is stated that the br\u0101hma\u1e47as are the head\nof the Supreme Lord, the k\u1e63atriyas are the arms, etc., and that all serve\ndifferent functions. Regardless of the situation, if one knows that both the\ndemigods and himself are part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, his knowledge is\nperfect. But if he does not understand this, he achieves different planets where\nthe demigods reside. This is not the same destination the devotee reaches.  The results achieved by the demigods\u2019 benedictions are perishable because within\nthis material world the planets, the demigods and their worshipers are all\nperishable. Therefore it is clearly stated in this verse that all results\nachieved by worshiping demigods are perishable, and therefore such worship is\nperformed by the less intelligent living entity. Because the pure devotee\nengaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness in devotional service of the Supreme Lord\nachieves eternal blissful existence that is full of knowledge, his achievements\nand those of the common worshiper of the demigods are different. The Supreme\nLord is unlimited; His favor is unlimited; His mercy is unlimited. Therefore the\nmercy of the Supreme Lord upon His pure devotees is unlimited.",

TRANSLATION  Unintelligent men, who know Me not, think that I have assumed this form and\npersonality. Due to their small knowledge, they do not know My higher nature,\nwhich is changeless and supreme.

Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in His\npersonal form is here speaking before Arjuna, and still, due to ignorance,\nimpersonalists argue that the Supreme Lord ultimately has no form. Y\u0101mun\u0101c\u0101rya,\na great devotee of the Lord in the disciplic succession from R\u0101m\u0101nuj\u0101c\u0101rya, has\nwritten two very appropriate verses in this connection. He says, \u201cMy dear Lord,\ndevotees like Vy\u0101sadeva and N\u0101rada know You to be the Personality of Godhead. By\nunderstanding different Vedic literatures, one can come to know Your\ncharacteristics, Your form and Your activities, and one can thus understand that\nYou are the Supreme Personality of Godhead. But those who are in the modes of\npassion and ignorance, the demons, the nondevotees, cannot understand You. They\nare unable to understand You. However expert such nondevotees may be in\ndiscussing Ved\u0101nta and the Upani\u1e63ads and other Vedic literatures, it is not\npossible for them to understand the Personality of Godhead.\u201d  In the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 it is stated that the Personality of Godhead cannot be\nunderstood simply by study of the Ved\u0101nta literature. Only by the mercy of the\nSupreme Lord can the Personality of the Supreme be known. Therefore in this\nverse it is clearly stated that not only the worshipers of the demigods are less\nintelligent, but those nondevotees who are engaged in Ved\u0101nta and speculation on\nVedic literature without any tinge of true K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness are also less\nintelligent, and for them it is not possible to understand God\u2019s personal\nnature. Persons who are under the impression that the Absolute Truth is\nimpersonal are described as asuras, which means one who does not know the\nultimate feature of the Absolute Truth. In the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam it is stated\nthat supreme realization begins from the impersonal Brahman and then rises to\nthe localized Supersoul\u2014but the ultimate word in the Absolute Truth is the\nPersonality of Godhead. Modern impersonalists are still less intelligent, for\nthey do not even follow their great predecessor, \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101c\u0101rya, who has\nspecifically stated that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\nImpersonalists, therefore, not knowing the Supreme Truth, think K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to be only\nthe son of Devak\u012b and Vasudeva, or a prince, or a powerful living entity. This\nis also condemned in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101: \u201cOnly the fools regard Me as an ordinary\nperson.\u201d The fact is that no one can understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a without rendering\ndevotional service and without developing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. The G\u012bt\u0101 confirms\nthis.  One cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or His form,\nquality or name simply by mental speculation or by discussing Vedic literature.\nOne must understand Him by devotional service. When one is fully engaged in\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, beginning by chanting the mah\u0101mantra\u2014Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare\u2014then\nonly can one understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Nondevotee\nimpersonalists think that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has a body made of this material nature and that\nall His activities, His form and everything, are m\u0101y\u0101. These impersonalists are\nknown as M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b. They do not know the ultimate truth.  The twentieth verse clearly states: \u201cThose who are blinded by lusty desires\nsurrender unto the different demigods.\u201d It is accepted that besides the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead, there are demigods who have their different planets (### .\n7.23), and the Lord also has a planet. It is also stated that the worshipers of\nthe demigods go to the different planets of the demigods, and those who are\ndevotees of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a go to the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aloka planet. Although this is clearly\nstated, the foolish impersonalists still maintain that the Lord is formless and\nthat these forms are impositions. From the study of the G\u012bt\u0101 does it appear that\nthe demigods and their abodes are impersonal? Clearly, neither the demigods nor\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, are impersonal. They are all persons;\nLord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and He has His own planet, and\nthe demigods have theirs.  Therefore the monistic contention that ultimate truth is formless and that form\nis imposed does not hold true. It is clearly stated here that it is not imposed.\nFrom the G\u012bt\u0101 we can clearly understand that the forms of the demigods and the\nform of the Supreme Lord are simultaneously existing and that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is\nsac-cid-\u0101nanda, eternal blissful knowledge. The Vedas also confirm that the\nSupreme Absolute Truth is \u0101nandamaya, or full of blissful pleasure, and that He\nis abhy\u0101s\u0101t, by nature the reservoir of unlimited auspicious qualities. And in\nthe G\u012bt\u0101 the Lord says that although He is aja (unborn), He still appears. These\nare the facts that we should understand from the G\u012bt\u0101. We cannot understand how\nthe Supreme Personality of Godhead can be impersonal; the imposition theory of\nthe impersonalist monist is false as far as the statements of the G\u012bt\u0101 are\nconcerned. It is clear herein that the Supreme Absolute Truth, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, has\nboth form and personality.",

For them I am covered by\nMy eternal creative potency [yoga-m\u0101y\u0101]; and so the deluded world knows Me not,\nwho am unborn and infallible.  PURPORT  lt may be argued that since K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was present on this earth and was visible to\neveryone, then why isn\u2019t He manifest to everyone now? But actually He was not\nmanifest to everyone. When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was present there were only a few people who\ncould understand Him to be the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the assembly\nof Kurus, when \u015ai\u015bup\u0101la spoke against K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a being elected president of the\nassembly, Bh\u012b\u1e63ma supported Him and proclaimed Him to be the Supreme God.\nSimilarly, the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas and a few others knew that He was the Supreme, but not\neveryone. He was not revealed to the nondevotees and the common man. Therefore\nin the G\u012bt\u0101 K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says that but for His pure devotees, all men consider Him to\nbe like themselves. He was manifest only to His devotees as the reservoir of all\npleasure. But to others, to unintelligent nondevotees, He was covered by His\neternal potency.  In the prayers of Kunt\u012b in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (1.8.18), it is said that the\nLord is covered by the curtain of yoga-m\u0101y\u0101 and thus ordinary people cannot\nunderstand Him. Kunt\u012b prays: \u201cO my Lord, You are the maintainer of the entire\nuniverse, and devotional service to You is the highest religious principle.\nTherefore, I pray that You will also maintain me. Your transcendental form is\ncovered by the yoga-m\u0101y\u0101. The brahmajyoti is the covering of the internal\npotency. May You kindly remove this glowing effulgence that impedes my seeing\nYour sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha, Your eternal form of bliss and knowledge.\u201d  This yoga-m\u0101y\u0101 curtain is also mentioned in the Fifteenth Chapter of the G\u012bt\u0101.\nThe Supreme Personality of Godhead in His transcendental form of bliss and\nknowledge is covered by the eternal potency of brahmajyoti and the less\nintelligent impersonalists cannot see the Supreme on this account. Also in the\n\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (10.14.7) there is this prayer by Brahm\u0101: \u201cO Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead, O Supersoul, O master of all mystery, who can calculate\nYour potency and pastimes in this world? You are always expanding Your eternal\npotency, and therefore no one can understand You. Learned scientists and learned\nscholars can examine the atomic constitution of the material world or even the\nplanets, but still they are unable to calculate Your energy and potency,\nalthough You are present before them.\u201d The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is not only unborn, but He is avyaya, inexhaustible. His eternal form is\nbliss and knowledge, and His energies are all inexhaustible.",

TRANSLATION  O Arjuna, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, I know everything that has\nhappened in the past, all that is happening in the present, and all things that\nare yet to come. I also know all living entities; but Me no one knows.  PURPORT  Here the question of personality and impersonality is clearly stated. If K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a,\nthe form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is considered by the\nimpersonalists to be m\u0101y\u0101, to be material, then He would, like the living\nentity, change His body and forget everything in His past life. Anyone with a\nmaterial body cannot remember his past life, nor can he foretell his future\nlife, nor can he predict the outcome of his present life; therefore he cannot\nknow what is happening in past, present and future. Unless one is liberated from\nmaterial contamination, he cannot know past, present and future.\nUnlike the ordinary human being, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a clearly says that He completely\nknows what happened in the past, what is happening in the present, and what will\nhappen in the future. In the Fourth Chapter we have seen that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nremembers instructing Vivasv\u0101n, the sun-god, millions of years ago. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a knows\nevery living entity because He is situated in every living being\u2019s heart as the\nSupreme Soul. But despite His presence in every living entity as Supersoul and\nHis presence beyond the material sky, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the\nless intelligent cannot realize Him as the Supreme Person. Certainly the\ntranscendental body of \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not perishable. He is just like the sun, and\nmay\u0101 is like the cloud. In the material world we can see that there is the sun\nand that there are clouds and different stars and planets. The clouds may cover\nall these in the sky temporarily, but this covering is only apparent to our\nlimited vision. The sun, moon and stars are not actually covered. Similarly,\nm\u0101y\u0101 cannot cover the Supreme Lord. By His internal potency He is not manifest\nto the less intelligent class of men. As it is stated in the third verse of this\nchapter, out of millions and millions of men, some try to become perfect in this\nhuman form of life, and out of thousands and thousands of such perfected men,\nhardly one can understand what Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is. Even if one is perfected by\nrealization of impersonal Brahman or localized Param\u0101tm\u0101, he cannot possibly\nunderstand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, without being in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness.",

For those who are sinful, atheistic, foolish and deceitful, it is\nvery difficult to transcend the duality of desire and hate. Only those who have\npassed their lives in practicing the regulative principles of religion, who have\nacted piously and have conquered sinful reactions can accept devotional service\nand gradually rise to the pure knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\nThen, gradually, they can meditate in trance on the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead.

The impersonalists do not know that forgetting their\nconstitutional position as subordinate to the Supreme Lord is the greatest\nviolation of God\u2019s law.

PURPORT  Persons acting in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness are never entirely deviated from the path\nof understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the transcendental\nassociation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, one can understand how the Supreme Lord is\nthe governing principle of the material manifestation and even of the demigods.\nGradually, by such transcendental association, one becomes convinced of the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead Himself, and at the time of death such a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconscious person can never forget K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Naturally he is thus promoted to the\nplanet of the Supreme Lord, Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana.  This Seventh Chapter particularly explains how one can become a fully K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconscious person. The beginning of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is association of persons\nwho are K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious. Such association is spiritual and puts one directly in\ntouch with the Supreme Lord, and, by His grace, one can understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to be\nthe Supreme God. At the same time one can really understand the constitutional\nposition of the living entity and how the living entity forgets K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and\nbecomes entangled in material activities. By gradual development of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness in good association, the living entity can understand that due to\nforgetfulness of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a he has become conditioned by the laws of material nature.\nHe can also understand that this human form of life is an opportunity to regain\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and that it should be fully utilized to attain the causeless\nmercy of the Supreme Lord.  Many subjects have been discussed in this chapter: the man in distress, the\ninquisitive man, the man in want of material necessities, knowledge of Brahman,\nknowledge of Param\u0101tm\u0101, liberation from birth, death and diseases, and worship\nof the Supreme Lord. However, he who is actually elevated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness\ndoes not care for the different processes. He simply directly engages himself in\nactivities of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and thereby factually attains his\nconstitutional position as eternal servitor of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In such a situation\nhe takes pleasure in hearing and glorifying the Supreme Lord in pure devotional\nservice. He is convinced that by doing so, all his objectives will be fulfilled.\nThis determined faith is called d\u1e5b\u1e0dha-vrata, and it is the beginning of\nbhakti-yoga or transcendental loving service. That is the verdict of all\nscriptures. This Seventh Chapter of the G\u012bt\u0101 is the substance of that\nconviction.",

What is the self?\nWhat are fruitive activities? What is this material manifestation? And what are\nthe demigods? Please explain this to me.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nIn this chapter Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a answers these different questions of Arjuna beginning\nwith, \u201cWhat is Brahman?\u201d The Lord also explains karma, fruitive activities,\ndevotional service and yoga principles, and devotional service in its pure form.\nThe \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam explains that the Supreme Absolute Truth is known as\nBrahman, Param\u0101tm\u0101, and Bhagav\u0101n. In addition, the living entity, individual\nsoul, is also called Brahman. Arjuna also inquires about \u0101tm\u0101, which refers to\nbody, soul and mind. According to the Vedic dictionary, \u0101tm\u0101 refers to the mind,\nsoul, body and senses also.\n\n\nArjuna has addressed the Supreme Lord as Puru\u1e63ottama, Supreme Person, which\nmeans that he was putting these questions not simply to a friend but to the\nSupreme Person, knowing Him to be the supreme authority able to give definitive\nanswers.\n\n\n8.2\n\n\nadhiyaj\u00f1a\u1e25 katha\u1e41 ko \u2019tra\n\n\ndehe \u2019smin madhus\u016bdana\n\n\npray\u0101\u1e47a-k\u0101le ca katha\u1e41\n\n\nj\u00f1eyo \u2019si niyat\u0101tmabhi\u1e25\n\n\nadhiyaj\u00f1a\u1e25\u2014the Lord of sacrifice; katham\u2014how; ka\u1e25\u2014who; atra\u2014here; dehe\u2014in the\nbody; asmin\u2014in this; madhus\u016bdana\u2014O Madhus\u016bdana; pray\u0101\u1e47a-k\u0101le\u2014at the time of\ndeath; ca\u2014and; katham\u2014how; j\u00f1eya\u1e25\u2014be known; asi\u2014You can; niyata-\u0101tmabhi\u1e25\u2014by the\nself-controlled.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nHow does this Lord of sacrifice live in the body, and in which part does He\nlive, O Madhus\u016bdana? And how can those engaged in devotional service know You at\nthe time of death?\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe Lord of sacrifice accepts Indra and Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is the chief of the primal\ndemigods, including Brahm\u0101 and \u015aiva, and Indra is the chief of the\nadministrative demigods. Both Indra and Vi\u1e63\u1e47u are worshiped by yaj\u00f1a\nperformances. But here Arjuna asks who is actually the Lord of yaj\u00f1a\n(sacrifice), and how is the Lord residing within the body of the living entity.\n\n\nArjuna addresses the Lord as Madhus\u016bdana because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a once killed a demon named\nMadhu. Actually these questions, which are of the nature of doubts, should not\nhave arisen in the mind of Arjuna because Arjuna is a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious devotee.\nTherefore these doubts are like demons. Since K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is so expert in killing\ndemons, Arjuna here addresses Him as Madhus\u016bdana so that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a might kill the\ndemonic doubts that arise in Arjuna\u2019s mind.\n\n\nNow the word pray\u0101\u1e47a-k\u0101le in this verse is very significant because whatever we\ndo in life will be tested at the time of death. Arjuna fears that at the time of\ndeath, those who are in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness will forget the Supreme Lord because\nat such a time body functions are disrupted and the mind may be in a\npanic-stricken state. Therefore Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Kula\u015bekhara, a great devotee, prays,\n\u201cMy dear Lord, may I die immediately now that I\u2019m healthy so that the swan of my\nmind may enter into the stem of Thy lotus feet.\u201d This metaphor is used because\nthe swan often takes pleasure in entering the stem of the lotus\nflower-similarly, the mind of the pure devotee is drawn to the lotus feet of the\nLord. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Kula\u015bekhara fears that at the moment of death his throat will be\nso choked up that he will not be able to chant the holy names, so it is better\nto \u201cdie immediately.\u201d Arjuna questions how one\u2019s mind can remain fixed on\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s lotus feet at such times.\n\n\n8.3\n\n\n\u015br\u012b-bhagav\u0101n uv\u0101ca\n\n\nak\u1e63ara\u1e41 brahma parama\u1e41\n\n\nsvabh\u0101vo \u2019dhy\u0101tmam ucyate\n\n\nbh\u016bta-bh\u0101vodbhava-karo\n\n\nvisarga\u1e25 karma-sa\u1e41j\u00f1ita\u1e25\n\n\n\u015br\u012b bhagav\u0101n uv\u0101ca\u2014the Supreme Personality of Godhead said;\nak\u1e63aram\u2014indestructible; brahma\u2014Brahman; paramam\u2014transcendental;\nsvabh\u0101va\u1e25\u2014eternal nature; adhy\u0101tmam\u2014the self; ucyate\u2014is called;\nbh\u016bta-bh\u0101va-udbhava-kara\u1e25\u2014action producing the material bodies of the living\nentities; visarga\u1e25\u2014creation; karma\u2014fruitive activities; sa\u1e41j\u00f1ita\u1e25\u2014is called.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThe Supreme Lord said, The indestructible, transcendental living entity is\ncalled Brahman, and his eternal nature is called the self. Action pertaining to\nthe development of these material bodies is called karma, or fruitive\nactivities.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nBrahman is indestructible and eternally existing, and its constitution is not\nchanged at any time. But beyond Brahman there is Parabrahman. Brahman refers to\nthe living entity, and Parabrahman refers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\nThe constitutional position of the living entity is different from the position\nhe takes in the material world. In material consciousness, his nature is to try\nto be the lord of matter, but in spiritual (K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a) consciousness, his position\nis to serve the Supreme. When the living entity is in material consciousness, he\nhas to take on various bodies in the material world. That is called karma, or\nvaried creation by the force of material consciousness.\n\n\nIn Vedic literature the living entity is called j\u012bv\u0101tm\u0101 and Brahman, but he is\nnever called Parabrahman. The living entity (j\u012bv\u0101tm\u0101) takes different\npositions\u2014sometimes he merges into the dark material nature and identifies\nhimself with matter, and sometimes he identifies himself with the superior\nspiritual nature. Therefore he is called the Supreme Lord\u2019s marginal energy.\nAccording to his identification with material or spiritual nature, he receives a\nmaterial or spiritual body. In material nature he may take a body from any of\nthe 8,400,000 species of life, but in spiritual nature he has only one body. In\nmaterial nature he is sometimes manifested as a man, demigod, an animal, a\nbeast, bird, etc., according to his karma. To attain material heavenly planets\nand enjoy their facilities, he sometimes performs sacrifices (yaj\u00f1a), but when\nhis merit is exhausted, he returns to earth again in the form of a man.\n\n\nln the process of sacrifice, the living entity makes specific sacrifices to\nattain specific heavenly planets and consequently reaches them. When the merit\nof sacrifice is exhausted, then the living entity descends to earth in the form\nof rain, then takes on the form of grains, and the grains are eaten by man and\ntransformed into semen, which impregnates a woman, and thus the living entity\nonce again attains the human form to perform sacrifice and so repeat the same\ncycle. In this way, the living entity perpetually comes and goes on the material\npath. The K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person, however, avoids such sacrifices. He takes\ndirectly to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and thereby prepares himself to return to\nGodhead.\n\n\nImpersonalist commentators on the G\u012bt\u0101 unreasonably assume that Brahman takes\nthe form of j\u012bva in the material world, and to substantiate this they refer to\nChapter Fifteen, verse 7, of the G\u012bt\u0101. But this verse also speaks of the living\nentity as \u201can eternal fragment of Myself.\u201d The fragment of God, the living\nentity, may fall down into the material world, but the Supreme Lord (Acyuta)\nnever falls down. Therefore this assumption that the Supreme Brahman assumes the\nform of j\u012bva is not acceptable. It is important to remember that in Vedic\nliterature Brahman (the living entity) is distinguished from Parabrahman (the\nSupreme Lord).\n\n\n8.4\n\n\nadhibh\u016bta\u1e41 k\u1e63aro bh\u0101va\u1e25\n\n\npuru\u1e63a\u015b c\u0101dhidaivatam\n\n\nadhiyaj\u00f1o \u2019ham ev\u0101tra\n\n\ndehe deha-bh\u1e5bt\u0101\u1e41 vara\n\n\nadhibh\u016btam\u2014the physical manifestation; k\u1e63ara\u1e25\u2014constantly changing;\nbh\u0101va\u1e25\u2014nature; puru\u1e63a\u1e25\u2014the universal form; ca\u2014and; adhidaivatam\u2014including all\ndemigods like the sun and moon; adhiyaj\u00f1a\u1e25\u2014the Supersoul; aham\u2014I (K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a);\neva\u2014certainly; atra\u2014in this; dehe\u2014body; deha-bh\u1e5bt\u0101m\u2014of the embodied; vara\u2014the\nSupreme.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nPhysical nature is known to be endlessly mutable. The universe is the cosmic\nform of the Supreme Lord, and I am that Lord represented as the Supersoul,\ndwelling in the heart of every embodied being.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe physical nature is constantly changing. Material bodies generally pass\nthrough six stages: they are born, they grow, they remain for some duration,\nthey produce some by-products, they dwindle, and then they vanish. This physical\nnature is called adhibh\u016btam. Because it is created at a certain point and will\nbe annihilated at a certain point, the conception of the universal form of the\nSupreme Lord that includes all the demigods and their different planets is\ncalled adhidaivatam. The individual soul (j\u012bva) accompanies the body. The\nSupersoul, a plenary representation of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is called the Param\u0101tm\u0101 or\nadhiyaj\u00f1a and is situated in the heart. The word eva is particularly important\nin the context of this verse because by this word the Lord stresses that the\nParam\u0101tm\u0101 is not different from Him. The Supersoul, the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead, seated beside the individual soul, is the witness of the individual\nsoul\u2019s activities and is the source of consciousness. The Supersoul gives the\nj\u012bva an opportunity to act freely, and He witnesses his activities. The\nfunctions of all these different manifestations of the Supreme Lord\nautomatically become clarified for the pure K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious devotee engaged in\ntranscendental service of the Lord. The gigantic universal form of the Lord\ncalled adhidaivatam is contemplated by the neophyte who cannot approach the\nSupreme Lord in His manifestation as Supersoul. The neophyte is advised to\ncontemplate the universal form whose legs are considered the lowet planets and\nwhose eyes are considered the sun and moon, and whose head is considered the\nupper planetary system.\n\n\n8.5\n\n\nanta-k\u0101le ca m\u0101m eva\n\n\nsmaran muktv\u0101 kalevaram\n\n\nya\u1e25 pray\u0101ti sa mad-bh\u0101va\u1e41\n\n\ny\u0101ti n\u0101sty atra sa\u1e41\u015baya\u1e25\n\n\nanta-k\u0101le\u2014at the end of life; ca\u2014also; m\u0101m\u2014unto Me; eva\u2014certainly;\nsmaran\u2014remembering; muktv\u0101\u2014quitting; kalevaram\u2014the body; ya\u1e25\u2014he who;\npray\u0101ti\u2014goes; sa\u1e25\u2014he; mad-bh\u0101vam\u2014My nature; yati\u2014achieves; na\u2014not; asti\u2014there\nis; atra\u2014here; sa\u1e41\u015baya\u1e25\u2014doubt.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nAnd whoever, at the time of death, quits his body, remembering Me alone, at once\nattains My nature. Of this there is no doubt.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nIn this verse the importance of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is stressed. Anyone who\nquits his body in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is at once transferred to the\ntranscendental abode of the Supreme Lord. The word smaran (remembering) is\nimportant. Remembrance of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not possible for the impure soul who has not\npracticed K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness in devotional service. To remember K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a one\nshould chant the mah\u0101mantra, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/\nHare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare, incessantly, following in the\nfootsteps of Lord Caitanya, being more tolerant than the tree, humbler than the\ngrass and offering all respect to others without requiring respect in return. In\nsuch a way one will be able to depart from the body successfully remembering\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and so attain the supreme goal.\n\n\n8.6\n\n\nya\u1e41 ya\u1e41 v\u0101pi smaran bh\u0101va\u1e41\n\n\ntyajaty ante kalevaram\n\n\nta\u1e41 tam evaiti kaunteya\n\n\nsad\u0101 tad-bh\u0101va-bh\u0101vita\u1e25\n\n\nyam yam\u2014whatever; v\u0101\u2014either; api\u2014also; smaran\u2014remembering; bh\u0101vam\u2014nature;\ntyajati\u2014give up; ante\u2014at the end; kalevaram\u2014this body; tam tam\u2014similar;\neva\u2014certainly; eti\u2014gets; kaunteya\u2014O son of Kunt\u012b; sad\u0101\u2014always; tat\u2014that;\nbh\u0101va\u2014state of being; bh\u0101vita\u1e25\u2014remembering.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nWhatever state of being one remembers when he quits his body, that state he will\nattain without fail.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe process of changing one\u2019s nature at the critical moment of death is here\nexplained. How can one die in the proper state of mind? Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Bharata thought\nof a deer at the time of death and so was transferred to that form of life.\nHowever, as a deer, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Bharata could remember his past activities. Of\ncourse the cumulative effect of the thoughts and actions of one\u2019s life\ninfluences one\u2019s thoughts at the moment of death; therefore the actions of this\nlife determine one\u2019s future state of being. If one is transcendentally absorbed\nin K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s service,then his next body will be transcendental (spiritual), not\nphysical. Therefore the chanting of Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the best process for\nsuccessfully changing one\u2019s state of being to transcendental life.\n\n\n8.7\n\n\ntasm\u0101t sarve\u1e63u k\u0101le\u1e63u\n\n\nm\u0101m anusmara yudhya ca\n\n\nmayy arpita-mano-buddhir\n\n\nm\u0101m evai\u1e63yasy asa\u1e41\u015baya\u1e25\n\n\ntasm\u0101t\u2014therefore; sarve\u1e63u\u2014always; k\u0101le\u1e63u\u2014time; m\u0101m\u2014unto Me; anusmara\u2014go on\nremembering; yudhya\u2014fight; ca\u2014also; mayi\u2014unto Me; arpita\u2014surrender; mana\u1e25\u2014mind;\nbuddhi\u1e25\u2014intellect; m\u0101m\u2014unto Me; eva\u2014surely; e\u1e63yasi\u2014will attain; asa\u1e41\u015baya\u1e25\u2014beyond\na doubt.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nTherefore, Arjuna, you should always think of Me in the form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and at the\nsame time carry out your prescribed duty of fighting. With your activities\ndedicated to Me and your mind and intelligence fixed on Me, you will attain Me\nwithout doubt.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThis instruction to Arjuna is very important for all men engaged in material\nactivities. The Lord does not say that one should give up his prescribed duties\nor engagements. One can continue them and at the same time think of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by\nchanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This will free one from material contamination and engage\nthe mind and intelligence in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. By chanting K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s names, one will be\ntransferred to the supreme planet, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aloka, without a doubt.\n\n\n8.8\n\n\nabhy\u0101sa-yoga-yuktena\n\n\ncetas\u0101 n\u0101nya-g\u0101min\u0101\n\n\nparama\u1e41 puru\u1e63a\u1e41 divya\u1e41\n\n\ny\u0101ti p\u0101rth\u0101nucintayan\n\n\nabhy\u0101sa\u2014practice; yoga-yuktena\u2014being engaged in meditation; cetas\u0101\u2014by the mind\nand intelligence; na anya-g\u0101min\u0101\u2014without being deviated; paramam\u2014the Supreme;\npuru\u1e63am\u2014Personality of Godhead; divyam\u2014transcendental; y\u0101ti\u2014achieves; p\u0101rtha\u2014O\nson of P\u1e5bth\u0101; anucintayan\u2014constantly thinking of.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nHe who meditates on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, his mind constantly\nengaged in remembering Me, undeviated from the path, he, O P\u0101rtha [Arjuna], is\nsure to reach Me.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nIn this verse Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a stresses the importance of remembering Him. One\u2019s\nmemory of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is revived by chanting the mah\u0101mantra, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. By this\npractice of chanting and hearing the sound vibration of the Supreme Lord, one\u2019s\near, tongue and mind are engaged. This mystic meditation is very easy to\npractice, and it helps one attain the Supreme Lord. Puru\u1e63am means enjoyer.\nAlthough living entities belong to the marginal energy of the Supreme Lord, they\nare in material contamination. They think themselves enjoyers, but they are not\nthe supreme enjoyer. Here it is clearly stated that the supreme enjoyer is the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead in His different manifestations and plenary\nexpansions as N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, V\u0101sudeva, etc.\n\n\nThe devotees can constantly think of the object of worship, the Supreme Lord, in\nany of His features, N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, R\u0101ma, etc., by chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This\npractice will purify him, and at the end of his life, due to his constant\nchanting, he will be transferred to the kingdom of God. Yoga practice is\nmeditation on the Supersoul within; similarly, by chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a one fixes\nhis mind always on the Supreme Lord. The mind is fickle, and therefore it is\nnecessary to engage the mind by force to think of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. One example often given\nis that of the caterpillar that thinks of becoming a butterfly and so is\ntransformed into a butterfly in the same life. Similarly, if we constantly think\nof K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, it is certain that at the end of our lives we shall have the same\nbodily constitution as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\n\n\n8.9\n\n\nkavi\u1e41 pur\u0101\u1e47am anu\u015b\u0101sit\u0101ram\n\n\na\u1e47or a\u1e47\u012by\u0101\u1e41sam anusmared ya\u1e25\n\n\nsarvasya dh\u0101t\u0101ram acintya-r\u016bpam\n\n\n\u0101ditya-var\u1e47a\u1e41 tamasa\u1e25 parast\u0101t\n\n\nkavim\u2014one who knows everything; pur\u0101\u1e47am\u2014the oldest; anu\u015b\u0101sit\u0101ram\u2014the controller;\na\u1e47o\u1e25\u2014of the atom; a\u1e47\u012by\u0101\u1e41sam\u2014smaller than; anusmaret\u2014always thinking; ya\u1e25\u2014one\nwho; sarvasya\u2014of everything; dh\u0101t\u0101ram\u2014maintainer; acintya\u2014inconceivable;\nr\u016bpam\u2014form; \u0101ditya-var\u1e47am\u2014illuminated like the sun; tamasa\u1e25\u2014of the darkness;\nparast\u0101t\u2014transcendental.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nOne should meditate upon the Supreme Person as the one who knows everything, as\nHe who is the oldest, who is the controller, who is smaller than the smallest,\nwho is the maintainer of everything, who is beyond all material conception, who\nis inconceivable, and who is always a person. He is luminous like the sun and,\nbeing transcendental, is beyond this material nature.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe process of thinking of the Supreme is mentioned in this verse. The foremost\npoint is that He is not impersonal or void. One cannot meditate on something\nimpersonal or void. That is very difficult. The process of thinking of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a,\nhowever, is very easy and is factually stated herein. First of all, He is\npuru\u1e63a, spiritual, R\u0101ma and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and is described herein as kavim; that is, He\nknows past, present and future and therefore knows everything. He is the oldest\npersonality because He is the origin of everything; everything is born out of\nHim. He is also the supreme controller of the universe, maintainer and\ninstructor of humanity. He is smaller than the smallest. The living entity is\none 10,000th part of the tip of a hair, but the Lord is so inconceivably small\nthat He enters into the heart of this particle. Therefore He is called smaller\nthan the smallest. As the Supreme, He can enter into the atom and into the heart\nof the smallest and control him as the Supersoul. Although so small, He is still\nall-pervading and is maintaining everything. By Him all these planetary systems\nare sustained. We often wonder how these big planets are floating in the air. It\nis stated here that the Supreme Lord, by His inconceivable energy, is sustaining\nall these big planets and systems of galaxies. The word acintya (inconceivable)\nis very significant in this connection. God\u2019s energy is beyond our conception,\nbeyond our thinking jurisdiction, and is therefore called inconceivable\n(acintya). Who can argue this point? He pervades this material world and yet is\nbeyond it. We cannot even comprehend this material world, which is insignificant\ncompared to the spiritual world\u2014so how can we comprehend what is beyond? Acintya\nmeans that which is beyond this material world, that which our argument, logic\nand philosophical speculation cannot touch, that which is inconceivable.\nTherefore intelligent persons, avoiding useless argument and speculation, should\naccept what is stated in scriptures like the Vedas, G\u012bt\u0101, and \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam\nand follow the principles they set down. This will lead one to understanding.\n\n\n8.10\n\n\npray\u0101\u1e47a-k\u0101le manas\u0101calena\n\n\nbhakty\u0101 yukto yoga-balena caiva\n\n\nbhruvor madhye pr\u0101\u1e47am \u0101ve\u015bya samyak\n\n\nsa ta\u1e41 para\u1e41 puru\u1e63am upaiti divyam\n\n\npray\u0101\u1e47a-k\u0101le\u2014at the time of death; manas\u0101\u2014by the mind; acalena\u2014without being\ndeviated; bhakty\u0101\u2014in full devotion; yukta\u1e25\u2014engaged; yoga-balena\u2014by the power of\nmystic yoga; ca\u2014also; eva\u2014certainly; bhruvo\u1e25\u2014between the two eyebrows;\nmadhye\u2014in; pr\u0101\u1e47am\u2014the life air; \u0101ve\u015bya\u2014establishing; samyak\u2014completely; sa\u1e25\u2014he;\ntam\u2014that; param\u2014transcendental; puru\u1e63am\u2014Personality of Godhead; upaiti\u2014achieves;\ndivyam\u2014in the spiritual kingdom.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nOne who, at the time of death, fixes his life air between the eyebrows and in\nfull devotion engages himself in remembering the Supreme Lord, will certainly\nattain to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nIn this verse it is clearly stated that at the time of death the mind must be\nfixed in devotion on the Supreme Godhead. For those practiced in yoga, it is\nrecommended that they raise the life force between the eyebrows, but for a pure\ndevotee who does not practice such yoga, the mind should always be engaged in\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness so that at death he can remember the Supreme by His grace.\nThis is explained in verse fourteen.\n\n\nThe particular use of the word yoga-balena is significant in this verse because\nwithout practice of yoga one cannot come to this transcendental state of being\nat the time of death. One cannot suddenly remember the Supreme Lord at death\nunless he is practiced in some yoga system, especially the system of\nbhakti-yoga. Since one\u2019s mind at death is very disturbed, one should practice\ntranscendence through yoga during one\u2019s life.\n\n\n8.11\n\n\nyad ak\u1e63ara\u1e41 veda-vido vadanti\n\n\nvi\u015banti yad yatayo v\u012bta-r\u0101g\u0101\u1e25\n\n\nyad icchanto brahmacarya\u1e41 caranti\n\n\ntat te pada\u1e41 sa\u1e45grahe\u1e47a pravak\u1e63ye\n\n\nyat\u2014that which; ak\u1e63aram\u2014inexhaustible; veda-vida\u1e25\u2014a person conversant with the\nVedas; vadanti\u2014say; vi\u015banti\u2014enters; yat\u2014in which; yataya\u1e25\u2014great sages;\nv\u012bta-r\u0101g\u0101h\u2014in the renounced order of life; yat\u2014that which; icchanta\u1e25\u2014desiring;\nbrahmacaryam\u2014celibacy; caranti\u2014practices; tat\u2014that; te\u2014unto you;\npadam\u2014situation; sa\u1e45grahe\u1e47a\u2014in summary; pravak\u1e63ye\u2014I shall explain.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nPersons learned in the Vedas, who utter omk\u0101ra and who are great sages in the\nrenounced order, enter into Brahman. Desiring such perfection, one practices\ncelibacy. I shall now explain to you this process by which one may attain\nsalvation.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nLord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a explains that Brahman, although one without a second, has different\nmanifestations and features. For the impersonalists, the syllable om is\nidentical with Brahman. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a here explains the impersonal Brahman in which the\nrenounced order of sages enter.\n\n\nIn the Vedic system of knowledge, students, from the very beginning, are taught\nto vibrate om and learn of the ultimate impersonal Brahman by living with the\nspiritual master in complete celibacy. In this way they realize two of Brahman\u2019s\nfeatures. This practice is very essential for the student\u2019s advancement in\nspiritual life, but at the moment such brahmac\u0101r\u012b (unmarried celibate) life is\nnot at all possible. The social construction of the world has changed so much\nthat there is no possibility of one\u2019s practicing celibacy from the beginning of\nstudent life. Throughout the world there are many institutions for different\ndepartments of knowledge, but there is no recognized institution where students\ncan be educated in the brahmac\u0101r\u012b principles. Unless one practices celibacy,\nadvancement in spiritual life is very difficult. Therefore Lord Caitanya has\nannounced, according to the scriptural injunctions for this age of Kali, that no\nprocess of realizing the Supreme is possible except the chanting of the holy\nname of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a: Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare, Hare R\u0101ma,\nHare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare.\n\n\n8.12\n\n\nsarva-dv\u0101r\u0101\u1e47i sa\u1e41yamya\n\n\nmano h\u1e5bdi nirudhya ca\n\n\nm\u016brdhny \u0101dh\u0101y\u0101tmana\u1e25 pr\u0101\u1e47am\n\n\n\u0101sthito yoga-dh\u0101ra\u1e47\u0101m\n\n\nsarva-dv\u0101r\u0101\u1e47i\u2014all the doors of the body; sa\u1e41yamya\u2014controlling; mana\u1e25\u2014mind;\nh\u1e5bdi\u2014in the heart; nirudhya\u2014confined; ca\u2014also; m\u016brdhni\u2014on the head;\n\u0101dh\u0101ya\u2014fixed; \u0101tmana\u1e25\u2014soul; pr\u0101\u1e47am\u2014the life air; \u0101sthita\u1e25\u2014situated;\nyoga-dh\u0101ra\u1e47\u0101m\u2014the yogic situation.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThe yogic situation is that of detachment from all sensual engagements. Closing\nall the doors of the senses and fixing the mind on the heart and the life air at\nthe top of the head, one establishes himself in yoga.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nTo practice yoga, as suggested here, one first has to close the door of all\nsense enjoyment. This practice is called praty\u0101h\u0101ra, or withdrawing the senses\nfrom the sense objects. Sense organs for acquiring knowledge, such as the eyes,\nears, nose, tongue and touch, should be fully controlled and should not be\nallowed to engage in self-gratification. In this way the mind focuses on the\nSupersoul in the heart and the life force is raised to the top of the head. In\nthe Sixth Chapter this process is described in detail. But as mentioned before,\nthis practice is not practical in this age. The best process is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness. If one is always able to fix his mind on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in devotional\nservice, it is very easy for him to remain in an undisturbed transcendental\ntrance, or in sam\u0101dhi.\n\n\n8.13\n\n\no\u1e41 ity ek\u0101k\u1e63ara\u1e41 brahma\n\n\nvy\u0101haran m\u0101m anusmaran\n\n\nya\u1e25 pray\u0101ti tyajan deha\u1e41\n\n\nsa y\u0101ti param\u0101\u1e41 gatim\n\n\nom\u2014the combination of letters, omk\u0101ra; iti\u2014thus; eka-ak\u1e63aram\u2014supreme,\nindestructible; brahma\u2014absolute; vy\u0101haran\u2014vibrating; m\u0101m\u2014Me (K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a);\nanusmaran\u2014remembering; ya\u1e25\u2014anyone; pray\u0101ti\u2014leaves; tyajan\u2014quitting; deham\u2014this\nbody; sa\u1e25\u2014he; y\u0101ti\u2014achieves; param\u0101m\u2014supreme; gatim\u2014destination.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nAfter being situated in this yoga practice and vibrating the sacred syllable om,\nthe supreme combination of letters, if one thinke of the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead and quits his body, he will certainly reach the spiritual planets.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nIt is clearly stated here that om, Brahman, and Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are not different.\nThe impersonal sound of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is om, but the sound Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a contains om. It is\nclearly recommended in this age that if one quits his body at the end of this\nlife chanting the mah\u0101mantra, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he will reach the spiritual planets.\nSimilarly, those who are devotees of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a enter the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a planet or Goloka\nV\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, whereas the impersonalists remain in the brahmajyoti.

The preceeding verses mention four different kinds of devotees\u2014the\ndistressed, the inquisitive, those who seek material gain, and the speculative\nphilosophers. Different processes of liberation from material entanglement have\nalso been described: karma-yoga, j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga, and ha\u1e6dha-yoga. But here\nbhakti-yoga, without any mixture of these, is mentioned. In bhakti-yoga the\ndevotees desire nothing but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The pure bhakti devotee does not desire\npromotion to heavenly planets, nor does he seek salvation or liberation from\nmaterial entanglement. A pure devotee does not desire anything. In the\nCaitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta the pure devotee is called ni\u1e63k\u0101ma, which means he has no\ndesire for self-interest. Perfect peace belongs to him alone, not to them who\nstrive for personal gain. The pure devotee only wants to please the Supreme\nLord, and so the Lord says that for anyone who is unflinchingly devoted to Him,\nHe is easy to attain. The devotee can render service to any of the\ntranscendental forms of the Supreme Lord, and he meets with none of the problems\nthat plague the practitioners of other yogas. Bhakti-yoga is very simple and\npure and easy to perform. One can begin by simply chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is\nvery merciful to those who engage in His service, and He helps in various ways\nthat devotee who is fully surrendered to Him so he can understand Him as He is.\nThe Lord gives such a devotee sufficient intelligence so that ultimately the\ndevotee can attain Him in His spiritual kingdom.\n\n\nThe special qualification of the pure devotee is that he is always thinking of\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a without considering the time or place. There should be no impediments. He\nshould be able to carry out his service anywhere and at any time. Some say that\nthe devotee should remain in holy places like V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana or some holy town where\nthe Lord lived, but a pure devotee can live anywhere and create the atmosphere\nof V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana by his devotional service. It was \u015ar\u012b Advaita who told Lord\nCaitanya, \u201cWherever You are, O Lord\u2014there is V\u1e5bndavana.\u201d\n\n\nA pure devotee constantly remembers K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and meditates upon Him. These are\nqualifications of the pure devotee for whom the Lord is most easily attainable.\nBhakti-yoga is the system that the G\u012bt\u0101 recommends above all others. Generally,\nthe bhakti-yog\u012bs are engaged in five different ways: 1) \u015b\u0101nta-bhakta, engaged in\ndevotional service in neutrality; 2) d\u0101sya-bhakta, engaged in devotional service\nas servant; 3) s\u0101khya-bhakta, engaged as friend; 4) v\u0101tsalya-bhakta, engaged as\nparent; and 5) m\u0101dhurya-bhakta, engaged as conjugal lover of the Supreme Lord.\nIn any of these ways, the pure devotee is always constantly engaged in the\ntranscendental loving service of the Supreme Lord and cannot forget the Supreme\nLord, and so for him the Lord is easily attained. A pure devotee cannot forget\nthe Supreme Lord for a moment, and similarly, the Supreme Lord cannot forget His\npure devotee for a moment. This is the great blessing of the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious\nprocess of chanting the mah\u0101mantra, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\n\n\n8.15\n\n\nm\u0101m upetya punar janma\n\n\ndu\u1e25kh\u0101layam a\u015b\u0101\u015bvatam\n\n\nn\u0101pnuvanti mah\u0101tm\u0101na\u1e25\n\n\nsa\u1e41siddhi\u1e41 param\u0101\u1e41 gat\u0101\u1e25\n\n\nm\u0101m\u2014unto Me; upetya\u2014achieving; puna\u1e25\u2014again; janma\u2014birth; du\u1e25kha-\u0101layam\u2014place of\nmiseries; a\u015b\u0101\u015bvatam\u2014temporary; na\u2014never; \u0101pnuvanti\u2014attain; mah\u0101tm\u0101na\u1e25\u2014the great\nsouls; sa\u1e41siddhim\u2014perfection; param\u0101m\u2014ultimate; gat\u0101\u1e25\u2014achieved.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nAfter attaining Me, the great souls, who are yog\u012bs in devotion, never return to\nthis temporary world, which is full of miseries, because they have attained the\nhighest perfection.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nSince this temporary material world is full of the miseries of birth, old age,\ndisease and death, naturally he who achieves the highest perfection and attains\nthe supreme planet, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aloka, Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, does not wish to return. The\nsupreme planet is described in Vedic literature as beyond our material vision,\nand it is considered the highest goal. The mah\u0101tm\u0101s (great souls) receive\ntranscendental messages from the realized devotees and thus gradually develop\ndevotional service in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and become so absorbed in\ntranscendental service that they no longer desire elevation to any of the\nmaterial planets, nor do they even want to be transferred to any spiritual\nplanet. They only want K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s association and nothing else. Such great souls in\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness attain the highest perfection of life.

Those who attain the highest\nmaterial planets or the planets of the demigods are again subjected to repeated\nbirth and death. As persons on earth are elevated to higher planets, people in\nhigher planets such as Brahmaloka, Candraloka and Indraloka fall down to earth.\nThe practice of sacrifice called pa\u00f1c\u0101gni-vidy\u0101, recommended in the Ka\u1e6dha\nUpani\u1e63ad, enables one to achieve Brahmaloka, but if, in Brahmaloka, one does not\ncultivate K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, then he must return to earth. Those who progress\nin K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness in the higher planets are gradually elevated to higher\nand higher planets and at the time of universal devastation are transferred to\nthe eternal spiritual kingdom. When there is devastation of this material\nuniverse, Brahm\u0101 and his devotees, who are constantly engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness, are all transferred to the spiritual universe and to specific\nspiritual planets according to their desires.\n\n\n8.17\n\n\nsahasra-yuga-paryantam\n\n\nahar yad brahma\u1e47o vidu\u1e25\n\n\nr\u0101tri\u1e41 yuga-sahasr\u0101nt\u0101\u1e41\n\n\nte \u2019ho-r\u0101tra-vido jan\u0101\u1e25\n\n\nsahasra\u2014thousand; yuga\u2014millenniums; prayantam\u2014including; aha\u1e25\u2014day; yat\u2014that;\nbrahma\u1e47a\u1e25\u2014of Brahm\u0101; vidu\u1e25\u2014know it; r\u0101trim\u2014night; yuga\u2014millenniums;\nsahasra-ant\u0101m\u2014similarly, at the end of one thousand; te\u2014that; aha\u1e25-r\u0101tra\u2014day and\nnight; vida\u1e25\u2014understand; jan\u0101\u1e25\u2014people.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nBy human calculation, a thousand ages taken together is the duration of Brahm\u0101\u2019s\none day. And such also is the duration of his night.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe duration of the material universe is limited. It is manifested in cycles of\nkalpas. A kalpa is a day of Brahm\u0101, and one day of Brahm\u0101 consists of a thousand\ncycles of four yugas or ages: Satya, Tret\u0101, Dv\u0101para, and Kali. The cycle of\nSatya is characterized by virtue, wisdom and religion, there being practically\nno ignorance and vice, and the yuga lasts 1,728,000 years. In the Tret\u0101-yuga\nvice is introduced, and this yuga lasts 1,296,000 years. In the Dv\u0101para-yuga\nthere is an even greater decline in virtue and religion, vice increasing, and\nthis yuga lasts 864,000 years. And finally in Kali-yuga (the yuga we have now\nbeen experiencing over the past 5,000 years) there is an abundance of strife,\nignorance, irreligion and vice, true virtue being practically nonexistent, and\nthis yuga lasts 432,000 years. In Kali-yuga vice increases to such a point that\nat the termination of the yuga the Supreme Lord Himself appears as the Kalki\navatara, vanquishes the demons, saves His devotees, and commences another\nSatya-yuga. Then the process is set rolling again. These four yugas, rotating a\nthousand times, comprise one day of Brahm\u0101, the creator god, and the same number\ncomprise one night. Brahm\u0101 lives one hundred of such \u201cyears\u201d and then dies.\nThese \u201chundred years\u201d by earth calculations total to 311 trillion and 40 million\nearth years. By these calculations the life of Brahm\u0101 seems fantastic and\ninterminable, but from the viewpoint of eternity it is as brief as a lightning\nflash. In the causal ocean there are innumerable Brahm\u0101s rising and disappearing\nlike bubbles in the Atlantic. Brahm\u0101 and his creation are all part of the\nmaterial universe, and therefore they are in constant flux.\n\n\nIn the material universe not even Brahm\u0101 is free from the process of birth, old\nage, disease and death. Brahm\u0101, however, is directly engaged in the service of\nthe Supreme Lord in the management of this universe\u2014therefore he at once attains\nliberation.

During the\ndaytime of Brahm\u0101 they exhibit their activities, and at the coming of Brahm\u0101\u2019s\nnight they are annihilated. In the day they receive various bodies for material\nactivities, and at night these bodies perish. The j\u012bvas (individual souls)\nremain compact in the body of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u and again and again are manifest at the\narrival of Brahm\u0101\u2019s day.

That is My supreme abode.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe supreme abode of the Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is described in the\nBrahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 as cint\u0101ma\u1e47i-dh\u0101ma, a place where all desires are fulfilled. The\nsupreme abode of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a known as Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana is full of palaces made of\ntouchstone. There are also trees which are called \u201cdesire trees\u201d that supply any\ntype of eatable upon demand, and there are cows known as surabhi cows which\nsupply a limitless supply of milk. In this abode, the Lord is served by hundreds\nof thousands of goddesses of fortune (Lak\u1e63m\u012bs), and He is called Govinda, the\nprimal Lord and the cause of all causes. The Lord is accustomed to blow His\nflute (venum kvanantam). His transcendental form is the most attractive in all\nthe worlds\u2014His eyes are like the lotus petals and the color of His body like\nclouds. He is so attractive that His beauty excels that of thousands of cupids.\nHe wears saffron cloth, a garland around His neck and a peacock feather in His\nhair. In the G\u012bt\u0101 Lord Kr\u1e63\u1e47a gives only a small hint of His personal abode\n(Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana) which is the supermost planet in the spiritual kingdom. A\nvivid description is given in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101. Vedic literature states that\nthere is nothing superior to the abode of the Supreme Godhead, and that that\nabode is the ultimate destination. When one attains to it, he never returns to\nthe material world. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s supreme abode and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself are nondifferent,\nbeing of the same quality. On this earth, V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, ninety miles southeast of\nDelhi, is a replica of that supreme Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana located in the spiritual\nsky. When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a descended on this earth, He sported on that particular tract of\nland known as V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana in the district of Mathur\u0101, India.\n\n\n8.22\n\n\npuru\u1e63a\u1e25 sa para\u1e25 p\u0101rtha\n\n\nbhakty\u0101 labhyas tv ananyay\u0101\n\n\nyasy\u0101nta\u1e25-sth\u0101ni bh\u016bt\u0101ni\n\n\nyena sarvam ida\u1e41 tatam\n\n\npuru\u1e63a\u1e25\u2014the Supreme Personality; sa\u1e25\u2014He; para\u1e25\u2014the Supreme, than whom no one is\ngreater; p\u0101rtha\u2014O son of P\u1e5bth\u0101; bhakty\u0101\u2014by devotional service; labhya\u1e25\u2014can be\nachieved; tu\u2014but; ananyay\u0101\u2014unalloyed, undeviating devotion; yasya\u2014His;\nanta\u1e25sth\u0101ni\u2014within; bh\u016bt\u0101ni\u2014all this material manifestation; yena\u2014by whom;\nsarvam\u2014all; idam\u2014whatever we can see; tatam\u2014distributed.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThe Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is greater than all, is attainable by\nunalloyed devotion. Although He is present in His abode, He is all-pervading,\nand everything is situated within Him.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nIt is here clearly stated that the supreme destination from which there is no\nreturn is the abode of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Person. The Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 describes\nthis supreme abode as \u0101nanda-cinmaya-rasa, a place where everything is full of\nspiritual bliss. Whatever variegatedness is manifest there is all of the quality\nof spiritual bliss\u2014there is nothing material. All variegatedness is expanded as\nthe spiritual expansion of the Supreme Godhead Himself, for the manifestation\nthere is totally of the spiritual energy, as explained in Chapter Seven. As far\nas this material world is concerned, although the Lord is always in His supreme\nabode, He is nonetheless all-pervading by His material energy. So by His\nspiritual and material energies He is present everywhere\u2014both in the material\nand in the spiritual universes. Yasy\u0101nta\u1e25sth\u0101ni means that everything is\nsustained by Him, whether it be spiritual or material energy.\n\n\nIt is clearly stated here that only by bhakti, or devotional service, can one\nenter into the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha (spiritual) planetary system. In all the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhas\nthere is only one Supreme Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who has expanded Himself into millions\nand millions of plenary expansions. These plenary expansions are four-armed, and\nthey preside over the innumerable spiritual planets. They are known by a variety\nof names\u2014Puru\u1e63ottama, Trivikrama, Ke\u015bava, M\u0101dhava, Aniruddha, H\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba,\nSa\u1e45kar\u1e63a\u1e47a, Pradyumna, \u015ar\u012bdhara, V\u0101sudeva, D\u0101modara, Jan\u0101rdana, N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a,\nV\u0101mana, Padman\u0101bha, etc. These plenary expansions are likened unto the leaves of\na tree, and the main tree is likened to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, dwelling in Goloka\nV\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, His supreme abode, systematically conducts all affairs of both\nuniverses (material and spiritual) without a flaw by power of His\nall-pervasiveness.\n\n\n8.23\n\n\nyatra k\u0101le tv an\u0101v\u1e5bttim\n\n\n\u0101v\u1e5btti\u1e41 caiva yogina\u1e25\n\n\npray\u0101t\u0101 y\u0101nti ta\u1e41 k\u0101la\u1e41\n\n\nvak\u1e63y\u0101mi bharatar\u1e63abha\n\n\nyatra\u2014in that; k\u0101le\u2014time; tu\u2014but; an\u0101v\u1e5bttim\u2014no return; \u0101v\u1e5bttim\u2014return; ca\u2014also;\neva\u2014certainly; yogina\u1e25\u2014of different kinds of mystics; pray\u0101t\u0101\u1e25\u2014one who goes;\ny\u0101nti\u2014departs; tam\u2014that; k\u0101lam\u2014time; vak\u1e63y\u0101mi\u2014describing; bharatar\u1e63abha\u2014O best\nof the Bh\u0101ratas.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nO best of the Bh\u0101ratas, I shall now explain to you the different times at which,\npassing away from this world, one does or does not come back.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe unalloyed devotees of the Supreme Lord who are totally surrendered souls do\nnot care when they leave their bodies or by what method. They leave everything\nin K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s hands and so easily and happily return to Godhead. But those who are\nnot unalloyed devotees and who depend instead on such methods of spiritual\nrealization as karma-yoga, j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga, ha\u1e6dha-yoga, etc., must leave the body at\na suitable time and thereby be assured whether or not they will return to the\nworld of birth and death.\n\n\nIf the yog\u012b is perfect, he can select the time and place for leaving this\nmaterial world, but if he is not so perfect, then he has to leave at nature\u2019s\nwill. The most suitable time to leave the body and not return is being explained\nby the Lord in these verses.

At the time of death, the j\u012bva sets forth on the path to a\nnew life. If one leaves the body at the time designated above, either accidently\nor by arrangement, it is possible for him to attain the impersonal brahmajyoti.\nMystics who are advanced in yoga practice can arrange the time and place to\nleave the body. Others have no control\u2014if by accident they leave at an\nauspicious moment, then they will not return to the cycle of birth and death,\nbut if not, then there is every possibility that they will have to return.\nHowever, for the pure devotee in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, there is no fear of\nreturning, whether he leaves the body at an auspicious or inauspicious moment,\nby accident or arrangement.\n\n\n8.25\n\n\ndh\u016bmo r\u0101tris tath\u0101 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u1e25\n\n\n\u1e63a\u1e47-m\u0101s\u0101 dak\u1e63i\u1e47\u0101yanam\n\n\ntatra c\u0101ndramasa\u1e41 jyotir\n\n\nyog\u012b pr\u0101pya nivartate\n\n\ndh\u016bma\u1e25\u2014smoke; r\u0101tri\u1e25\u2014night; tath\u0101\u2014also; k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u1e25\u2014the fortnight of the dark moon;\n\u1e63a\u1e6d-m\u0101s\u0101\u1e25\u2014the six months; dak\u1e63i\u1e47a-ayanam\u2014when the sun passes on the southern\nside; tatra\u2014there; c\u0101ndramasam\u2014the moon planet; jyoti\u1e25\u2014light, yog\u012b\u2014the mystic;\npr\u0101pya\u2014achieves; nivartate\u2014comes back.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThe mystic who passes away from this world during the smoke, the night, the\nmoonlight fortnight, or in the six months when the sun passes to the south, or\nwho reaches the moon planet, again comes back.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nIn the Third Canto of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam we are informed that those who are\nexpert in fruitive activities and sacrificial methods on earth attain to the\nmoon at death.

The devotee should be firmly established in Kr\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and\nchant Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He should know that concern over either of these two paths is\ntroublesome.

The word yoga-yukta is especially significant\nin this verse. One who is firm in yoga is constantly engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness in all his activities. \u015ar\u012b R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b advises that one should be\nunattached in the material world and that all affairs should be steeped in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness. In this way one attains perfection. Therefore the devotee is not\ndisturbed by these descriptions because he knows that his passage to the supreme\nabode is guaranteed by devotional service.\n\n\n8.28\n\n\nvede\u1e63u yaj\u00f1e\u1e63u tapa\u1e25su caiva\n\n\nd\u0101ne\u1e63u yat pu\u1e47ya-phala\u1e41 pradi\u1e63\u1e6dam\n\n\natyeti tat sarvam ida\u1e41 viditv\u0101\n\n\nyog\u012b para\u1e41 sth\u0101nam upaiti c\u0101dyam\n\n\nvede\u1e63u\u2014in the study of the Vedas; yaj\u00f1e\u1e63u\u2014in the performances of yaj\u00f1a,\nsacrifice; tapa\u1e25su\u2014undergoing different types of austerities; ca\u2014also;\neva\u2014certainly; d\u0101ne\u1e63u\u2014in giving charities; yat\u2014that which; pu\u1e47ya-phalam\u2014the\nresult of pious work; pradi\u1e63\u1e6dam\u2014directed; atyeti\u2014surpasses; tat\u2014all those;\nsarvam idam\u2014all those described above; viditv\u0101\u2014knowing; yog\u012b\u2014the devotee;\nparam\u2014supreme; sth\u0101nam\u2014abode; upaiti\u2014achieved peace; ca\u2014also; \u0101dyam\u2014original.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nA person who accepts the path of devotional service is not bereft of the results\nderived from studying the Vedas, performing austere sacrifices, giving charity\nor pursuing philosophical and fruitive activities. At the end he reaches the\nsupreme abode.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThis verse is the summation of the Seventh and Eighth Chapters, particularly as\nthe chapters deal with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and devotional service. One has to\nstudy the Vedas under the guidance of the spiritual master and undergo many\nausterities and penances while living under his care. A brahmac\u0101r\u012b has to live\nin the home of the spiritual master just like a servant, and he must beg alms\nfrom door to door and bring them to the spiritual master. He takes food only\nunder the master\u2019s order, and if the master neglects to call the student for\nfood that day, the student fasts. These are some of the Vedic principles for\nobserving brahmacarya.\n\n\nAfter the student studies the Vedas under the master for a period from five to\ntwenty years, he may become a man of perfect character. Study of the Vedas is\nnot meant for the recreation of armchair speculators, but for the formation of\ncharacter. After this training, the brahmac\u0101r\u012b is allowed to enter into\nhousehold life and marry. When he is a householder, he also has to perform many\nsacrifices and strive for further enlightenment. Then after retiring from\nhousehold life, upon accepting the order of v\u0101naprastha, he undergoes severe\npenances, such as living in forests, dressing with tree bark, not shaving, etc.\nBy carrying out the orders of brahmac\u0101r\u012b, householder, v\u0101naprastha and finally\nsanny\u0101sa, one becomes elevated to the perfectional stage of life. Some are then\nelevated to the heavenly kingdoms, and when they become even more advanced they\nare liberated in the spiritual sky, either in the impersonal brahmajyoti or in\nthe Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aloka. This is the path outlined by Vedic\nliteratures.\n\n\nThe beauty of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, however, is that by one stroke, by engaging\nin devotional service, one can surpass all rituals of the different orders of\nlife.\n\n\nOne should try to understand the Seventh and Eighth Chapters of the G\u012bt\u0101 not by\nscholarship or mental speculation, but by hearing them in association with pure\ndevotees. Chapters Six through Twelve are the essence of the G\u012bt\u0101. If one is\nfortunate to understand the G\u012bt\u0101\u2014especially these middle six chapters\u2014in the\nassociation of devotees, then his life at once becomes glorified beyond all\npenances, sacrifices, charities, speculations, etc. One should hear the G\u012bt\u0101\nfrom the devotee because at the beginning of the Fourth Chapter it is stated\nthat the G\u012bta can only be perfectly understood by devotees. Hearing the G\u012bt\u0101\nfrom devotees, not from mental speculators, is called faith. Through association\nof devotees, one is placed in devotional service, and by this service K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s\nactivities, form, pastimes, name, etc., become clear, and all misgivings are\ndispelled. Then once doubts are removed, the study of the G\u012bt\u0101 becomes extremely\npleasurable, and one develops a taste and feeling for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. In\nthe advanced stage, one falls completely in love with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and that is the\nbeginning of the highest perfectional stage of life which prepares the devotee\u2019s\ntransferral to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s abode in the spiritual sky, Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, where the\ndevotee enters into eternal happiness.",

TRANSLATION  How does this Lord of sacrifice live in the body, and in which part does He\nlive, O Madhus\u016bdana? And how can those engaged in devotional service know You at\nthe time of death?  PURPORT  The Lord of sacrifice accepts Indra and Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is the chief of the primal\ndemigods, including Brahm\u0101 and \u015aiva, and Indra is the chief of the\nadministrative demigods. Both Indra and Vi\u1e63\u1e47u are worshiped by yaj\u00f1a\nperformances. But here Arjuna asks who is actually the Lord of yaj\u00f1a\n(sacrifice), and how is the Lord residing within the body of the living entity.  Arjuna addresses the Lord as Madhus\u016bdana because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a once killed a demon named\nMadhu. Actually these questions, which are of the nature of doubts, should not\nhave arisen in the mind of Arjuna because Arjuna is a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious devotee.\nTherefore these doubts are like demons. Since K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is so expert in killing\ndemons, Arjuna here addresses Him as Madhus\u016bdana so that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a might kill the\ndemonic doubts that arise in Arjuna\u2019s mind.  Now the word pray\u0101\u1e47a-k\u0101le in this verse is very significant because whatever we\ndo in life will be tested at the time of death. Arjuna fears that at the time of\ndeath, those who are in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness will forget the Supreme Lord because\nat such a time body functions are disrupted and the mind may be in a\npanic-stricken state. Therefore Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Kula\u015bekhara, a great devotee, prays,\n\u201cMy dear Lord, may I die immediately now that I\u2019m healthy so that the swan of my\nmind may enter into the stem of Thy lotus feet.\u201d This metaphor is used because\nthe swan often takes pleasure in entering the stem of the lotus\nflower-similarly, the mind of the pure devotee is drawn to the lotus feet of the\nLord. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Kula\u015bekhara fears that at the moment of death his throat will be\nso choked up that he will not be able to chant the holy names, so it is better\nto \u201cdie immediately.\u201d Arjuna questions how one\u2019s mind can remain fixed on\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s lotus feet at such times.",

TRANSLATION  The Supreme Lord said, The indestructible, transcendental living entity is\ncalled Brahman, and his eternal nature is called the self. Action pertaining to\nthe development of these material bodies is called karma, or fruitive\nactivities.  PURPORT  Brahman is indestructible and eternally existing, and its constitution is not\nchanged at any time. But beyond Brahman there is Parabrahman. Brahman refers to\nthe living entity, and Parabrahman refers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\nThe constitutional position of the living entity is different from the position\nhe takes in the material world. In material consciousness, his nature is to try\nto be the lord of matter, but in spiritual (K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a) consciousness, his position\nis to serve the Supreme. When the living entity is in material consciousness, he\nhas to take on various bodies in the material world. That is called karma, or\nvaried creation by the force of material consciousness.  In Vedic literature the living entity is called j\u012bv\u0101tm\u0101 and Brahman, but he is\nnever called Parabrahman. The living entity (j\u012bv\u0101tm\u0101) takes different\npositions\u2014sometimes he merges into the dark material nature and identifies\nhimself with matter, and sometimes he identifies himself with the superior\nspiritual nature. Therefore he is called the Supreme Lord\u2019s marginal energy.\nAccording to his identification with material or spiritual nature, he receives a\nmaterial or spiritual body. In material nature he may take a body from any of\nthe 8,400,000 species of life, but in spiritual nature he has only one body. In\nmaterial nature he is sometimes manifested as a man, demigod, an animal, a\nbeast, bird, etc., according to his karma. To attain material heavenly planets\nand enjoy their facilities, he sometimes performs sacrifices (yaj\u00f1a), but when\nhis merit is exhausted, he returns to earth again in the form of a man.  ln the process of sacrifice, the living entity makes specific sacrifices to\nattain specific heavenly planets and consequently reaches them. When the merit\nof sacrifice is exhausted, then the living entity descends to earth in the form\nof rain, then takes on the form of grains, and the grains are eaten by man and\ntransformed into semen, which impregnates a woman, and thus the living entity\nonce again attains the human form to perform sacrifice and so repeat the same\ncycle. In this way, the living entity perpetually comes and goes on the material\npath. The K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person, however, avoids such sacrifices. He takes\ndirectly to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and thereby prepares himself to return to\nGodhead.  Impersonalist commentators on the G\u012bt\u0101 unreasonably assume that Brahman takes\nthe form of j\u012bva in the material world, and to substantiate this they refer to\nChapter Fifteen, verse 7, of the G\u012bt\u0101. But this verse also speaks of the living\nentity as \u201can eternal fragment of Myself.\u201d The fragment of God, the living\nentity, may fall down into the material world, but the Supreme Lord (Acyuta)\nnever falls down. Therefore this assumption that the Supreme Brahman assumes the\nform of j\u012bva is not acceptable. It is important to remember that in Vedic\nliterature Brahman (the living entity) is distinguished from Parabrahman (the\nSupreme Lord).",

TRANSLATION  Physical nature is known to be endlessly mutable. The universe is the cosmic\nform of the Supreme Lord, and I am that Lord represented as the Supersoul,\ndwelling in the heart of every embodied being.  PURPORT  The physical nature is constantly changing. Material bodies generally pass\nthrough six stages: they are born, they grow, they remain for some duration,\nthey produce some by-products, they dwindle, and then they vanish. This physical\nnature is called adhibh\u016btam. Because it is created at a certain point and will\nbe annihilated at a certain point, the conception of the universal form of the\nSupreme Lord that includes all the demigods and their different planets is\ncalled adhidaivatam. The individual soul (j\u012bva) accompanies the body. The\nSupersoul, a plenary representation of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is called the Param\u0101tm\u0101 or\nadhiyaj\u00f1a and is situated in the heart. The word eva is particularly important\nin the context of this verse because by this word the Lord stresses that the\nParam\u0101tm\u0101 is not different from Him. The Supersoul, the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead, seated beside the individual soul, is the witness of the individual\nsoul\u2019s activities and is the source of consciousness. The Supersoul gives the\nj\u012bva an opportunity to act freely, and He witnesses his activities. The\nfunctions of all these different manifestations of the Supreme Lord\nautomatically become clarified for the pure K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious devotee engaged in\ntranscendental service of the Lord. The gigantic universal form of the Lord\ncalled adhidaivatam is contemplated by the neophyte who cannot approach the\nSupreme Lord in His manifestation as Supersoul. The neophyte is advised to\ncontemplate the universal form whose legs are considered the lowet planets and\nwhose eyes are considered the sun and moon, and whose head is considered the\nupper planetary system.",

Of\ncourse the cumulative effect of the thoughts and actions of one\u2019s life\ninfluences one\u2019s thoughts at the moment of death; therefore the actions of this\nlife determine one\u2019s future state of being.

TRANSLATION  He who meditates on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, his mind constantly\nengaged in remembering Me, undeviated from the path, he, O P\u0101rtha [Arjuna], is\nsure to reach Me.  PURPORT  In this verse Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a stresses the importance of remembering Him. One\u2019s\nmemory of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is revived by chanting the mah\u0101mantra, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. By this\npractice of chanting and hearing the sound vibration of the Supreme Lord, one\u2019s\near, tongue and mind are engaged. This mystic meditation is very easy to\npractice, and it helps one attain the Supreme Lord. Puru\u1e63am means enjoyer.\nAlthough living entities belong to the marginal energy of the Supreme Lord, they\nare in material contamination. They think themselves enjoyers, but they are not\nthe supreme enjoyer. Here it is clearly stated that the supreme enjoyer is the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead in His different manifestations and plenary\nexpansions as N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, V\u0101sudeva, etc.  The devotees can constantly think of the object of worship, the Supreme Lord, in\nany of His features, N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, R\u0101ma, etc., by chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This\npractice will purify him, and at the end of his life, due to his constant\nchanting, he will be transferred to the kingdom of God. Yoga practice is\nmeditation on the Supersoul within; similarly, by chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a one fixes\nhis mind always on the Supreme Lord. The mind is fickle, and therefore it is\nnecessary to engage the mind by force to think of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. One example often given\nis that of the caterpillar that thinks of becoming a butterfly and so is\ntransformed into a butterfly in the same life. Similarly, if we constantly think\nof K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, it is certain that at the end of our lives we shall have the same\nbodily constitution as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",

TRANSLATION  One should meditate upon the Supreme Person as the one who knows everything, as\nHe who is the oldest, who is the controller, who is smaller than the smallest,\nwho is the maintainer of everything, who is beyond all material conception, who\nis inconceivable, and who is always a person. He is luminous like the sun and,\nbeing transcendental, is beyond this material nature.  PURPORT  The process of thinking of the Supreme is mentioned in this verse. The foremost\npoint is that He is not impersonal or void. One cannot meditate on something\nimpersonal or void. That is very difficult. The process of thinking of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a,\nhowever, is very easy and is factually stated herein. First of all, He is\npuru\u1e63a, spiritual, R\u0101ma and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and is described herein as kavim; that is, He\nknows past, present and future and therefore knows everything. He is the oldest\npersonality because He is the origin of everything; everything is born out of\nHim. He is also the supreme controller of the universe, maintainer and\ninstructor of humanity. He is smaller than the smallest. The living entity is\none 10,000th part of the tip of a hair, but the Lord is so inconceivably small\nthat He enters into the heart of this particle. Therefore He is called smaller\nthan the smallest. As the Supreme, He can enter into the atom and into the heart\nof the smallest and control him as the Supersoul. Although so small, He is still\nall-pervading and is maintaining everything. By Him all these planetary systems\nare sustained. We often wonder how these big planets are floating in the air. It\nis stated here that the Supreme Lord, by His inconceivable energy, is sustaining\nall these big planets and systems of galaxies. The word acintya (inconceivable)\nis very significant in this connection. God\u2019s energy is beyond our conception,\nbeyond our thinking jurisdiction, and is therefore called inconceivable\n(acintya). Who can argue this point? He pervades this material world and yet is\nbeyond it. We cannot even comprehend this material world, which is insignificant\ncompared to the spiritual world\u2014so how can we comprehend what is beyond? Acintya\nmeans that which is beyond this material world, that which our argument, logic\nand philosophical speculation cannot touch, that which is inconceivable.\nTherefore intelligent persons, avoiding useless argument and speculation, should\naccept what is stated in scriptures like the Vedas, G\u012bt\u0101, and \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam\nand follow the principles they set down. This will lead one to understanding.",

PURPORT  In this verse it is clearly stated that at the time of death the mind must be\nfixed in devotion on the Supreme Godhead. For those practiced in yoga, it is\nrecommended that they raise the life force between the eyebrows, but for a pure\ndevotee who does not practice such yoga, the mind should always be engaged in\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness so that at death he can remember the Supreme by His grace.\nThis is explained in verse fourteen.  The particular use of the word yoga-balena is significant in this verse because\nwithout practice of yoga one cannot come to this transcendental state of being\nat the time of death. One cannot suddenly remember the Supreme Lord at death\nunless he is practiced in some yoga system, especially the system of\nbhakti-yoga. Since one\u2019s mind at death is very disturbed, one should practice\ntranscendence through yoga during one\u2019s life.",

TRANSLATION  Persons learned in the Vedas, who utter omk\u0101ra and who are great sages in the\nrenounced order, enter into Brahman. Desiring such perfection, one practices\ncelibacy. I shall now explain to you this process by which one may attain\nsalvation.  PURPORT  Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a explains that Brahman, although one without a second, has different\nmanifestations and features. For the impersonalists, the syllable om is\nidentical with Brahman. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a here explains the impersonal Brahman in which the\nrenounced order of sages enter.  In the Vedic system of knowledge, students, from the very beginning, are taught\nto vibrate om and learn of the ultimate impersonal Brahman by living with the\nspiritual master in complete celibacy. In this way they realize two of Brahman\u2019s\nfeatures. This practice is very essential for the student\u2019s advancement in\nspiritual life, but at the moment such brahmac\u0101r\u012b (unmarried celibate) life is\nnot at all possible. The social construction of the world has changed so much\nthat there is no possibility of one\u2019s practicing celibacy from the beginning of\nstudent life. Throughout the world there are many institutions for different\ndepartments of knowledge, but there is no recognized institution where students\ncan be educated in the brahmac\u0101r\u012b principles. Unless one practices celibacy,\nadvancement in spiritual life is very difficult. Therefore Lord Caitanya has\nannounced, according to the scriptural injunctions for this age of Kali, that no\nprocess of realizing the Supreme is possible except the chanting of the holy\nname of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a: Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare, Hare R\u0101ma,\nHare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare.",

TRANSLATION  The yogic situation is that of detachment from all sensual engagements. Closing\nall the doors of the senses and fixing the mind on the heart and the life air at\nthe top of the head, one establishes himself in yoga.  PURPORT  To practice yoga, as suggested here, one first has to close the door of all\nsense enjoyment. This practice is called praty\u0101h\u0101ra, or withdrawing the senses\nfrom the sense objects. Sense organs for acquiring knowledge, such as the eyes,\nears, nose, tongue and touch, should be fully controlled and should not be\nallowed to engage in self-gratification. In this way the mind focuses on the\nSupersoul in the heart and the life force is raised to the top of the head. In\nthe Sixth Chapter this process is described in detail. But as mentioned before,\nthis practice is not practical in this age. The best process is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness. If one is always able to fix his mind on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in devotional\nservice, it is very easy for him to remain in an undisturbed transcendental\ntrance, or in sam\u0101dhi.",

TRANSLATION  For one who remembers Me without deviation, I am easy to obtain, O son of P\u1e5bth\u0101,\nbecause of his constant engagement in devotional service.  PURPORT  ln this verse the bhakti-yoga of the unalloyed devotees of the Supreme Godhead\nis described. The preceeding verses mention four different kinds of devotees\u2014the\ndistressed, the inquisitive, those who seek material gain, and the speculative\nphilosophers. Different processes of liberation from material entanglement have\nalso been described: karma-yoga, j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga, and ha\u1e6dha-yoga. But here\nbhakti-yoga, without any mixture of these, is mentioned. In bhakti-yoga the\ndevotees desire nothing but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The pure bhakti devotee does not desire\npromotion to heavenly planets, nor does he seek salvation or liberation from\nmaterial entanglement. A pure devotee does not desire anything. In the\nCaitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta the pure devotee is called ni\u1e63k\u0101ma, which means he has no\ndesire for self-interest. Perfect peace belongs to him alone, not to them who\nstrive for personal gain. The pure devotee only wants to please the Supreme\nLord, and so the Lord says that for anyone who is unflinchingly devoted to Him,\nHe is easy to attain. The devotee can render service to any of the\ntranscendental forms of the Supreme Lord, and he meets with none of the problems\nthat plague the practitioners of other yogas. Bhakti-yoga is very simple and\npure and easy to perform. One can begin by simply chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is\nvery merciful to those who engage in His service, and He helps in various ways\nthat devotee who is fully surrendered to Him so he can understand Him as He is.\nThe Lord gives such a devotee sufficient intelligence so that ultimately the\ndevotee can attain Him in His spiritual kingdom.  The special qualification of the pure devotee is that he is always thinking of\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a without considering the time or place. There should be no impediments. He\nshould be able to carry out his service anywhere and at any time. Some say that\nthe devotee should remain in holy places like V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana or some holy town where\nthe Lord lived, but a pure devotee can live anywhere and create the atmosphere\nof V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana by his devotional service. It was \u015ar\u012b Advaita who told Lord\nCaitanya, \u201cWherever You are, O Lord\u2014there is V\u1e5bndavana.\u201d  A pure devotee constantly remembers K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and meditates upon Him. These are\nqualifications of the pure devotee for whom the Lord is most easily attainable.\nBhakti-yoga is the system that the G\u012bt\u0101 recommends above all others. Generally,\nthe bhakti-yog\u012bs are engaged in five different ways: 1) \u015b\u0101nta-bhakta, engaged in\ndevotional service in neutrality; 2) d\u0101sya-bhakta, engaged in devotional service\nas servant; 3) s\u0101khya-bhakta, engaged as friend; 4) v\u0101tsalya-bhakta, engaged as\nparent; and 5) m\u0101dhurya-bhakta, engaged as conjugal lover of the Supreme Lord.\nIn any of these ways, the pure devotee is always constantly engaged in the\ntranscendental loving service of the Supreme Lord and cannot forget the Supreme\nLord, and so for him the Lord is easily attained. A pure devotee cannot forget\nthe Supreme Lord for a moment, and similarly, the Supreme Lord cannot forget His\npure devotee for a moment. This is the great blessing of the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious\nprocess of chanting the mah\u0101mantra, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",

PURPORT  The duration of the material universe is limited. It is manifested in cycles of\nkalpas. A kalpa is a day of Brahm\u0101, and one day of Brahm\u0101 consists of a thousand\ncycles of four yugas or ages: Satya, Tret\u0101, Dv\u0101para, and Kali. The cycle of\nSatya is characterized by virtue, wisdom and religion, there being practically\nno ignorance and vice, and the yuga lasts 1,728,000 years. In the Tret\u0101-yuga\nvice is introduced, and this yuga lasts 1,296,000 years. In the Dv\u0101para-yuga\nthere is an even greater decline in virtue and religion, vice increasing, and\nthis yuga lasts 864,000 years. And finally in Kali-yuga (the yuga we have now\nbeen experiencing over the past 5,000 years) there is an abundance of strife,\nignorance, irreligion and vice, true virtue being practically nonexistent, and\nthis yuga lasts 432,000 years. In Kali-yuga vice increases to such a point that\nat the termination of the yuga the Supreme Lord Himself appears as the Kalki\navatara, vanquishes the demons, saves His devotees, and commences another\nSatya-yuga. Then the process is set rolling again. These four yugas, rotating a\nthousand times, comprise one day of Brahm\u0101, the creator god, and the same number\ncomprise one night. Brahm\u0101 lives one hundred of such \u201cyears\u201d and then dies.\nThese \u201chundred years\u201d by earth calculations total to 311 trillion and 40 million\nearth years. By these calculations the life of Brahm\u0101 seems fantastic and\ninterminable, but from the viewpoint of eternity it is as brief as a lightning\nflash. In the causal ocean there are innumerable Brahm\u0101s rising and disappearing\nlike bubbles in the Atlantic. Brahm\u0101 and his creation are all part of the\nmaterial universe, and therefore they are in constant flux.  In the material universe not even Brahm\u0101 is free from the process of birth, old\nage, disease and death.

The\nsupreme abode of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a known as Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana is full of palaces made of\ntouchstone.

TRANSLATION  A person who accepts the path of devotional service is not bereft of the results\nderived from studying the Vedas, performing austere sacrifices, giving charity\nor pursuing philosophical and fruitive activities. At the end he reaches the\nsupreme abode.  PURPORT  This verse is the summation of the Seventh and Eighth Chapters, particularly as\nthe chapters deal with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and devotional service. One has to\nstudy the Vedas under the guidance of the spiritual master and undergo many\nausterities and penances while living under his care. A brahmac\u0101r\u012b has to live\nin the home of the spiritual master just like a servant, and he must beg alms\nfrom door to door and bring them to the spiritual master. He takes food only\nunder the master\u2019s order, and if the master neglects to call the student for\nfood that day, the student fasts. These are some of the Vedic principles for\nobserving brahmacarya.  After the student studies the Vedas under the master for a period from five to\ntwenty years, he may become a man of perfect character. Study of the Vedas is\nnot meant for the recreation of armchair speculators, but for the formation of\ncharacter. After this training, the brahmac\u0101r\u012b is allowed to enter into\nhousehold life and marry. When he is a householder, he also has to perform many\nsacrifices and strive for further enlightenment. Then after retiring from\nhousehold life, upon accepting the order of v\u0101naprastha, he undergoes severe\npenances, such as living in forests, dressing with tree bark, not shaving, etc.\nBy carrying out the orders of brahmac\u0101r\u012b, householder, v\u0101naprastha and finally\nsanny\u0101sa, one becomes elevated to the perfectional stage of life. Some are then\nelevated to the heavenly kingdoms, and when they become even more advanced they\nare liberated in the spiritual sky, either in the impersonal brahmajyoti or in\nthe Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aloka. This is the path outlined by Vedic\nliteratures.  The beauty of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, however, is that by one stroke, by engaging\nin devotional service, one can surpass all rituals of the different orders of\nlife.  One should try to understand the Seventh and Eighth Chapters of the G\u012bt\u0101 not by\nscholarship or mental speculation, but by hearing them in association with pure\ndevotees. Chapters Six through Twelve are the essence of the G\u012bt\u0101. If one is\nfortunate to understand the G\u012bt\u0101\u2014especially these middle six chapters\u2014in the\nassociation of devotees, then his life at once becomes glorified beyond all\npenances, sacrifices, charities, speculations, etc. One should hear the G\u012bt\u0101\nfrom the devotee because at the beginning of the Fourth Chapter it is stated\nthat the G\u012bta can only be perfectly understood by devotees. Hearing the G\u012bt\u0101\nfrom devotees, not from mental speculators, is called faith. Through association\nof devotees, one is placed in devotional service, and by this service K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s\nactivities, form, pastimes, name, etc., become clear, and all misgivings are\ndispelled. Then once doubts are removed, the study of the G\u012bt\u0101 becomes extremely\npleasurable, and one develops a taste and feeling for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. In\nthe advanced stage, one falls completely in love with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and that is the\nbeginning of the highest perfectional stage of life which prepares the devotee\u2019s\ntransferral to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s abode in the spiritual sky, Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, where the\ndevotee enters into eternal happiness.",

This cannot be achieved by the association of mental speculators or\nacademic scholars, for it is realized knowledge.\u201d\n\n\nThe devotees are constantly engaged in the Supreme Lord\u2019s service. The Lord\nunderstands the mentality and sincerity of a particular living entity who is\nengaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and gives him the intelligence to understand the\nscience of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in the association of the devotees. Discussion of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is very\npotent, and if a fortunate person has such association and tries to assimilate\nthe knowledge, then he will surely make advancement toward spiritual\nrealization. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, in order to encourage Arjuna to higher and higher\nelevation in His potent service, describes in this Ninth Chapter matters more\nconfidential than any He has already disclosed.\n\n\nThe very beginning of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, the First Chapter, is more or less an\nintroduction to the rest of the book; and in the Second and Third Chapters, the\nspiritual knowledge described is called confidential. Topics discussed in the\nSeventh and Eighth Chapters are specifically related to devotional service, and\nbecause they bring enlightenment in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, they are called more\nconfidential. But the matters which are described in the Ninth Chapter deal with\nunalloyed, pure devotion. Therefore this is called the most confidential. One\nwho is situated in the most confidential knowledge of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is naturally\ntranscendental; he therefore has no material pangs, although he is in the\nmaterial world. In the Bhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu it is said that although one who\nhas a sincere desire to render loving service to the Supreme Lord is situated in\n\n\nthe conditional state of material existence, he is to be considered liberated.\nSimilarly, we shall find in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, Tenth Chapter, that anyone who is\nengaged in that way is a liberated person.\n\n\nNow this first verse has specific significance. Knowledge (ida\u1e41 j\u00f1\u0101nam) refers\nto pure devotional service, which consists of nine different activities:\nhearing, chanting, remembering, serving, worshiping, praying, obeying,\nmaintaining friendship and surrendering everything. By the practice of these\nnine elements of devotional service one is elevated to spiritual consciousness,\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. At the time when one\u2019s heart is cleared of the material\ncontamination, one can understand this science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Simply to understand\nthat a living entity is not material is not sufficient. That may be the\nbeginning of spiritual realization, but one should recognize the difference\nbetween activities of the body and spiritual activities by which one understands\nthat he is not the body.\n\n\nIn the Seventh Chapter we have already discussed the opulent potency of the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead, His different energies, the inferior and\nsuperior natures, and all this material manifestation. Now in Chapters Nine and\nTen the glories of the Lord will be delineated.\n\n\nThe Sanskrit word anas\u016byave in this verse is also very significant. Generally\nthe commentators, even if they are highly scholarly, are all envious of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a,\nthe Supreme Personality of Godhead. Even the most erudite scholars write on\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 very inaccurately. Because they are envious of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, their\ncommentaries are useless. The commentaries given by devotees of the Lord are\nbona fide. No one can explain Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, or give perfect knowledge of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nif he is envious. One who criticizes the character of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a without knowing Him\nis a fool. So such commentaries should be very carefully avoided. For one who\nunderstands that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the pure and\ntranscendental Personality, these chapters will be very beneficial.\n\n\n9.2\n\n\nr\u0101ja-vidy\u0101 r\u0101ja-guhya\u1e41\n\n\npavitram idam uttamam\n\n\npratyak\u1e63\u0101vagama\u1e41 dharmya\u1e41\n\n\nsu-sukha\u1e41 kartum avyayam\n\n\nr\u0101ja-vidy\u0101\u2014the king of education; r\u0101ja-guhyam\u2014the king of confidential\nknowledge; pavitram\u2014the purest; idam\u2014this; uttamam\u2014transcendental;\npratyak\u1e63a\u2014directly experienced; avagamam\u2014understood; dharmyam\u2014the principle of\nreligion; susukham\u2014very happy; kartum\u2014to execute; avyayam\u2014everlasting.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThis knowledge is the king of education, the most secret of all secrets. It is\nthe purest knowledge, and because it gives direct perception of the self by\nrealization, it is the perfection of religion. It is everlasting, and it is\njoyfully performed.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThis chapter of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is called the king of education because it is the\nessence of all doctrines and philosophies explained before. There are seven\nprincipal philosophers in India: Gautama, Ka\u1e47\u0101da, Kapila, Y\u0101j\u00f1avalkya, \u015a\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dilya,\nVai\u015bv\u0101nara, and, finally, Vy\u0101sadeva, the author of the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra. So there\nis no dearth of knowledge in the field of philosophy or transcendental\nknowledge. Now the Lord says that this Ninth Chapter is the king of all such\nknowledge, the essence of all knowledge that can be derived from the study of\nthe Vedas and different kinds of philosophy. It is the most confidential because\nconfidential or transcendental knowledge involves understanding the difference\nbetween the soul and the body. And the king of all confidential knowledge\nculminates in devotional service.\n\n\nGenerally, people are not educated in this confidential knowledge; they are\neducated in external knowledge. As far as ordinary education is concerned,\npeople are involved with so many departments: politics, sociology, physics,\nchemistry, mathematics, astronomy, engineering, etc. There are so many\ndepartments of knowledge all over the world and many huge universities, but\nthere is, unfortunately, no university or educational institution where the\nscience of the spirit soul is instructed. Yet the soul is the most important\npart of this body; without the presence of the soul, the body has no value.\nStill people are placing great stress on the bodily necessities of life, not\ncaring for the vital soul.\n\n\nThe Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, especially from the Second Chapter on, stresses the\nimportance of the soul. In the very beginning, the Lord says that this body is\nperishable and that the soul is not perishable. That is a confidential part of\nknowledge: simply knowing that spirit soul is different from this body and that\nits nature is immutable, indestructible and eternal. But that gives no positive\ninformation about the soul. Sometimes people are under the impression that the\nsoul is different from the body and that when the body is finished, or one is\nliberated from the body, the soul remains in a void and becomes impersonal. But\nactually that is not the fact. How can the soul, which is so active within this\nbody, be inactive after being liberated from the body? It is always active. If\nit is eternal, then it is eternally active, and its activities in the spiritual\nkingdom are the most confidential part of spiritual knowledge. These activities\nof the spirit soul are therefore indicated here as constituting the king of all\nknowledge, the most confidential part of all knowledge.\n\n\nThis knowledge is the purest form of all activities, as is explained in Vedic\nliterature. In the Padma Pur\u0101\u1e47a, man\u2019s sinful activities have been analyzed and\nare shown to be the results of sin after sin. Those who are engaged in fruitive\nactivities are entangled in different stages and forms of sinful reactions. For\ninstance, when the seed of a particular tree is sown, the tree does not appear\nimmediately to grow; it takes some time. It is first a small, sprouting plant,\nthen it assumes the form of a tree, then it flowers, bears fruit, and, when it\nis complete, the flowers and fruits are enjoyed by persons who have sown the\nseed of the tree. Similarly, a man performs a sinful act, and like a seed it\ntakes time to fructify. There are different stages. The sinful action may have\nalready stopped within the individual, but the results or the fruit of that\nsinful action are still enjoyed. There are sins which are still in the form of a\nseed, and there are others which are already fructified and are giving us fruit,\nwhich we are enjoying as distress and pain, as explained in the twentieth verse\nof the Seventh Chapter.\n\n\nA person who has completely ended the reactions of all sinful activities and who\nis fully engaged in pious activities, being freed from the duality of this\nmaterial world, becomes engaged in devotional service to the Supreme Personality\nof Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In other words, those who are actually engaged in the\ndevotional service of the Supreme Lord are already freed from all reactions. For\nthose who are engaged in the devotional service of the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead, all sinful reactions, whether fructified, in the stock, or in the form\nof a seed, gradually vanish. Therefore the purifying potency of devotional\nservice is very strong, and it is called pavitram uttamam, the purest. Uttamam\nmeans transcendental. Tamas means this material world or darkness, and uttamam\nmeans that which is transcendental to material activities. Devotional activities\nare never to be considered material, although sometimes it appears that devotees\nare engaged just like ordinary men. One who can see and is familiar with\ndevotional service, however, will know that they are not material activities.\nThey are all spiritual and devotional, uncontaminated by the material modes of\nnature.\n\n\nIt is said that the execution of devotional service is so perfect that one can\nperceive the results directly. This direct result is actually perceived, and we\nhave practical experience that any person who is chanting the holy names of\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma,\nR\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare) in course of time feels some transcendental pleasure and\nvery quickly becomes purified of all material contamination. This is actually\nseen. Furthermore, if one engages not only in hearing but in trying to broadcast\nthe message of devotional activities as well, or if he engages himself in\nhelping the missionary activities of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, he gradually feels\nspiritual progress. This advancement in spiritual life does not depend on any\nkind of previous education or qualification. The method itself is so pure that\nby simply engaging in it one becomes pure.\n\n\nIn the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra this is also described in the following words: prak\u0101\u015ba\u015b ca\nkarma\u1e47y abhy\u0101s\u0101t. \u201cDevotional service is so potent that simply by engaging in\nthe activities of devotional service, one becomes enlightened without a doubt.\u201d\nN\u0101rada, who happened to be the son of a maidservant, had no education, nor was\nhe born into a high family. But when his mother was engaged in serving great\ndevotees, N\u0101rada also became engaged, and sometimes, in the absence of his\nmother, he would serve the great devotees himself. N\u0101rada personally says, \u201cOnce\nonly, by their permission, I took the remnants of their food, and by so doing\nall my sins were at once eradicated. Thus being engaged, I became purified in\nheart, and at that time the very nature of the transcendentalist became\nattractive to me.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 1.5.25) N\u0101rada tells his disciple Vy\u0101sadeva that in a\nprevious life he was engaged as a boy servant of purified devotees during four\nmonths of their stay and that he was intimately associating with them. Sometimes\nthose sages left remnants of food on their dishes, and the boy, who would wash\ntheir dishes, wanted to taste the remnants. So he asked the great devotees\nwhether he could eat them, and they gave their permission. N\u0101rada then ate those\nremnants and consequently became freed from all sinful reactions. As he went on\neating, he gradually became as purehearted as the sages, and he gradually\ndeveloped the same taste. The great devotees relished the taste of unceasing\ndevotional service of the Lord, hearing, chanting, etc., and by developing the\nsame taste, N\u0101rada wanted also to hear and chant the glories of the Lord. Thus\nby associating with the sages, he developed a great desire for devotional\nservice. Therefore he quotes from the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra (prak\u0101\u015ba\u015b ca karma\u1e47y\nabhy\u0101s\u0101t): If one is engaged simply in the acts of devotional service,\neverything is revealed to him automatically, and he can understand. This is\ncalled prak\u0101\u015ba\u1e25, directly perceived.\n\n\nN\u0101rada was actually a son of a maidservant. He had no opportunity to go to\nschool. He was simply assisting his mother, and fortunately his mother rendered\nsome service to the devotees. The child N\u0101rada also got the opportunity and\nsimply by association achieved the highest goal of all religions, devotional\nservice. In the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam it is said that religious people generally do\nnot know that the highest perfection of religion is the attainment of the stage\nof devotional service. Generally Vedic knowledge is required for the\nunderstanding of the path of self-realization. But here, although he was not\neducated in the Vedic principle, N\u0101rada acquired the highest results of Vedic\nstudy. This process is so potent that even without performing the religious\nprocess regularly, one can be raised to the highest perfection. How is this\npossible? This is also confirmed in Vedic literature: \u0101c\u0101ryav\u0101n puru\u1e63o veda. One\nwho is in association with great \u0101c\u0101ryas, even if he is not educated or has not\nstudied the Vedas, can become familiar with all the knowledge necessary for\nrealization.\n\n\nThe process of devotional service is a very happy one. Why? Devotional service\nconsists of \u015brava\u1e47a\u1e41 k\u012brtana\u1e41 vi\u1e63\u1e47o\u1e25, so one can simply hear the chanting of the\nglories of the Lord or can attend philosophical lectures on transcendental\nknowledge given by authorized \u0101c\u0101ryas. Simply by sitting, one can learn; then\none can eat the remnants of the food offered to God, nice palatable dishes. In\nevery state devotional service is joyful. One can execute devotional service\neven in the most poverty-stricken condition. The Lord says, patra\u1e41 pu\u1e63pa\u1e41\nphalam: He is ready to accept from the devotee any kind of offering, never mind\nwhat. Even a leaf, a flower, a bit of fruit, or a little water, which are all\navailable in every part of the world, can be offered by any person, regardless\nof social position, and will be accepted if offered with love. There are many\ninstances in history. Simply by tasting the tulas\u012b leaves offered to the lotus\nfeet of the Lord, great sages like Sanatkum\u0101ra became great devotees. Therefore\nthe devotional process is very nice, and it can be executed in a happy mood. God\naccepts only the love with which things are offered to Him.\n\n\nIt is said here that this devotional service is eternally existing. It is not as\nthe M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophers claim. They sometimes take to so-called devotional\nservice, and as long as they are not liberated they continue their devotional\nservice, but at the end, when they become liberated, they \u201cbecome one with God.\u201d\nSuch temporary time-serving devotional service is not accepted as pure\ndevotional service. Actual devotional service continues even after liberation.\nWhen the devotee goes to the spiritual planet in the kingdom of God, he is also\nengaged there in serving the Supreme Lord. He does not try to become one with\nthe Supreme Lord.\n\n\nAs it will be seen, actual devotional service begins after liberation. So in\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 it is said, brahma-bh\u016bta. After being liberated, or being situated\nin the Brahman position, one\u2019s devotional service begins. By executing\ndevotional service, one can understand the Supreme Lord. No one can understand\nthe Supreme Personality of Godhead by executing karma-yoga, j\u00f1\u0101na, or\na\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45ga-yoga or any other yoga independantly. Without coming to the stage of\ndevotional service, one cannot understand what is the Personality of Godhead. In\nthe \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam it is also confirmed that when one becomes purified by\nexecuting the process of devotional service, especially by hearing\n\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam or Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 from realized souls, then he can understand\nthe science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or the science of God. Eva\u1e41 prasanna-manaso\nbhagavad-bhakti-yogata\u1e25. When one\u2019s heart is cleared of all nonsense, then one\ncan understand what God is. Thus the process of devotional service, of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness, is the king of all education and the king of all confidential\nknowledge. It is the purest form of religion, and it can be executed joyfully\nwithout difficulty. Therefore one should adopt it.\n\n\n9.3\n\n\na\u015braddadh\u0101n\u0101\u1e25 puru\u1e63\u0101\n\n\ndharmasy\u0101sya parantapa\n\n\napr\u0101pya m\u0101\u1e41 nivartante\n\n\nm\u1e5btyu-sa\u1e41s\u0101ra-vartmani\n\n\na\u015braddadh\u0101n\u0101\u1e25\u2014those who are faithless; puru\u1e63\u0101\u1e25\u2014such persons; dharmasya\u2014of this\nprocess of religion; asya\u2014of it; parantapa\u2014O killer of the enemies;\napr\u0101pya\u2014without obtaining; m\u0101m\u2014Me; nivartante\u2014come back; m\u1e5btyu\u2014death;\nsa\u1e41s\u0101ra\u2014material existence; vartmani\u2014on the path of.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThose who are not faithful on the path of devotional service cannot attain Me, O\nconqueror of foes, but return to birth and death in this material world.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe faithless cannot accomplish this process of devotional service; that is the\npurport of this verse. Faith is created by association with devotees.\nUnfortunate people, even after hearing all the evidence of Vedic literature from\ngreat personalities, still have no faith in God. They are hesitant and cannot\nstay fixed in the devotional service of the Lord. Thus faith is a most important\nfactor for progress in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. In the Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta it is\nsaid that one should have complete conviction that simply by serving the Supreme\nLord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a he can achieve all perfection. That is called real faith. In the\n\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (3.4.12) it is stated that by giving water to the root of a\ntree, its branches, twigs and leaves become satisfied, and by supplying food to\nthe stomach all the senses of the body become satisfied, and, similarly, by\nengaging in the transcendental service of the Supreme Lord, all the demigods and\nall the living entities automatically become satisfied.\n\n\nAfter reading Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 one should promptly come to the conclusion of\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101: one should give up all other engagements and adopt the service of\nthe Supreme Lord, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Personality of Godhead. If one is convinced of this\nphilosophy of life, that is faith. Now the development of that faith is the\nprocess of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\n\n\nThere are three divisions of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious men. In the third class are those\nwho have no faith. If they are engaged in devotional service officially, for\nsome ulterior purpose, they cannot achieve the highest perfectional stage. Most\nprobably they will slip, after some time. They may become engaged, but because\nthey haven\u2019t complete conviction and faith, it is very difficult for them to\ncontinue in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. We have practical experience in discharging our\nmissionary activity that some people come and apply themselves to the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness with some hidden motive, and as soon as they are economically a\nlittle well-situated, they give up this process and take to their old ways\nagain. It is only by faith that one can advance in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. As far\nas the development of faith is concerned, one who is well versed in the\nliteratures of devotional service and has attained the stage of firm faith is\ncalled a first-class person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. And in the second class are\nthose who are not very advanced in understanding the devotional scriptures but\nwho automatically have firm faith that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a bhakti or service to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the\nbest course and so in good faith have taken it up. Thus they are superior to the\nthird class who have neither perfect knowledge of the scriptures nor good faith\nbut by association and simplicity are trying to follow. The third-class person\nin K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness may fall down, but when one is in the second class or\nfirst class, he does not fall down. One in the first class will surely make\nprogress and achieve the result at the end. As far as the third-class person in\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is concerned, although he has faith in the conviction that\ndevotional service to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is very good, he has no knowledge of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a through\nthe scriptures like \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam and Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Sometimes these\nthird-class persons in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness have some tendency toward karma-yoga\nand j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga, and sometimes they are disturbed, but as soon as the infection\nof karma-yoga or j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga is vanquished, they become second-class or\nfirst-class persons in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Faith in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is also divided into\nthree stages and described in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. First-class attachment,\nsecond-class attachment, and third-class attachment are also explained in\n\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam in the Eleventh Canto. Those who have no faith even after\nhearing about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and the excellence of devotional service, who think that it\nis simply eulogy, find the path very difficult, even if they are supposedly\nengaged in devotional service. For them there is very little hope in gaining\nperfection. Thus faith is very important in the discharge of devotional service.\n\n\n9.4\n\n\nmay\u0101 tatam ida\u1e41 sarva\u1e41\n\n\njagad avyakta-m\u016brtin\u0101\n\n\nmat-sth\u0101ni sarva-bh\u016bt\u0101ni\n\n\nna c\u0101ha\u1e41 te\u1e63v avasthita\u1e25\n\n\nmay\u0101\u2014by Me; tatam\u2014spread; idam\u2014all these manifestations; sarvam\u2014all;\njagat\u2014cosmic manifestation; avyakta-m\u016brtin\u0101\u2014unmanifested form; mat-sth\u0101ni\u2014unto\nMe; sarva-bh\u016bt\u0101ni\u2014all living entities; na\u2014not; ca\u2014also; aham\u2014I; te\u1e63u\u2014in them;\navasthita\u1e25\u2014situated.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nBy Me, in My unmanifested form, this entire universe is pervaded. All beings are\nin Me, but I am not in them.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe Supreme Personality of Godhead is not perceivable through the gross material\nsenses. It is said that Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s name, fame, pastimes, etc., cannot be\nunderstood by material senses. Only to one who is engaged in pure devotional\nservice under proper guidance is He revealed. In the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 it is\nstated, prem\u0101\u00f1janacchurita.\u2026 One can see the Supreme Personality of Godhead,\nGovinda, always within himself and outside himself if he has developed the\ntranscendental loving attitude towards Him. Thus for people in general He is not\nvisible. Here it is said that although He is all-pervading, everywhere present,\nHe is yet not conceivable by the material senses. But actually, although we\ncannot see Him, everything is resting in Him. As we have discussed in the\nSeventh Chapter, the entire material cosmic manifestation is only a combination\nof His two different energies, the superior spiritual energy and the inferior\nmaterial energy. Just as the sunshine is spread all over the universe, the\nenergy of the Lord is spread all over the creation, and everything is resting in\nthat energy.\n\n\nYet one should not conclude that because He is spread all over He has lost His\npersonal existence. To refute such argument the Lord says, \u201cI am everywhere, and\neverything is in Me, but still I am aloof.\u201d For example, a king heads a\ngovernment which is but the manifestation of the king\u2019s energy; the different\ngovernmental departments are nothing but the energies of the king, and each\ndepartment is resting on the king\u2019s power. But still one cannot expect the king\nto be present in every department personally. That is a crude example.\nSimilarly, all the manifestations that we see, and everything that exists both\nin this material world and in the spiritual world, are resting on the energy of\nthe Supreme Personality of Godhead. The creation takes place by the diffusion of\nHis different energies, and, as is stated in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, He is everywhere\npresent by His personal representation, the diffusion of His different energies.\n\n\n9.5\n\n\nna ca mat-sth\u0101ni bh\u016bt\u0101ni\n\n\npa\u015bya me yogam ai\u015bvaram\n\n\nbh\u016bta-bh\u1e5bn na ca bh\u016bta-stho\n\n\nmam\u0101tm\u0101 bh\u016bta-bh\u0101vana\u1e25\n\n\nna\u2014never; ca\u2014also; mat-sth\u0101ni\u2014situated in Me; bh\u016bt\u0101ni\u2014all creation; pa\u015bya\u2014just\nsee; me\u2014My; yogam ai\u015bvaram\u2014inconceivable mystic power; bh\u016bta-bh\u1e5bt\u2014maintainer of\nall living entities; na\u2014never; ca\u2014also; bh\u016bta-stha\u1e25\u2014in the cosmic manifestation;\nmama\u2014My; \u0101tm\u0101\u2014Self; bh\u016bta-bh\u0101vana\u1e25\u2014is the source of all manifestations.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nAnd yet everything that is created does not rest in Me. Behold My mystic\nopulence! Although I am the maintainer of all living entities, and although I am\neverywhere, still My Self is the very source of creation.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe Lord says that everything is resting on Him. This should not be\nmisunderstood. The Lord is not directly concerned with the maintenance and\nsustenance of this material manifestation. Sometimes we see a picture of Atlas\nholding the globe on his shoulders; he seems to be very tired, holding this\ngreat earthly planet. Such an image should not be entertained in connection with\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s upholding this created universe. He says that although everything is\nresting on Him, still He is aloof. The planetary systems are floating in space,\nand this space is the energy of the Supreme Lord. But He is different from\nspace. He is differently situated. Therefore the Lord says, \u201cAlthough they are\nsituated on My inconceivable energy, still, as the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead, I am aloof from them.\u201d This is the inconceivable opulence of the Lord.\n\n\nIn the Vedic dictionary it is said, \u201cThe Supreme Lord is performing\ninconceivably wonderful pastimes, displaying His energy. His person is full of\ndifferent potent energies, and His determination is itself actual fact. In this\nway the Personality of Godhead is to be understood.\u201d We may think to do\nsomething, but there are so many impediments, and sometimes it is not possible\nto do as we like. But when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a wants to do something, simply by His willing,\neverything is performed so perfectly that one cannot imagine how it is being\ndone. The Lord explains this fact: although He is the maintainer and sustainer\nof all material manifestation, He does not touch this material manifestation.\nSimply by His supreme will everything is created, everything is sustained,\neverything is maintained, and everything is annihilated. There is no difference\nbetween His mind and Himself (as there is a difference between ourselves and our\npresent material mind) because He is absolute spirit. Simultaneously the Lord is\npresent in everything; yet the common man cannot understand how He is also\npresent personally. He is different from this material manifestation, yet\neverything is resting on Him. This is explained here as yogam ai\u015bvaram, the\nmystic power of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\n\n\n9.6\n\n\nyath\u0101k\u0101\u015ba-sthito nitya\u1e41\n\n\nv\u0101yu\u1e25 sarvatra-go mah\u0101n\n\n\ntath\u0101 sarv\u0101\u1e47i bh\u016bt\u0101ni\n\n\nmat-sth\u0101n\u012bty upadh\u0101raya\n\n\nyath\u0101\u2014as much as; \u0101k\u0101\u015ba-sthita\u1e25\u2014situated in space; nityam\u2014always; v\u0101yu\u1e25\u2014wind;\nsarvatra-ga\u1e25\u2014blowing everywhere; mah\u0101n\u2014great; tath\u0101\u2014similarly;\nsarv\u0101\u1e47i\u2014everything, bh\u016bt\u0101ni\u2014created beings; mat-sth\u0101ni\u2014situated in Me; iti\u2014thus;\nupadh\u0101raya\u2014try to understand.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nAs the mighty wind, blowing everywhere, always rests in ethereal space know that\nin the same manner all beings rest in Me.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nFor the ordinary person it is almost inconceivable how the huge material\ncreation is resting in Him. But the Lord is giving an example which may help us\nto understand. Space is the biggest manifestation we can conceive. The cosmic\nmanifestation rests in space. Space permits the movement of even the atoms and\non up to the greatest planets, the sun and the moon. Although the sky (or wind\nor air) is great, still it is situated within space. Space is not beyond the\nsky.\n\n\nSimilarly, all the wonderful cosmic manifestations are existing by the supreme\nwill of God, and all of them are subordinate to that supreme will. As we\ngenerally say, not a blade of grass moves without the will of the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead. Thus everything is moving under His will: by His will\neverything is being created, everything is being maintained, and everything is\nbeing annihilated. Still He is aloof from everything, as space is always aloof\nfrom the activities of the atmosphere. In the Upani\u1e63ads, it is stated, \u201cIt is\nout of the fear of the Supreme Lord that the wind is blowing.\u201d In the Garga\nUpani\u1e63ad also it is stated, \u201cBy the supreme order, under the superintendence of\nthe Supreme Personality of Godhead, the moon, the sun and the great planets are\nmoving.\u201d In the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 this is also stated. There is also a description\nof the movement of the sun, and it is said that the sun is considered to be one\nof the eyes of the Supreme Lord and that it has immense potency to diffuse heat\nand light. Still it is moving in its prescribed orbit by the order and the\nsupreme will of Govinda. So, from the Vedic literature we can find evidence that\nthis material manifestation, which appears to us to be very wonderful and great,\nis under the complete control of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This will\nbe further explained in the later verses of this chapter.\n\n\n9.7\n\n\nsarva-bh\u016bt\u0101ni kaunteya\n\n\nprak\u1e5bti\u1e41 y\u0101nti m\u0101mik\u0101m\n\n\nkalpa-k\u1e63aye punas t\u0101ni\n\n\nkalp\u0101dau vis\u1e5bj\u0101my aham\n\n\nsarva-bh\u016bt\u0101ni\u2014all created entities; kaunteya\u2014O son of Kunt\u012b; prak\u1e5btim\u2014nature;\ny\u0101nti\u2014enter; m\u0101mik\u0101m\u2014unto Me; kalpa-k\u1e63aye\u2014at the end of the millennium;\npuna\u1e25\u2014again; t\u0101ni\u2014all those; kalpa-\u0101dau\u2014in the beginning of the millennium;\nvis\u1e5bj\u0101mi\u2014I create; aham\u2014I.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nO son of Kunt\u012b, at the end of the millennium every material manifestation enters\ninto My nature, and at the beginning of another millennium, by My potency I\nagain create.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe creation, maintenance and annihilation of this material cosmic manifestation\nis completely dependant on the supreme will of the Personality of Godhead. \u201cAt\nthe end of the millennium\u201d means at the death of Brahm\u0101. Brahm\u0101 lives for one\nhundred years, and his one day is calculated at 4,300,000,000 of our earthly\nyears. His night is of the same duration. His month consists of thirty such days\nand nights, and his year of twelve months. After one hundred such years, when\nBrahm\u0101 dies, the devastation or annihilation takes place; this means that the\nenergy manifested by the Supreme Lord is again wound up in Himself. Then again,\nwhen there is need to manifest the cosmic world, it is done by His will:\n\u201cAlthough I am one, I shall become many.\u201d This is the Vedic aphorism. He expands\nHimself in this material energy, and the whole cosmic manifestation again takes\nplace.\n\n\n9.8\n\n\nprak\u1e5bti\u1e41 sv\u0101m ava\u1e63\u1e6dabhya\n\n\nvis\u1e5bj\u0101mi puna\u1e25 puna\u1e25\n\n\nbh\u016bta-gr\u0101mam ima\u1e41 k\u1e5btsnam\n\n\nava\u015ba\u1e41 prak\u1e5bter va\u015b\u0101t\n\n\nprak\u1e5btim\u2014material nature; sv\u0101m\u2014of My personal self; ava\u1e63\u1e6dabhya\u2014enter in;\nvis\u1e5bj\u0101mi\u2014create; puna\u1e25 puna\u1e25\u2014again, again; bh\u016bta-gr\u0101mam\u2014all these cosmic\nmanifestations; imam\u2014this; k\u1e5btsnam\u2014total; ava\u015bam\u2014automatically; prak\u1e5bte\u1e25\u2014by the\nforce of nature; va\u015b\u0101t\u2014under obligation.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThe whole cosmic order is under Me. By My will it is manifested again and again,\nand by My will it is annihilated at the end.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThis matter is the manifestation of the inferior energy of the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead. This has already been explained several times. At the\ncreation, the material energy is let loose as mahat-tattva, into which the Lord\nas His first Puru\u1e63a incarnation, Mah\u0101-Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, enters. He lies within the Causal\nOcean and breathes out innumerable universes, and into each universe the Lord\nagain enters as Garbhodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Each universe is in that way created. He\nstill further manifests Himself as K\u1e63\u012brodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, and that Vi\u1e63\u1e47u enters\ninto everything\u2014even into the minute atom. This fact is explained here. He\nenters into everything.\n\n\nNow, as far as the living entities are concerned, they are impregnated into this\nmaterial nature, and as a result of their past deeds they take different\npositions. Thus the activities of this material world begin. The activities of\nthe different species of living beings are begun from the very moment of the\ncreation. It is not that all is evolved. The different species of life are\ncreated immediately along with the universe. Men, animals, beasts,\nbirds\u2014everything is simultaneously created, because whatever desires the living\nentities had at the last annihilation are again manifested. It is clearly stated\nhere that the living entities have nothing to do with this process. The state of\nbeing in their past life in the past creation is simply manifested again, and\nall this is done simply by His will. This is the inconceivable potency of the\nSupreme Personality of God. And after creating different species of life, He has\nno connection with them. The creation takes place to accommodate the\ninclinations of the various living entities, and so the Lord does not become\ninvolved with it.\n\n\n9.9\n\n\nna ca m\u0101\u1e41 t\u0101ni karm\u0101\u1e47i\n\n\nnibadhnanti dhana\u00f1jaya\n\n\nud\u0101s\u012bna-vad \u0101s\u012bnam\n\n\nasakta\u1e41 te\u1e63u karmasu\n\n\nna\u2014never; ca\u2014also; m\u0101m\u2014Me; t\u0101ni\u2014all those; karm\u0101\u1e47i\u2014activities; nibadhnanti\u2014bind;\ndhana\u00f1jaya\u2014O conquerer of riches; ud\u0101s\u012bnavat\u2014as neutral; \u0101s\u012bnam\u2014situated;\nasaktam\u2014without attraction; te\u1e63u\u2014in them; karmasu\u2014in activities.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nO Dhana\u00f1jaya, all this work cannot bind Me. I am ever detached, seated as though\nneutral.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nOne should not think, in this connection, that the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead has no engagement. In His spiritual world He is always engaged. In the\nBrahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 it is stated: \u201cHe is always involved in His eternal, blissful,\nspiritual activities, but He has nothing to do with these material activities.\u201d\nMaterial activities are being carried on by His different potencies. The Lord is\nalways neutral in the material activities of the created world. This neutrality\nis explained here. Although He has control over every minute detail of matter,\nHe is sitting as if neutral. The example can be given of a high court judge\nsitting on his bench. By his order so many things are happening: someone is\nbeing hanged, someone is being put into jail, someone is awarded a huge amount\nof wealth\u2014but still he is neutral. He has nothing to do with all that gain and\nloss. Similarly, the Lord is always neutral, although He has His hand in every\nsphere of activity. In the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra it is stated that He is not situated in\nthe dualities of this material world. He is transcendental to these dualities.\nNor is He attached to the creation and annihilation of this material world. The\nliving entities take their different forms in the various species of life\naccording to their past deeds, and the Lord doesn\u2019t interfere with them.\n\n\n9.10\n\n\nmay\u0101dhyak\u1e63e\u1e47a prak\u1e5bti\u1e25\n\n\ns\u016byate sa-car\u0101caram\n\n\nhetun\u0101nena kaunteya\n\n\njagad viparivartate\n\n\nmay\u0101\u2014by Me; adhyak\u1e63e\u1e47a\u2014by superintendence; prak\u1e5bti\u1e25\u2014material nature;\ns\u016byate\u2014manifest; sa\u2014with; car\u0101caram\u2014moving and nonmoving; hetun\u0101\u2014for this\nreason; anena\u2014this; kaunteya\u2014O son of Kunt\u012b; jagat\u2014the cosmic manifestation;\nviparivartate\u2014is working.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThis material nature is working under My direction, O son of Kunt\u012b, and it is\nproducing all moving and unmoving beings. By its rule this manifestation is\ncreated and annihilated again and again.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nIt is clearly stated here that the Supreme Lord, although aloof from all the\nactivities of the material world, remains the supreme director. The Supreme Lord\nis the supreme will and the background of this material manifestation, but the\nmanagement is being conducted by material nature. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a also states in\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that of all the living entities in different forms and species, \u201cI\nam the Father.\u201d The father gives seeds to the womb of the mother for the child,\nand similarly the Supreme Lord by His mere glance injects all the living\nentities into the womb of material nature, and they come out in their different\nforms and species, according to their last desires and activities. All these\nliving entities, although born under the glance of the Supreme Lord, still take\ntheir different bodies according to their past deeds and desires. So the Lord is\nnot directly attached to this material creation. He simply glances over material\nnature; material nature is thus activated, and everything is created\nimmediately. Because He glances over material nature, there is undoubtedly\nactivity on the part of the Supreme Lord, but He has nothing to do with the\nmanifestation of the material world directly. This example is given in the\nsm\u1e5bti: when there is a fragrant flower before someone, the fragrance is touched\nby the smelling power of the person, yet the smelling and the flower are\ndetached from one another. There is a similar connection between the material\nworld and the Supreme Personality of Godhead; actually He has nothing to do with\nthis material world, but He creates by His glance and ordains. In summary,\nmaterial nature, without the superintendence of the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead, cannot do anything. Yet the Supreme Personality is detached from all\nmaterial activities.\n\n\n9.11\n\n\navaj\u0101nanti m\u0101\u1e41 m\u016b\u1e0dh\u0101\n\n\nm\u0101nu\u1e63\u012b\u1e41 tanum \u0101\u015britam\n\n\npara\u1e41 bh\u0101vam aj\u0101nanto\n\n\nmama bh\u016bta-mahe\u015bvaram\n\n\navaj\u0101nanti\u2014deride; m\u0101m\u2014Me; m\u016b\u1e0dh\u0101\u1e25\u2014foolish men; m\u0101nu\u1e63\u012bm\u2014in a human form;\ntanum\u2014body; \u0101\u015britam\u2014assuming; param\u2014transcendental; bh\u0101vam\u2014nature; aj\u0101nanta\u1e25\u2014not\nknowing; mama\u2014Mine; bh\u016bta\u2014everything that be; mahe\u015bvaram\u2014supreme proprietor.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nFools deride Me when I descend in the human form. They do not know My\ntranscendental nature and My supreme dominion over all that be.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nFrom the other explanations of the previous verses in this chapter, it is clear\nthat the Supreme Personality of Godhead, although appearing like a human being,\nis not a common man. The Personality of Godhead, who conducts the creation,\nmaintenance and annihilation of the complete cosmic manifestation, cannot be a\nhuman being. Yet there are many foolish men who consider K\u1e5b,s\u1e47a to be merely a\npowerful man and nothing more. Actually, He is the original Supreme Personality,\nas is confirmed in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (i\u015bvara\u1e25 parama\u1e25 k\u1e5bs\u1e47a\u1e25); He is the\nSupreme Lord.\n\n\nThere are many \u012b\u015bvaras, controllers, and one appears greater than another. In\nthe ordinary management of affairs in the material world, we find some official\nor director, and above him there is a secretary, and above him a minister, and\nabove him a president. Each of them is a controller, but one is controlled by\nanother. In the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 it is said that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the supreme controller;\nthere are many controllers undoubtedly both in the material and spiritual world,\nbut K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the supreme controller (\u012b\u015bvara\u1e25 parama\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u1e25), and His body is\nsac-cid-\u0101nanda, non-material.\n\n\nMaterial bodies cannot perform the wonderful acts described in previous verses.\nHis body is eternal, blissful and full of knowledge. Although He is not a common\nman, the foolish deride Him and consider Him to be a man. His body is called\nhere m\u0101nu\u1e63\u012bm because He is acting just like a man, a friend of Arjuna\u2019s, a\npolitician involved in the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra. In so many ways He is acting\njust like an ordinary man, but actually His body is\nsac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha\u2014eternal bliss and knowledge absolute. This is confirmed\nin the Vedic language also (sac-cid-\u0101nanda-r\u016bp\u0101ya k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47\u0101ya): \u201cI offer my\nobeisances unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who is the eternal\nblissful form of knowledge.\u201d There are other descriptions in the Vedic language\nalso. Tam eka\u1e41 govindam: \u201cYou are Govinda, the pleasure of the senses and the\ncows.\u201d Sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraham: \u201cAnd Your form is transcendental, full of\nknowledge, bliss and eternality.\u201d\n\n\nDespite the transcendental qualities of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s body, its full bliss and\nknowledge, there are many so-called scholars and commentators of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101\nwho deride K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as an ordinary man. The scholar may be born an extraordinary\nman due to his previous good work, but this conception of \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is due to a\npoor fund of knowledge. Therefore he is called m\u016b\u1e0dha, for only foolish persons\nconsider K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to be an ordinary human being because they do not know the\nconfidential activities of the Supreme Lord and His different energies. They do\nnot know that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s body is a symbol of complete knowledge and bliss, that He\nis the proprietor of everything that be and that He can award liberation to\nanyone. Because they do not know that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has so many transcendental\nqualifications, they deride Him.\n\n\nNor do they know that the appearance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in\nthis material world is a manifestation of His internal energy. He is the master\nof the material energy. As has been explained in several places (mama m\u0101y\u0101\nduratyay\u0101), He claims that the material energy, although very powerful, is under\nHis control, and whoever surrenders unto Him can get out of the control of this\nmaterial energy. If a soul surrendered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can get out of the influence of\nmaterial energy, then how can the Supreme Lord, who conducts the creation,\nmaintenance and annihilation of the whole cosmic nature, have a material body\nlike us? So this conception of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is complete foolishness. Foolish persons,\nhowever, cannot conceive that the Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, appearing just\nlike an ordinary man, can be the controller of all the atoms and of the gigantic\nmanifestation of the universal form. The biggest and the minutest are beyond\ntheir conception, so they cannot imagine that a form like that of a human being\ncan simultaneously control the infinite and the minute. Actually although He is\ncontrolling the infinite and the finite, He is apart from all this\nmanifestation. It is clearly stated concerning His yogam ai\u015bvaram, His\ninconceivable transcendental energy, that He can control the infinite and the\nfinite simultaneously and that He can remain aloof from them. Although the\nfoolish cannot imagine how K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who appears just like a human being, can\ncontrol the infinite and the finite, those who are pure devotees accept this,\nfor they know that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore they\ncompletely surrender unto Him and engage in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, devotional\nservice of the Lord.\n\n\nThere are many controversies amongst the impersonalists and the personalists\nabout the Lord\u2019s appearance as a human being. But if we consult Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101\nand \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, the authoritative texts for understanding the science of\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, then we can understand that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\nHe is not an ordinary man, although He appeared on this earth as an ordinary\nhuman. In the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, First Canto, First Chapter, when the sages\ninquire about the activities of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, it is stated that His appearance as a man\nbewilders the foolish. No human being could perform the wonderful acts that\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a performed while He was present on this earth. When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a appeared before\nHis father and mother, Vasudeva and Devak\u012b, He appeared with four hands, but\nafter the prayers of the parents, He transformed Himself into an ordinary child.\nHis appearance as an ordinary human being is one of the features of His\ntranscendental body. In the Eleventh Chapter of the G\u012bt\u0101 also it is stated,\ntenaiva r\u016bpe\u1e47a etc. Arjuna prayed to see again that form of four hands, and when\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was thus petitioned by Arjuna, He again assumed His original form. All\nthese different features of the Supreme Lord are certainly not those of an\nordinary human being.\n\n\nSome of those who deride K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who are infected with the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophy,\nquote the following verse from the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam to prove that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is just\nan ordinary man: aha\u1e41 sarve\u1e63u bh\u016bte\u1e63u bh\u016bt\u0101tm\u0101vasthita\u1e25 sad\u0101: \u201cThe Supreme is\npresent in every living entity.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 3.29.21) We should better take note of\nthis particular verse from the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava \u0101c\u0101ryas like J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b instead of\nfollowing the interpretation of unauthorized persons who deride K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. J\u012bva\nGosv\u0101m\u012b, commenting on this verse, says that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, in His plenary expansion as\nParam\u0101tm\u0101, is situated in the moving and the nonmoving entities as the\nSupersoul, so any neophyte devotee who simply gives his attention to the\narca-m\u016brti, the form of the Supreme Lord in the temple, and does not respect\nother living entities is uselessly worshiping the form of the Lord in the\ntemple. There are three kinds of devotees of the Lord, and the neophyte is in\nthe lowest stage. The neophyte devotee gives more attention to the Deity in the\ntemple than to other devotees, so J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b warns that this sort of mentality\nshould be corrected. A devotee should see that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is present in everyone\u2019s\nheart as Param\u0101tm\u0101; therefore every body is the embodiment or the temple of the\nSupreme Lord, and as such, as one offers respect to the temple of the Lord, he\nshould similarly properly respect each and every body in whom the Param\u0101tm\u0101\ndwells. Everyone should therefore be given proper respect and should not be\nneglected.\n\n\nThere are also many impersonalists who deride temple worship. They say that\nsince God is everywhere, why should one restrict himself to temple worship? But\nif God is everywhere, is He not in the temple or in the Deity? Although the\npersonalist and the impersonalist will fight with one another perpetually, a\nperfect devotee in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness knows that although K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme\nPersonality, He is all-pervading, as is confirmed in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101.\nAlthough His personal abode is Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana and He is always staying there,\nstill, by His different manifestations of energy and by His plenary expansion,\nHe is present everywhere in all parts of the material and spiritual creation.\n\n\n9.12\n\n\nmogh\u0101\u015b\u0101 mogha-karm\u0101\u1e47o\n\n\nmogha-j\u00f1\u0101n\u0101 vicetasa\u1e25\n\n\nr\u0101k\u1e63as\u012bm \u0101sur\u012b\u1e41 caiva\n\n\nprak\u1e5bti\u1e41 mohin\u012b\u1e41 \u015brit\u0101\u1e25\n\n\nmogh\u0101\u015b\u0101\u1e25\u2014baffled hope; mogha-karm\u0101\u1e47a\u1e25\u2014baffled in fruitive activities;\nmogha-j\u00f1\u0101n\u0101\u1e25\u2014baffled in knowledge; vicetasa\u1e25\u2014bewildered; r\u0101k\u1e63as\u012bm\u2014demonic;\n\u0101sur\u012bm\u2014atheistic; ca\u2014and; eva\u2014certainly; prak\u1e5btim\u2014nature; mohin\u012bm\u2014bewildering;\n\u015brit\u0101\u1e25\u2014taking shelter of.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThose who are thus bewildered are attracted by demonic and atheistic views. In\nthat deluded condition, their hopes for liberation, their fruitive activities,\nand their culture of knowledge are all defeated.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThere are many devotees who assume themselves to be in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and\ndevotional service but at heart do not accept the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, as the Absolute Truth. For them, the fruit of devotional\nservice\u2014going back to Godhead\u2014will never be tasted. Similarly, those who are\nengaged in fruitive, pious activities and who are ultimately hoping to be\nliberated from this material entanglement will never be successful either\nbecause they deride the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In other words,\npersons who mock K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are to be understood to be demonic or atheistic. As\ndescribed in the Seventh Chapter of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, such demonic miscreants never\nsurrender to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore their mental speculations to arrive at the\nAbsolute Truth bring them to the false conclusion that the ordinary living\nentity and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are one and the same. With such a false conviction, they think\nthat the body of any human being is now simply covered by material nature and\nthat as soon as one is liberated from this material body there is no difference\nbetween God and himself. This attempt to become one with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a will be baffled\nbecause of delusion. Such atheistic and demoniac cultivation of spiritual\nknowledge is always futile. That is the indication of this verse. For such\npersons, cultivation of the knowledge in the Vedic literature, like the\nVed\u0101nta-s\u016btra and the Upani\u1e63ads, is always baffled.\n\n\nIt is a great offense, therefore, to consider K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead, to be an ordinary man. Those who do so are certainly deluded because\nthey cannot understand the eternal form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In the B\u1e5bhad-vai\u1e63\u1e47ava mantra\nit is clearly stated that one who considers the body of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to be material\nshould be driven out from all rituals and activities of the \u015bruti. And if one by\nchance sees his face, he should at once take bath in the Ganges to rid himself\nof infection. People jeer at K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a because they are envious of the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead. Their destiny is certainly to take birth after birth in\nthe species of atheistic and demoniac life.

The first sign of the\nmah\u0101tm\u0101 is that he is already situated in the divine nature. He is not under the\ncontrol of material nature. And how is this effected? That is explained in the\nSeventh Chapter: one who surrenders unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, \u015ar\u012b\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, at once becomes freed from the control of material nature. That is the\nqualification. One can become free from the control of material nature as soon\nas he surrenders his soul to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That is the\npreliminary formula. Being marginal potency, as soon as the living entity is\nfreed from the control of material nature, he is put under the guidance of the\nspiritual nature. The guidance of the spiritual nature is called daiv\u012b\u1e41\nprak\u1e5btim, divine nature. So, when one is promoted in that way\u2014by surrendering to\nthe Supreme Personality of Godhead\u2014one attains to the stage of great soul,\nmah\u0101tm\u0101.\n\n\nThe mah\u0101tm\u0101 does not divert his attention to anything outside K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a because he\nknows perfectly well that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the original Supreme Person, the cause of all\ncauses. There is no doubt about it. Such a mah\u0101tm\u0101, or great soul, develops\nthrough association with other mah\u0101tm\u0101s, pure devotees. Pure devotees are not\neven attracted by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s other features, such as the four-armed Mah\u0101-Vi\u1e63\u1e47u.\nThey are simply attracted by the two-armed form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Since they are not\nattracted to other features of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (what to speak of the demigods), they are\nnot concerned with any form of a demigod or of a human being. They only meditate\nupon K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. They are always engaged in the unswerving\nservice of the Lord in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\n\n\n9.14\n\n\nsatata\u1e41 k\u012brtayanto m\u0101\u1e41\n\n\nyatanta\u015b ca d\u1e5b\u1e0dha-vrat\u0101\u1e25\n\n\nnamasyanta\u015b ca m\u0101\u1e41 bhakty\u0101\n\n\nnitya-yukt\u0101 up\u0101sate\n\n\nsatatam\u2014always; k\u012brtayanta\u1e25\u2014chanting; m\u0101m\u2014Me; yatanta\u1e25 ca\u2014fully endeavoring\nalso; d\u1e5b\u1e0dha-vrat\u0101\u1e25\u2014with determination; namasyanta\u1e25 ca\u2014offering obeisances;\nm\u0101m\u2014unto Me; bhakty\u0101\u2014in devotion; nitya-yukt\u0101\u1e25\u2014perpetually engaged;\nup\u0101sate\u2014worship.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nAlways chanting My glories, endeavoring with great determination, bowing down\nbefore Me, these great souls perpetually worship Me with devotion.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe mah\u0101tm\u0101 cannot be manufactured by rubber-stamping an ordinary man. His\nsymptoms are described here: a mah\u0101tm\u0101 is always engaged in chanting the glories\nof the Supreme Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Personality of Godhead. He has no other business.\nHe is always engaged in the glorification of the Lord. In other words, he is not\nan impersonalist. When the question of glorification is there, one has to\nglorify the Supreme Lord, praising His holy name, His eternal form, His\ntranscendental qualities and His uncommon pastimes. One has to glorify all these\nthings; therefore a mah\u0101tm\u0101 is attached to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\n\n\nOne who is attached to the impersonal feature of the Supreme Lord, the\nbrahmajyoti, is not described as mah\u0101tm\u0101 in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. He is described\nin a different way in the next verse. The mah\u0101tm\u0101 is always engaged in different\nactivities of devotional service, as described in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, hearing\nand chanting about Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, not a demigod or human being. That is devotion:\n\u015brava\u1e47a\u1e41 k\u012brtana\u1e41 vi\u1e63\u1e47o\u1e25, smara\u1e47am, and remembering Him. Such a mah\u0101tm\u0101 has firm\ndetermination to achieve at the ultimate end the association of the Supreme Lord\nin any one of the five transcendental rasas. To achieve that success, he engages\nall activities\u2014mental, bodily and vocal, everything\u2014in the service of the\nSupreme Lord, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. That is called full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\n\n\nIn devotional service there are certain activities which are called determined,\nsuch as fasting on certain days, like the eleventh day of the moon, Ek\u0101da\u015b\u012b, and\non the appearance day of the Lord, etc. All these rules and regulations are\noffered by the great \u0101c\u0101ryas for those who are actually interested in getting\nadmission into the association of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in the\ntranscendental world. The mah\u0101tm\u0101s, great souls, strictly observe all these\nrules and regulations, and therefore they are sure to achieve the desired\nresult.\n\n\nAs described in the second verse of this chapter, this devotional service is not\nonly easy, but it can be performed in a happy mood. One does not need to undergo\nany severe penance and austerity. He can live this life in devotional service,\nguided by an expert spiritual master, and in any position, either as a\nhouseholder or a sanny\u0101s\u012b, or a brahmac\u0101r\u012b; in any position and anywhere in the\nworld, he can perform this devotional service to the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead and thus become actually mah\u0101tm\u0101, a great soul.\n\n\n9.15\n\n\nj\u00f1\u0101na-yaj\u00f1ena c\u0101py anye\n\n\nyajanto m\u0101m up\u0101sate\n\n\nekatvena p\u1e5bthaktvena\n\n\nbahudh\u0101 vi\u015bvato-mukham\n\n\nj\u00f1\u0101na-yaj\u00f1ena\u2014by cultivation of knowledge; ca\u2014also; api\u2014certainly; anye\u2014others;\nyajanta\u1e25\u2014worshiping; m\u0101m\u2014Me; up\u0101sate\u2014worship; ekatvena\u2014in oneness;\np\u1e5bthaktvena\u2014in duality; bahudh\u0101\u2014diversity; vi\u015bvata\u1e25-mukham\u2014in the universal\nform.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nOthers, who are engaged in the cultivation of knowledge, worship the Supreme\nLord as the one without a second, diverse in many, and in the universal form.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThis verse is the summary of the previous verses. The Lord tells Arjuna that\nthose who are purely in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and do not know anything other than\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are called mah\u0101tm\u0101; yet there are other persons who are not exactly in the\nposition of mah\u0101tm\u0101 but who worship K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a also, in different ways. Some of them\nare already described as the distressed, the financially destitute, the\ninquisitive, and those who are engaged in the cultivation of knowledge. But\nthere are others who are still lower, and these are divided into three: 1) He\nwho worships himself as one with the Supreme Lord, 2) He who concocts some form\nof the Supreme Lord and worships that, and 3) He who accepts the universal form,\nthe vi\u015bvar\u016bpa of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and worships that. Out of\nthe above three, the lowest, those who worship themselves as the Supreme Lord,\nthinking themselves to be monists, are most predominant. Such people think\nthemselves to be the Supreme Lord, and in this mentality they worship\nthemselves. This is also a type of God worship, for they can understand that\nthey are not the material body but are actually spiritual soul; at least, such a\nsense is prominent. Generally the impersonalists worship the Supreme Lord in\nthis way. The second class includes the worshipers of the demigods, those who by\nimagination consider any form to be the form of the Supreme Lord. And the third\nclass includes those who cannot conceive of anything beyond the manifestation of\nthis material universe. They consider the universe to be the supreme organism or\nentity and worship that. The universe is also a form of the Lord.\n\n\n9.16\n\n\naha\u1e41 kratur aha\u1e41 yaj\u00f1a\u1e25\n\n\nsvadh\u0101ham aham au\u1e63adham\n\n\nmantro \u2019ham aham ev\u0101jyam\n\n\naham agnir aha\u1e41 hutam\n\n\naham\u2014I; kratu\u1e25\u2014ritual; aham\u2014I; yaj\u00f1a\u1e25\u2014sacrifice; svadh\u0101\u2014oblation; aham\u2014I ;\naham\u2014I; au\u1e63adham\u2014healing herb ; mantra\u1e25\u2014transcendental chant; aham\u2014I; aham\u2014I;\neva\u2014certainly; ajyam\u2014melted butter; aham\u2014I; agni\u1e25\u2014fire; aham\u2014I; hutam\u2014offering.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nBut it is I who am the ritual, I the sacrifice, the offering to the ancestors,\nthe healing herb, the transcendental chant. I am the butter and the fire and the\noffering.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe sacrifice known as jyoti\u1e63\u1e6doma is also K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and He is also the mah\u0101-yaj\u00f1a\nThe oblations offered to the Pit\u1e5bloka or the sacrifice performed to please the\nPit\u1e5bloka, considered as a kind of drug in the form of clarified butter, is also\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The mantras chanted in this connection are also K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. And many other\ncommodities made with milk products for offering in the sacrifices are also\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The fire is also K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a because fire is one of the five material elements\nand is therefore claimed as the separated energy of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In other words, the\nVedic sacrifices recommended in the karma-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da division of the Vedas are in\ntotal also K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Or, in other words, those who are engaged in rendering\ndevotional service unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are to be understood to have performed all the\nsacrifices recommended in the Vedas.\n\n\n9.17\n\n\npit\u0101ham asya jagato\n\n\nm\u0101t\u0101 dh\u0101t\u0101 pit\u0101maha\u1e25\n\n\nvedya\u1e41 pavitram o\u1e41k\u0101ra\n\n\n\u1e5bk s\u0101ma yajur eva ca\n\n\npit\u0101\u2014father; aham\u2014I; asya\u2014of this; jagata\u1e25\u2014of the universe; m\u0101t\u0101\u2014mother;\ndh\u0101t\u0101\u2014supporter; pit\u0101maha\u1e25\u2014grandfather; vedyam\u2014what is to be known;\npavitram\u2014that which purifies; omk\u0101ra\u1e25\u2014the syllable om; \u1e5bk\u2014the \u1e5ag-veda; s\u0101ma\u2014the\nS\u0101ma-veda; yaju\u1e25\u2014the Yajur-veda; eva\u2014certainly; ca\u2014and.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nI am the father of this universe, the mother, the support, and the grandsire.

In the material existence we create\ndifferent relationships with different living entities who are nothing but\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s marginal energy, but under the creation of prak\u1e5bti some of them appear\nas our father, mother, grandfather, creator, etc., but actually they are parts\nand parcels of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. As such, these living entities who appear to be our\nfather, mother, etc., are nothing but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In this verse the word dh\u0101t\u0101 means\ncreator. Not only are our father and mother parts and parcels of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but\ntheir creator, grandmother, and grandfather, etc., are also K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Actually any\nliving entity, being part and parcel of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. All the Vedas,\ntherefore, aim only toward K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Whatever we want to know through the Vedas is\nbut a progressive step to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. That subject matter which helps us\npurify our constitutional position is especially K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Similarly, the living\nentity who is inquisitive to understand all Vedic principles is also part and\nparcel of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and as such is also K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In all the Vedic mantras the word om,\ncalled pra\u1e47ava, is a transcendental sound vibration and is also K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. And\nbecause in all the hymns of the four Vedas, S\u0101ma, Yajur, \u1e5ag and Atharva, the\npra\u1e47ava or omk\u0101ra is very prominent, it is understood to be K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\n\n\n9.18\n\n\ngatir bhart\u0101 prabhu\u1e25 s\u0101k\u1e63\u012b\n\n\nniv\u0101sa\u1e25 \u015bara\u1e47a\u1e41 suh\u1e5bt\n\n\nprabhava\u1e25 pralaya\u1e25 sth\u0101na\u1e41\n\n\nnidh\u0101na\u1e41 b\u012bjam avyayam\n\n\ngati\u1e25\u2014goal; bhart\u0101\u2014sustainer; prabhu\u1e25\u2014Lord; s\u0101k\u1e63\u012b\u2014witness; niv\u0101sa\u1e25\u2014abode;\n\u015bara\u1e47am\u2014refuge; suh\u1e5bt\u2014most intimate friend; prabhava\u1e25\u2014creation;\npralaya\u1e25\u2014dissolution; sth\u0101nam\u2014ground; nidh\u0101nam\u2014resting place; b\u012bjam\u2014seed;\navyayam\u2014imperishable.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nI am the goal, the sustainer, the master, the witness, the abode, the refuge and\nthe most dear friend. I am the creation and the annihilation, the basis of\neverything, the resting place and the eternal seed.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nGati means the destination where we want to go. But the ultimate goal is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a,\nalthough people do not know it. One who does not know K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is misled, and his\nso-called progressive march is either partial or hallucinatory. There are many\nwho make as their destination different demigods, and by rigid performance of\nthe strict respective methods they reach different planets known as Candraloka,\nS\u016bryaloka, Indraloka, Maharloka, etc. But all such lokas or planets, being\ncreations of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, are simultaneously K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and not K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Actually such\nplanets, being the manifestations of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s energy, are also K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but\nactually they only serve as a step forward for realization of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. To approach\nthe different energies of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is to approach K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a indirectly. One should\ndirectly approach K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, for that will save time and energy. For example, if\nthere is a possibility of going to the top of a building by the help of an\nelevator, why should one go by the staircase, step by step? Everything is\nresting on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s energy; therefore without K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s shelter nothing can exist.\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the supreme ruler because everything belongs to Him and everything\nexists on His energy. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, being situated in everyone\u2019s heart, is the supreme\nwitness. The residences, countries or planets on which we live are also K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the ultimate goal of shelter, and as such one should take shelter of\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a either for protection or for annihilation of his distressed condition. And\nwhenever we have to take protection, we should know that our protection must be\na living force. Thus K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the supreme living entity. Since K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the\nsource of our generation, or the supreme father, no one can be a better friend\nthan K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, nor can anyone be a better well-wisher. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the original source\nof creation and the ultimate rest after annihilation. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is therefore the\neternal cause of all causes.\n\n\n9.19\n\n\ntap\u0101my aham aha\u1e41 var\u1e63a\u1e41\n\n\nnig\u1e5bh\u1e47\u0101my uts\u1e5bj\u0101mi ca\n\n\nam\u1e5bta\u1e41 caiva m\u1e5btyu\u015b ca\n\n\nsad asac c\u0101ham arjuna\n\n\ntap\u0101mi\u2014give heat; aham\u2014I; aham\u2014I; var\u1e63am\u2014rain; nig\u1e5bh\u1e47\u0101mi\u2014withold; uts\u1e5bj\u0101mi\u2014send\nforth; ca\u2014and; am\u1e5btam\u2014immortality; ca\u2014and; eva\u2014certainly; m\u1e5btyu\u1e25\u2014death; ca\u2014and;\nsat\u2014being; asat\u2014nonbeing; ca\u2014and; aham\u2014I; arjuna\u2014O Arjuna.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nO Arjuna, I control heat, the rain and the drought. I am immortality, and I am\nalso death personified. Both being and nonbeing are in Me.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, by His different energies, diffuses heat and light through the agency of\nelectricity and the sun. During summer season it is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a who checks rain from\nfalling from the sky, and then, during the rainy season, He gives unceasing\ntorrents of rain. The energy which sustains us by prolonging the duration of our\nlife is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a meets us at the end as death. By analyzing all these\ndifferent energies of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one can acertain that for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a there is no\ndistinction between matter and spirit, or, in other words, He is both matter and\nspirit. In the advanced stage of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, one does not therefore\nmake such distinctions. He sees K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a only in everything.\n\n\nSince K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is both matter and spirit, the gigantic universal form comprising\nall material manifestations is also K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and His pastimes in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana as\ntwo-handed \u015ay\u0101masundara, playing on a flute, are those of the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead.\n\n\n9.20\n\n\ntrai-vidy\u0101 m\u0101\u1e41 soma-p\u0101\u1e25 p\u016bta-p\u0101p\u0101\n\n\nyaj\u00f1air i\u1e63\u1e6dv\u0101 svar-gati\u1e41 pr\u0101rthayante\n\n\nte pu\u1e47yam \u0101s\u0101dya surendra-lokam\n\n\na\u015bnanti divy\u0101n divi deva-bhog\u0101n\n\n\ntrai-vidy\u0101\u1e25\u2014the knowers of the three Vedas; m\u0101m\u2014unto Me; soma-p\u0101\u1e25\u2014drinkers of\nsoma juice; p\u016bta\u2014purified; p\u0101p\u0101\u1e25\u2014sins; yaj\u00f1ai\u1e25\u2014with sacrifices; i\u1e63\u1e6dv\u0101\u2014after\nworshiping; svargatim\u2014passage to heaven; pr\u0101rthayante\u2014pray; te\u2014they;\npu\u1e47yam\u2014virtue; \u0101s\u0101dya\u2014enjoying; surendra\u2014of Indra; lokam\u2014world; a\u015bnanti\u2014enjoy;\ndivy\u0101n\u2014celestial; divi\u2014in heaven; deva-bhog\u0101n\u2014pleasures of the gods.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThose who study the Vedas and drink the soma juice, seeking the heavenly\nplanets, worship Me indirectly.

A br\u0101hma\u1e47a\nwho has studied these three Vedas is called a tri-ved\u012b. Anyone who is very much\nattached to knowledge derived from these three Vedas is respected in society.\nUnfortunately, there are many great scholars of the Vedas who do not know the\nultimate purport of studying them. Therefore K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a herein declares Himself to be\nthe ultimate goal for the tri-ved\u012bs. Actual tri-ved\u012bs take shelter under the\nlotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and engage in pure devotional service to satisfy the Lord.\nDevotional service begins with the chanting of the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra and side by\nside trying to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in truth. Unfortunately those who are simply\nofficial students of the Vedas become more interested in offering sacrifices to\nthe different demigods like Indra, Candra, etc. By such endeavor, the worshipers\nof different demigods are certainly purified of the contamination of the lower\nqualities of nature and are thereby elevated to the higher planetary system or\nheavenly planets known as Maharloka, Janaloka, Tapoloka, etc. Once situated on\nthose higher planetary systems, one can satisfy his senses hundreds of thousands\nof times better than on this planet.\n\n\nDevotional service begins with the chanting of the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra and side by\nside trying to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in truth.

One is again sent back to this earthly planet upon finishing\nthe resultant fruits of pious activities. He who has not attained perfection of\nknowledge, as indicated in the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra (janm\u0101dy asya yata\u1e25), or, in other\nwords, he who fails to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the cause of all causes, becomes\nbaffled in achieving the ultimate goal of life and is thus subjected to the\nroutine of being promoted to the higher planets and then again coming down, as\nif situated on a ferris wheel which sometimes goes up and sometimes comes down.\nThe purport is that instead of being elevated to the spiritual world where there\nis no longer any possibility of coming down, one simply revolves in the cycle of\nbirth and death on higher and lower planetary systems.

Such activities are all auspicious and full of\nspiritual potencies; indeed, they make the devotee perfect in self-realization.\nThen his only desire is to achieve the association of the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead. This is called yoga. By the mercy of the Lord, such a devotee never\ncomes back to this material condition of life. K\u1e63ema refers to the merciful\nprotection of the Lord. The Lord helps the devotee to achieve K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness by yoga, and when he becomes fully K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious the Lord\nprotects him from falling down to a miserable conditioned life.\n\n\n9.23\n\n\nye \u2019py anya-devat\u0101-bhakt\u0101\n\n\nyajante \u015braddhay\u0101nvit\u0101\u1e25\n\n\nte \u2019pi m\u0101m eva kaunteya\n\n\nyajanty avidhi-p\u016brvakam\n\n\nye\u2014those; api\u2014also; anya\u2014other; devat\u0101\u2014demigods; bhakt\u0101\u1e25\u2014devotees;\nyajante\u2014worship; \u015braddhaya-anvit\u0101\u1e25\u2014with faith; te\u2014they; api\u2014also; m\u0101m\u2014Me;\neva\u2014even; kaunteya\u2014O son of Kunt\u012b; yajanti\u2014sacrifice; avidhi-p\u016brvakam\u2014in a wrong\nway.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nWhatever a man may sacrifice to other gods, O son of Kunt\u012b, is really meant for\nMe alone, but it is offered without true understanding.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\n\u201cPersons who are engaged in the worship of demigods are not very intelligent,\nalthough such worship is done to Me indirectly,\u201d K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says. For example, when a\nman pours water on the leaves and branches of a tree without pouring water on\nthe root, he does so without sufficient knowledge or without observing\nregulative principles. Similarly, the process of rendering service to different\nparts of the body is to supply food to the stomach. The demigods are, so to\nspeak, different officers and directors in the government of the Supreme Lord.\nOne has to follow the laws made by the government, not by the officers or\ndirectors. Similarly, everyone is to offer his worship to the Supreme Lord only.\nThat will automatically satisfy the different officers and directors of the\nLord. The officers and directors are engaged as representatives of the\ngovernment, and to offer some bribe to the officers and directors is illegal.\nThis is stated here as avidhi-p\u016brvakam. In other words, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a does not approve\nthe unnecessary worship of the demigods.\n\n\n9.24\n\n\naha\u1e41 hi sarva-yaj\u00f1\u0101n\u0101\u1e41\n\n\nbhokt\u0101 ca prabhur eva ca\n\n\nna tu m\u0101m abhij\u0101nanti\n\n\ntattven\u0101ta\u015b cyavanti te\n\n\naham\u2014I; hi\u2014surely; sarva\u2014of all; yaj\u00f1\u0101n\u0101m\u2014sacrifices; bhokt\u0101\u2014enjoyer; ca\u2014and;\nprabhu\u1e25\u2014Lord; eva\u2014also; ca\u2014and; na\u2014not; tu\u2014but; m\u0101m\u2014Me; abhij\u0101nanti\u2014know;\ntattvena\u2014in reality; ata\u1e25\u2014therefore; cyavanti\u2014fall down; te\u2014they.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nI am the only enjoyer and the only object of sacrifice. Those who do not\nrecognize My true transcendental nature fall down.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nHere it is clearly stated that there are many types of yaj\u00f1a performances\nrecommended in the Vedic literatures, but actually all of them are meant for\nsatisfying the Supreme Lord. Yaj\u00f1a means Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. In the Second Chapter of\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 it is clearly stated that one should only work for satisfying\nYaj\u00f1a or Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. The perfectional form of human civilization, known as\nvar\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma, is specifically meant for satisfying Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Therefore, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nsays in this verse, \u201cI am the enjoyer of all sacrifices because I am the supreme\nmaster.\u201d However, less intelligent persons, without knowing this fact, worship\ndemigods for temporary benefit. Therefore they fall down to material existence\nand do not achieve the desired goal of life. If, however, anyone has any\nmaterial desire to be fulfilled, he had better pray for it to the Supreme Lord\n(although that is not pure devotion), and he will thus achieve the desired\nresult.\n\n\n9.25\n\n\ny\u0101nti deva-vrat\u0101 dev\u0101n\n\n\npit\u1e5dn y\u0101nti pit\u1e5b-vrat\u0101\u1e25\n\n\nbh\u016bt\u0101ni y\u0101nti bh\u016btejy\u0101\n\n\ny\u0101nti mad-y\u0101jino \u2019pi m\u0101m\n\n\ny\u0101nti\u2014achieve; deva-vrat\u0101\u1e25\u2014worshipers of demigods; dev\u0101n\u2014to demigods; pit\u1e5dn\u2014to\nancestors; y\u0101nti\u2014go; pit\u1e5b-vrat\u0101\u1e25\u2014worshipers of ancestors; bh\u016bt\u0101ni\u2014to ghosts and\nspirits; y\u0101nti\u2014go; bh\u016btejy\u0101\u1e25\u2014worshipers of ghosts and spirits; y\u0101nti\u2014go; mat\u2014My;\ny\u0101jina\u1e25\u2014devotees; api\u2014also; m\u0101m\u2014unto Me.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThose who worship the demigods will take birth among the demigods; those who\nworship ghosts and spirits will take birth among such beings; those who worship\nancestors go to the ancestors; and those who worship Me will live with Me.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nIf anyone has any desire to go to the moon, the sun, or any other planet, one\ncan attain the desired destination by following specific Vedic principles\nrecommended for that purpose. These are vividly described in the fruitive\nactivities portion of the Vedas, technically known as dar\u015ba-paur\u1e47am\u0101s\u012b, which\nrecommends a specific worship of demigods situated on different heavenly\nplanets. Similarly, one can attain the pit\u0101 planets by performing a specific\nyaj\u00f1a. Similarly, one can go to many ghostly planets and become a yak\u1e63a, rak\u1e63a\nor pi\u015b\u0101ca. Pi\u015b\u0101ca worship is called \u201cblack arts\u201d or \u201cblack magic.\u201d There are\nmany men who practice this black art, and they think that it is spiritualism,\nbut such activities are completely materialistic. Similarly, a pure devotee, who\nworships the Supreme Personality of Godhead only, achieves the planets of\nVaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aloka without a doubt. It is very easy to understand through\nthis important verse that if by simply worshiping the demigods one can achieve\nthe heavenly planets, or by worshiping the pit\u0101 achieve the pit\u0101 planets, or by\npracticing the black arts achieve the ghostly planets, why can the pure devotee\nnot achieve the planet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or Vi\u1e63\u1e47u? Unfortunately many people have no\ninformation of these sublime planets where K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Vi\u1e63\u1e47u live, and because\nthey do not know of them they fall down. Even the impersonalists fall down from\nthe brahmajyoti. This K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is therefore distributing\nsublime information to the entire human society to the effect that by simply\nchanting the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra one can become perfect in this life and go back\nhome, back to Godhead.\n\n\n9.26\n\n\npatra\u1e41 pu\u1e63pa\u1e41 phala\u1e41 toya\u1e41\n\n\nyo me bhakty\u0101 prayacchati\n\n\ntad aha\u1e41 bhakty-upah\u1e5btam\n\n\na\u015bn\u0101mi prayat\u0101tmana\u1e25\n\n\npatram\u2014a leaf; pu\u1e63pam\u2014a flower; phalam\u2014a fruit; toyam\u2014water; ya\u1e25\u2014whoever;\nme\u2014unto Me; bhakty\u0101\u2014with devotion; prayacchati\u2014offers; tat\u2014that; aham\u2014I;\nbhakti-upah\u1e5btam\u2014offered in devotion; a\u015bn\u0101mi\u2014accept; prayata-\u0101tmana\u1e25\u2014of one in\npure consciousness.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nIf one offers Me with love and devotion a leaf, a flower, fruit a water, I will\naccept it.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nHere Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, having established that He is the only enjoyer, the primeval\nLord, and the real object of all sacrificial offerings, reveals what types of\nsacrifices He desires to be offered. If one wishes to engage in devotional\nservice to the Supreme in order to be purified and to reach the goal of life\u2014the\ntranscendental loving service of God\u2014then he should find out what the Lord\ndesires of him. One who loves K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a will give Him whatever He wants, and he\navoids offering anything which is undesirable or unasked for. Thus, meat, fish\nand eggs should not be offered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. If He desired such things as offerings,\nHe would have said so. Instead He clearly requests that a leaf, fruit, flowers\nand water be given to Him, and He says of this offering, \u201cI will accept it.\u201d\nTherefore, we should understand that He will not accept meat, fish and eggs.\nVegetables, grains, fruits, milk and water are the proper foods for human beings\nand are prescribed by Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself. Whatever else we eat cannot be offered\nto Him, since He will not accept it. Thus we cannot be acting on the level of\nloving devotion if we offer such foods.\n\n\nIn the Third Chapter, verse thirteen, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a explains that only the remains\nof sacrifice are purified and fit for consumption by those who are seeking\nadvancement in life and release from the clutches of the material entanglement.\nThose who do not make an offering of their food, He says in the same verse, are\nsaid to be eating only sin. In other words, their every mouthful is simply\ndeepening their involvement in the complexities of material nature. But\npreparing nice, simple vegetable dishes, offering them before the picture or\nDeity of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and bowing down and praying for Him to accept such a humble\noffering, enable one to advance steadily in life, to purify the body, and to\ncreate fine brain tissues which will lead to clear thinking. Above all, the\noffering should be made with an attitude of love. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has no need of food,\nsince He already possesses everything that be, yet He will accept the offering\nof one who desires to please Him in that way. The important element, in\npreparation, in serving and in offering, is to act with love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\n\n\nThe impersonalist philosophers, who wish to maintain that the Absolute Truth is\nwithout senses, cannot comprehend this verse of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. To them, it is\neither a metaphor or proof of the mundane character of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the speaker of the\nG\u012bt\u0101. But, in actuality, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Godhead, has senses, and it is\nstated that His senses are interchangeable; in other words, one sense can\nperform the function of any other. This is what it means to say that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is\nabsolute. Lacking senses, He could hardly be considered full in all opulences.\nIn the Seventh Chapter, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has explained that He impregnates the living\nentities into material nature. This is done by His looking upon material nature.\nAnd so in this instance, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s hearing the devotee\u2019s words of love in offering\nfoodstuffs is wholly identical with His eating and actually tasting. This point\nshould be emphasized: because of His absolute position, His hearing is wholly\nidentical with His eating and tasting. Only the devotee, who accepts K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as He\ndescribes Himself, without interpretation, can understand that the Supreme\nAbsolute Truth can eat food and enjoy it.\n\n\n9.27\n\n\nyat karo\u1e63i yad a\u015bn\u0101si\n\n\nyaj juho\u1e63i dad\u0101si yat\n\n\nyat tapasyasi kaunteya\n\n\ntat kuru\u1e63va mad-arpa\u1e47am\n\n\nyat\u2014what; karo\u1e63i\u2014you do; yat\u2014whatever; a\u015bn\u0101si\u2014you eat; yat\u2014whatever; juho\u1e63i\u2014you\noffer; dad\u0101si\u2014you give away; yat\u2014whatever; yat\u2014whatever; tapasyasi\u2014austerities\nyou perform; kaunteya\u2014O son of Kunt\u012b; tat\u2014that; kuru\u1e63va\u2014make; mat\u2014unto Me;\narpa\u1e47am\u2014offering.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nO son of Kunt\u012b, all that you do, all that you eat, all that you offer and give\naway, as well as all austerities that you may perform, should be done as an\noffering unto Me.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThus, it is the duty of everyone to mold his life in such a way that he will not\nforget K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in any circumstance. Everyone has to work for maintenance of his\nbody and soul together, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a recommends herein that one should work for\nHim. Everyone has to eat something to live; therefore he should accept the\nremnants of foodstuffs offered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Any civilized man has to perform some\nreligious ritualistic ceremonies; therefore K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a recommends, \u201cDo it for Me,\u201d\nand this is called arcan\u0101. Everyone has a tendency to give something in charity;\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says, \u201cGive it to Me,\u201d and this means that all surplus money accummulated\nshould be utilized in furthering the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement. Nowadays\npeople are very much inclined to the meditational process, which is not\npractical in this age, but if anyone practices meditating on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a twenty-four\nhours by chanting the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra round his beads, he is surely the\ngreatest yog\u012b, as substantiated by the Sixth Chapter of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.\n\n\n9.28\n\n\n\u015bubh\u0101\u015bubha-phalair eva\u1e41\n\n\nmok\u1e63yase karma-bandhanai\u1e25\n\n\nsanny\u0101sa-yoga-yukt\u0101tm\u0101\n\n\nvimukto m\u0101m upai\u1e63yasi\n\n\n\u015bubha\u2014good; a\u015bubha\u2014evil; phalai\u1e25\u2014results; evam\u2014thus; mok\u1e63yase\u2014free;\nkarma\u2014action; bandhanai\u1e25\u2014bondage; sanny\u0101sa\u2014of renunciation; yoga\u2014the yoga;\nyukta-\u0101tm\u0101\u2014having the mind firmly set on; vimukta\u1e25\u2014liberated; m\u0101m\u2014to Me;\nupai\u1e63yasi\u2014you will attain.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nIn this way you will be freed from all reactions to good and evil deeds, and by\nthis principle of renunciation you will be liberated and come to Me.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nOne who acts in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness under superior direction is called yukta.\nThe technical term is yukta-vair\u0101gya. This is further explained by R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b\nas follows.\n\n\nR\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b says that as long as we are in this material world we have to act;\nwe cannot cease acting. Therefore if actions are performed and the fruits are\ngiven to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, then that is called yukta-vair\u0101gya. Actually situated in\nrenunciation, such activities clear the mirror of the mind, and as the actor\ngradually makes progress in spiritual realization he becomes completely\nsurrendered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore at the end he\nbecomes liberated, and this liberation is also specified. By this liberation he\ndoes not become one with the brahmajyoti but rather enters into the planet of\nthe Supreme Lord. It is clearly mentioned here: m\u0101m upai\u1e63yasi, \u201che comes to Me,\u201d\nback home, back to Godhead. There are five different stages of liberation, and\nhere it is specified that the devotee who has always lived his lifetime here\nunder the direction of the Supreme Lord, as stated, has evolved to the point\nwhere he can, after quitting this body, go back to Godhead and engage directly\nin the association of the Supreme Lord.\n\n\nAnyone who has no other interest but to dedicate his life to the service of the\nLord is actually a sanny\u0101s\u012b Such a person always thinks of himself as an eternal\nservant, dependant on the supreme will of the Lord. As such, whatever he does,\nhe does it for the benefit of the Lord. Whatever action he performs, he performs\nit as service to the Lord. He does not give serious attention to the fruitive\nactivities or prescribed duties mentioned in the Vedas. For ordinary persons it\nis obligatory to execute the prescribed duties mentioned in the Vedas, but\nalthough a pure devotee who is completely engaged in the service of the Lord may\nsometimes appear to go against the prescribed Vedic duties, actually it is not\nso.\n\n\nIt is said, therefore, by Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava authorities that even the most intelligent\nperson cannot understand the plans and activities of a pure devotee. The exact\nwords are vai\u1e63\u1e47avera kriy\u0101 mudr\u0101 vij\u00f1e n\u0101 bujhay\u0101. A person who is thus always\nengaged in the service of the Lord or is always thinking and planning how to\nserve the Lord is to be considered completely liberated at present and in the\nfuture. His going home, back to Godhead, is guaranteed. He is above all\nmaterialistic criticism, just as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is above all criticism.\n\n\n9.29\n\n\nsamo \u2019ha\u1e41 sarva-bh\u016bte\u1e63u\n\n\nna me dve\u1e63yo \u2019sti na priya\u1e25\n\n\nye bhajanti tu m\u0101\u1e41 bhakty\u0101\n\n\nmayi te te\u1e63u c\u0101py aham\n\n\nsama\u1e25\u2014equally disposed; aham\u2014I; sarva-bh\u016bte\u1e63u\u2014to all living entities; na\u2014no one;\nme\u2014Mine; dve\u1e63ya\u1e25\u2014hateful; asti\u2014is; na\u2014nor; priya\u1e25\u2014dear; ye\u2014those;\nbhajanti\u2014render transcendental service; tu\u2014yet; m\u0101m\u2014unto Me; bhakty\u0101\u2014in\ndevotion; mayi\u2014unto Me; te\u2014such persons; te\u1e63u\u2014in them; ca\u2014also; api\u2014certainly;\naham\u2014I.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nI envy no one, nor am I partial to anyone. I am equal to all. But whoever\nrenders service unto Me in devotion is a friend, is in Me, and I am also a\nfriend to him.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nOne may question here that if K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is equal to everyone and no one is His\nspecial friend, then why does He take a special interest in the devotees who are\nalways engaged in His transcendental service? But this is not discrimination; it\nis natural. Any man in this material world may be very charitably disposed, yet\nhe has a special interest in his own children. The Lord claims that every living\nentity\u2014in whatever form\u2014is His son, and as such He provides everyone with a\ngenerous supply of the necessities of life. He is just like a cloud which pours\nrain all over, regardless whether it falls on rock or land or water. But for His\ndevotees, He gives specific attention. Such devotees are mentioned here: they\nare always in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, and therefore they are always\ntranscendentally situated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The very phrase K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness suggests\nthat those who are in such consciousness are living transcendentalists, situated\nin Him. The Lord says here distinctly, \u201cmayi te,\u201d \u201cin Me.\u201d Naturally, as a\nresult, the Lord is also in them. This is reciprocal. This also explains the\nwords: asti na priya\u1e25/ye bhajanti: \u201cWhoever surrenders unto Me, proportionately\nI take care of him.\u201d This transcendental reciprocation exists because both the\nLord and the devotee are conscious. When a diamond is set in a golden ring, it\nlooks very nice. The gold is glorified, and at the same time the diamond is\nglorified. The Lord and the living entity eternally glitter, and when a living\nentity becomes inclined to the service of the Supreme Lord, he looks like gold.\nThe Lord is a diamond, and so this combination is very nice. Living entities in\na pure state are called devotees. The Supreme Lord becomes the devotee of His\ndevotees. If a reciprocal relationship is not present between the devotee and\nthe Lord, then there is no personalist philosophy. In the impersonal philosophy\nthere is no reciprocation between the Supreme and the living entity, but in the\npersonalist philosophy there is.\n\n\nThe example is often given that the Lord is like a desire tree, and whatever one\nwants from this desire tree, the Lord supplies. But here the explanation is more\ncomplete. The Lord is here stated to be partial to the devotees. This is the\nmanifestation of the Lord\u2019s special mercy to the devotees. The Lord\u2019s\nreciprocation should not be considered to be under the law of karma. It belongs\nto the transcendental situation in which the Lord and His devotees function.\nDevotional service of the Lord is not an activity of this material world; it is\npart of the spiritual world where eternity, bliss and knowledge predominate.\n\n\n9.30\n\n\napi cet su-dur\u0101c\u0101ro\n\n\nbhajate m\u0101m ananya-bh\u0101k\n\n\ns\u0101dhur eva sa mantavya\u1e25\n\n\nsamyag vyavasito hi sa\u1e25\n\n\napi\u2014in spite of; cet\u2014although; sudur\u0101c\u0101ra\u1e25\u2014one committing the most abominable\nactions; bhajate\u2014engaged in devotional service; m\u0101m\u2014unto Me; ananya-bh\u0101k\u2014without\ndeviation; s\u0101dhu\u1e25\u2014saint; eva\u2014certainly; sa\u1e25\u2014he; mantavya\u1e25\u2014to be considered;\nsamyak\u2014completely; vyavasita\u1e25\u2014situated; hi\u2014certainly; sa\u1e25\u2014he.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nEven if one commits the most abominable actions, if he is engaged in devotional\nservice, he is to be considered saintly because he is properly situated.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe word sudur\u0101c\u0101ro used in this verse is very significant, and we should\nunderstand it properly. When a living entity is conditioned, he has two kinds of\nactivities: one is conditional, and the other is constitutional. As for\nprotecting the body or abiding by the rules of society and state, certainly\nthere are different activities, even for the devotees, in connection with the\nconditional life, and such activities are called conditional. Besides these, the\nliving entity who is fully conscious of his spiritual nature and is engaged in\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, or the devotional service of the Lord, has activities which\nare called transcendental. Such activities are performed in his constitutional\nposition, and they are technically called devotional service. Now, in the\nconditioned state, sometimes devotional service and the conditional service in\nrelation to the body will parallel one another. But then again, sometimes these\nactivities become opposed to one another. As far as possible, a devotee is very\ncautious so that he does not do anything that could disrupt his wholesome\ncondition. He knows that perfection in his activities depends on his progressive\nrealization of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Sometimes, however, it may be seen that a\nperson in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness commits some act which may be taken as most\nabominable socially or politically. But such a temporary falldown does not\ndisqualify him. In the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam it is stated that if a person falls\ndown, but is wholeheartedly engaged in the transcendental service of the Supreme\nLord, the Lord, being situated within his heart, beautifies him and excuses him\nfrom that abomination. The material contamination is so strong that even a yog\u012b\nfully engaged in the service of the Lord sometimes becomes ensnared; but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness is so strong that such an occasional falldown is at once\nrectified. Therefore the process of devotional service is always a success. No\none should deride a devotee for some accidental falldown from the ideal path,\nfor, as is explained in the next verse, such occasional falldowns will be\nstopped in due course, as soon as a devotee is completely situated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness.\n\n\nTherefore a person who is situated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and is engaged with\ndetermination in the process of chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a,\nHare Hare/Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare should be considered to be\nin the transcendental position, even if by chance or accident he is found to\nhave fallen. The words s\u0101dhur eva, \u201che is saintly,\u201d are very emphatic. They are\na warning to the nondevotees that because of an accidental falldown a devotee\nshould not be derided; he should still be considered saintly even if he has\nfallen down accidentally. And the word mantavya\u1e25 is still more emphatic. If one\ndoes not follow this rule, and derides a devotee for his accidental falldown,\nthen he is disobeying the order of the Supreme Lord. The only qualification of a\ndevotee is to be unflinchingly and exclusively engaged in devotional service.\n\n\nThe mark of a spot which may be seen on the moon does not become an impediment\nto the moonlight. Similarly, the accidental falldown of a devotee from the path\nof a saintly character does not make him abominable. On the other hand, one\nshould not misunderstand that a devotee in transcendental devotional service can\nact in all kinds of abominable ways; this verse only refers to an accident due\nto the strong power of material connections. Devotional service is more or less\na declaration of war against the illusory energy. As long as one is not strong\nenough to fight the illusory energy, there may be accidental falldowns. But when\none is strong enough, he is no longer subjected to such falldowns, as previously\nexplained. No one should take advantage of this verse and commit nonsense and\nthink that he is still a devotee. If he does not improve in his character by\ndevotional service, then it is to be understood that he is not a high devotee.\n\n\n9.31\n\n\nk\u1e63ipra\u1e41 bhavati dharm\u0101tm\u0101\n\n\n\u015ba\u015bvac-ch\u0101nti\u1e41 nigacchati\n\n\nkaunteya pratij\u0101n\u012bhi\n\n\nna me bhakta\u1e25 pra\u1e47a\u015byati\n\n\nk\u1e63ipram\u2014very soon; bhavati\u2014becomes; dharma-\u0101tm\u0101\u2014righteous; \u015ba\u015bvat-\u015b\u0101ntim\u2014lasting\npeace; nigacchati\u2014attains; kaunteya\u2014O son of Kunt\u012b; pratij\u0101n\u012bhi\u2014justly declare;\nna\u2014never; me\u2014Mine; bhakta\u1e25\u2014devotee; pra\u1e47a\u015byati\u2014perishes.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nHe quickly becomes righteous and attains lasting peace. O son of Kunt\u012b, declare\nit boldly that My devotee never perishes.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThis should not be misunderstood. In the Seventh Chapter the Lord says that one\nwho is engaged in mischievous activities cannot become a devotee of the Lord.\nOne who is not a devotee of the Lord has no good qualifications whatsoever. The\nquestion remains, then, how can a person engaged in abominable activities\u2014either\nby accident or intention\u2014be a pure devotee? This question may justly be raised.\nThe miscreants, as stated in the Seventh Chapter, who never come to the\ndevotional service of the Lord, have no good qualifications, as is stated in the\n\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. Generally, a devotee who is engaged in the nine kinds of\ndevotional activities is engaged in the process of cleansing all material\ncontamination from the heart. He puts the Supreme Personality of Godhead within\nhis heart, and all sinful contaminations are naturally washed away. Continuous\nthinking of the Supreme Lord makes him pure by nature. According to the Vedas,\nthere is a certain regulation that if one falls down from his exalted position,\nhe has to undergo certain ritualistic processes to purify himself. But here\nthere is no such condition because the purifying process is already there in the\nheart of the devotee, due to his remembering the Supreme Personality of Godhead\nconstantly. Therefore, the chanting of Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare\nHare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare should be continued without\nstoppage. This will protect a devotee from all accidental falldowns. He will\nthus remain perpetually free from all material contaminations.\n\n\n9.32\n\n\nm\u0101\u1e41 hi p\u0101rtha vyap\u0101\u015britya\n\n\nye \u2019pi syu\u1e25 p\u0101pa-yonaya\u1e25\n\n\nstriyo vai\u015by\u0101s tath\u0101 \u015b\u016bdr\u0101s\n\n\nte \u2019pi y\u0101nti par\u0101\u1e41 gatim\n\n\nm\u0101m\u2014unto Me; hi\u2014certainly; p\u0101rtha\u2014O son of P\u1e5bth\u0101; vyap\u0101\u015br\u012btya\u2014particularly\ntaking shelter; ye\u2014anyone; api\u2014also; syu\u1e25\u2014becomes; p\u0101pa-yonaya\u1e25\u2014born of a lower\nfamily; striya\u1e25\u2014women; vai\u015by\u0101\u1e25\u2014mercantile people; tath\u0101\u2014also; \u015b\u016bdr\u0101\u1e25\u2014lower class\nmen; te api\u2014even they; y\u0101nti\u2014go; par\u0101m\u2014supreme; gatim\u2014destination.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nO son of P\u1e5bth\u0101, those who take shelter in Me, though they be of lower\nbirth\u2014women, vai\u015byas [merchants], as well as \u015b\u016bdras [workers]\u2014can approach the\nsupreme destination.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nIt is clearly declared here by the Supreme Lord that in devotional service there\nis no distinction between the lower or higher classes of people. In the material\nconception of life, there are such divisions, but for a person engaged in\ntranscendental devotional service to the Lord, there are not. Everyone is\neligible for the supreme destination. In the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam it is stated that\neven the lowest, who are called ca\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101las (dog-eaters), can be elevated by\nassociation with a pure devotee. Therefore devotional service and guidance of a\npure devotee are so strong that there is no discrimination between the lower and\nhigher classes of men; anyone can take to it. The most simple man taking center\nof the pure devotee can be purified by proper guidance. According to the\ndifferent modes of material nature, men are classified in the mode of goodness\n(br\u0101hma\u1e47as), the mode of passion (k\u1e63atriyas, or administrators), the mixed modes\nof passion and ignorance (vai\u015byas, or merchants), and the mode of ignorance\n(\u015b\u016bdras, or workers). Those lower than them are called ca\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101las, and they are\nborn in sinful families. Generally, those who are born in sinful families are\nnot accepted by the higher classes. But the process of devotional service and\nthe pure devotee of the Supreme God are so strong that all the lower classes can\nattain the highest perfection of life. This is possible only when one takes\ncenter of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. One has to take center completely of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Then one can become\nmuch greater than great j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs and yog\u012bs.\n\n\n9.33\n\n\nki\u1e41 punar br\u0101hma\u1e47\u0101\u1e25 pu\u1e47y\u0101\n\n\nbhakt\u0101 r\u0101jar\u1e63ayas tath\u0101\n\n\nanityam asukha\u1e41 lokam\n\n\nima\u1e41 pr\u0101pya bhajasva m\u0101m\n\n\nkim\u2014how much; puna\u1e25\u2014again; br\u0101hma\u1e47\u0101\u1e25\u2014br\u0101hma\u1e47as; pu\u1e47y\u0101\u1e25\u2014righteous;\nbhakt\u0101\u1e25\u2014devotees; r\u0101jar\u1e63aya\u1e25\u2014saintly kings; tath\u0101\u2014also; anityam\u2014temporary;\nasukham\u2014sorrowful; lokam\u2014planets; imam\u2014this; pr\u0101pya\u2014gaining; bhajasva\u2014are\nengaged in loving service; m\u0101m\u2014unto Me.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nHow much greater then are the br\u0101hma\u1e47as, the righteous, the devotees and saintly\nkings who in this temporary miserable world engage in loving service unto Me.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nIn this material world there are classifications of people, but, after all, this\nworld is not a happy place for anyone. It is clearly stated here, anityam\nasukha\u1e41 lokam: this world is temporary and full of miseries, not habitable for\nany sane gentleman. This world is declared by the Supreme Personality of Godhead\nto be temporary and full of miseries. Some of the philosophers, especially the\nminor philosophers, say that this world is false, but we can understand from\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that the world is not false; it is temporary. There is a\ndifference between temporary and false. This world is temporary, but there is\nanother world which is eternal. This world is miserable, but the other world is\neternal and blissful.\n\n\nArjuna was born in a saintly royal family.

Everyone\nshould attach himself to the bosom of the Supreme Personality of Godhead so that\nhe can be eternally happy. The devotional service of the Supreme Lord is the\nonly process by which all problems of all classes of men can be solved.

Unfortunately, unscrupulous commentators divert\nthe mind of the reader to that which is not at all feasible. Such commentators\ndo not know that there is no difference between K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s mind and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is\nnot an ordinary human being; He is Absolute Truth. His body, mind and He Himself\nare one and absolute. It is stated in the K\u016brma Pur\u0101\u1e47a, as it is quoted by\nBhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b Gosv\u0101m\u012b in his Anubh\u0101\u1e63ya comments on\nCaitanya-carit\u0101mrta, Fifth Chapter, \u0100di-l\u012bl\u0101, verses 41\u201348, \u201cdeha-dehi-vibhedo\n\u2019ya\u1e41 ne\u015bvare vidyate kvacit,\u201d which means that there is no difference in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a,\nthe Supreme Lord, between Himself and His body. But, because they do not know\nthis science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the commentators hide K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and divide His personality\nfrom His mind or from His body. Although this is sheer ignorance of the science\nof K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, some men make profit out of misleading the people.\n\n\nThere are some who are demonic; they also think of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but enviously, just\nlike King Ka\u1e41sa, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s uncle. He was also thinking of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a always, but he\nthought of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as his enemy. He was always in anxiety, wondering when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nwould come to kill him. That kind of thinking will not help us. One should be\nthinking of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in devotional love. That is bhakti. One should cultivate the\nknowledge of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a continually. What is that favorable cultivation? It is to\nlearn from a bona fide teacher. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and\nwe have several times explained that His body is not material, but is eternal,\nblissful knowledge. This kind of talk about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a will help one become a\ndevotee. Otherwise, understanding K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a from the wrong source will prove\nfruitless.\n\n\nOne should therefore engage his mind in the eternal form, the primal form of\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; with conviction in his heart that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme, he should engage\nhimself in worship. There are hundreds of thousands of temples in India for the\nworship of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and devotional service is practiced there. When such practice\nis made, one has to offer obeisances to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. One should lower his head before\nthe Deity and engage his mind, his body, his activities\u2014everything. That will\nmake one fully absorbed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a without deviation. This will help one transfer\ninto the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aloka. One should not be deviated by unscrupulous commentators. One\nmust engage in the nine different processes of devotional service, beginning\nwith hearing and chanting about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Pure devotional service is the highest\nachievement of human society.\n\n\nIn the Seventh and Eighth Chapters of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, pure devotional service to\nthe Lord has been explained, apart from the yoga of knowledge and mystic yoga or\nfruitive activities. Those who are not purely sanctified may be attracted by\ndifferent features of the Lord, like the impersonal brahmajyoti and localized\nParam\u0101tm\u0101, but a pure devotee directly takes to the service of the Supreme Lord.\n\n\nThere is a beautiful poem about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in which it is clearly stated that any\nperson who is engaged in the worship of demigods is most unintelligent and\ncannot achieve at any time the supreme award of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The devotee, in the\nbeginning, may sometimes fall from the standard, but still he should be\nconsidered superior to all other philosophers and yog\u012bs. One who always engages\nin K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness should be understood to be the perfect saintly person.\nHis accidental nondevotional activities will diminish, and he will soon be\nsituated without any doubt in complete perfection. The pure devotee has no\nactual chance to fall down because the Supreme Godhead personally takes care of\nHis pure devotees. Therefore, the intelligent person should take directly to\nthis process of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and happily live in this material world. He\nwill eventually receive the supreme award of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",

TRANSLATION  The Supreme Lord said: My dear Arjuna, because you are never envious of Me, I\nshall impart to you this most secret wisdom, knowing which you shall be relieved\nof the miseries of material existence.  PURPORT  As a devotee hears more and more about the Supreme Lord, he becomes enlightened.\nThis hearing process is recommended in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam: \u201cThe messages of\nthe Supreme Personality of Godhead are full of potencies, and these potencies\ncan be realized if topics regarding the Supreme Godhead are discussed amongst\ndevotees. This cannot be achieved by the association of mental speculators or\nacademic scholars, for it is realized knowledge.\u201d  The devotees are constantly engaged in the Supreme Lord\u2019s service. The Lord\nunderstands the mentality and sincerity of a particular living entity who is\nengaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and gives him the intelligence to understand the\nscience of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in the association of the devotees. Discussion of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is very\npotent, and if a fortunate person has such association and tries to assimilate\nthe knowledge, then he will surely make advancement toward spiritual\nrealization. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, in order to encourage Arjuna to higher and higher\nelevation in His potent service, describes in this Ninth Chapter matters more\nconfidential than any He has already disclosed.  The very beginning of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, the First Chapter, is more or less an\nintroduction to the rest of the book; and in the Second and Third Chapters, the\nspiritual knowledge described is called confidential. Topics discussed in the\nSeventh and Eighth Chapters are specifically related to devotional service, and\nbecause they bring enlightenment in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, they are called more\nconfidential. But the matters which are described in the Ninth Chapter deal with\nunalloyed, pure devotion. Therefore this is called the most confidential. One\nwho is situated in the most confidential knowledge of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is naturally\ntranscendental; he therefore has no material pangs, although he is in the\nmaterial world. In the Bhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu it is said that although one who\nhas a sincere desire to render loving service to the Supreme Lord is situated in  the conditional state of material existence, he is to be considered liberated.\nSimilarly, we shall find in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, Tenth Chapter, that anyone who is\nengaged in that way is a liberated person.  Now this first verse has specific significance. Knowledge (ida\u1e41 j\u00f1\u0101nam) refers\nto pure devotional service, which consists of nine different activities:\nhearing, chanting, remembering, serving, worshiping, praying, obeying,\nmaintaining friendship and surrendering everything. By the practice of these\nnine elements of devotional service one is elevated to spiritual consciousness,\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. At the time when one\u2019s heart is cleared of the material\ncontamination, one can understand this science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Simply to understand\nthat a living entity is not material is not sufficient. That may be the\nbeginning of spiritual realization, but one should recognize the difference\nbetween activities of the body and spiritual activities by which one understands\nthat he is not the body.  In the Seventh Chapter we have already discussed the opulent potency of the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead, His different energies, the inferior and\nsuperior natures, and all this material manifestation. Now in Chapters Nine and\nTen the glories of the Lord will be delineated.  The Sanskrit word anas\u016byave in this verse is also very significant. Generally\nthe commentators, even if they are highly scholarly, are all envious of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a,\nthe Supreme Personality of Godhead. Even the most erudite scholars write on\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 very inaccurately. Because they are envious of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, their\ncommentaries are useless. The commentaries given by devotees of the Lord are\nbona fide. No one can explain Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, or give perfect knowledge of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nif he is envious. One who criticizes the character of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a without knowing Him\nis a fool. So such commentaries should be very carefully avoided. For one who\nunderstands that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the pure and\ntranscendental Personality, these chapters will be very beneficial.",

TRANSLATION  This knowledge is the king of education, the most secret of all secrets. It is\nthe purest knowledge, and because it gives direct perception of the self by\nrealization, it is the perfection of religion. It is everlasting, and it is\njoyfully performed.  PURPORT  This chapter of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is called the king of education because it is the\nessence of all doctrines and philosophies explained before. There are seven\nprincipal philosophers in India: Gautama, Ka\u1e47\u0101da, Kapila, Y\u0101j\u00f1avalkya, \u015a\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dilya,\nVai\u015bv\u0101nara, and, finally, Vy\u0101sadeva, the author of the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra. So there\nis no dearth of knowledge in the field of philosophy or transcendental\nknowledge. Now the Lord says that this Ninth Chapter is the king of all such\nknowledge, the essence of all knowledge that can be derived from the study of\nthe Vedas and different kinds of philosophy. It is the most confidential because\nconfidential or transcendental knowledge involves understanding the difference\nbetween the soul and the body. And the king of all confidential knowledge\nculminates in devotional service.  Generally, people are not educated in this confidential knowledge; they are\neducated in external knowledge. As far as ordinary education is concerned,\npeople are involved with so many departments: politics, sociology, physics,\nchemistry, mathematics, astronomy, engineering, etc. There are so many\ndepartments of knowledge all over the world and many huge universities, but\nthere is, unfortunately, no university or educational institution where the\nscience of the spirit soul is instructed. Yet the soul is the most important\npart of this body; without the presence of the soul, the body has no value.\nStill people are placing great stress on the bodily necessities of life, not\ncaring for the vital soul.  The Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, especially from the Second Chapter on, stresses the\nimportance of the soul. In the very beginning, the Lord says that this body is\nperishable and that the soul is not perishable. That is a confidential part of\nknowledge: simply knowing that spirit soul is different from this body and that\nits nature is immutable, indestructible and eternal. But that gives no positive\ninformation about the soul. Sometimes people are under the impression that the\nsoul is different from the body and that when the body is finished, or one is\nliberated from the body, the soul remains in a void and becomes impersonal. But\nactually that is not the fact. How can the soul, which is so active within this\nbody, be inactive after being liberated from the body? It is always active. If\nit is eternal, then it is eternally active, and its activities in the spiritual\nkingdom are the most confidential part of spiritual knowledge. These activities\nof the spirit soul are therefore indicated here as constituting the king of all\nknowledge, the most confidential part of all knowledge.  This knowledge is the purest form of all activities, as is explained in Vedic\nliterature. In the Padma Pur\u0101\u1e47a, man\u2019s sinful activities have been analyzed and\nare shown to be the results of sin after sin. Those who are engaged in fruitive\nactivities are entangled in different stages and forms of sinful reactions. For\ninstance, when the seed of a particular tree is sown, the tree does not appear\nimmediately to grow; it takes some time. It is first a small, sprouting plant,\nthen it assumes the form of a tree, then it flowers, bears fruit, and, when it\nis complete, the flowers and fruits are enjoyed by persons who have sown the\nseed of the tree. Similarly, a man performs a sinful act, and like a seed it\ntakes time to fructify. There are different stages. The sinful action may have\nalready stopped within the individual, but the results or the fruit of that\nsinful action are still enjoyed. There are sins which are still in the form of a\nseed, and there are others which are already fructified and are giving us fruit,\nwhich we are enjoying as distress and pain, as explained in the twentieth verse\nof the Seventh Chapter.  A person who has completely ended the reactions of all sinful activities and who\nis fully engaged in pious activities, being freed from the duality of this\nmaterial world, becomes engaged in devotional service to the Supreme Personality\nof Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In other words, those who are actually engaged in the\ndevotional service of the Supreme Lord are already freed from all reactions. For\nthose who are engaged in the devotional service of the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead, all sinful reactions, whether fructified, in the stock, or in the form\nof a seed, gradually vanish. Therefore the purifying potency of devotional\nservice is very strong, and it is called pavitram uttamam, the purest. Uttamam\nmeans transcendental. Tamas means this material world or darkness, and uttamam\nmeans that which is transcendental to material activities. Devotional activities\nare never to be considered material, although sometimes it appears that devotees\nare engaged just like ordinary men. One who can see and is familiar with\ndevotional service, however, will know that they are not material activities.\nThey are all spiritual and devotional, uncontaminated by the material modes of\nnature.  It is said that the execution of devotional service is so perfect that one can\nperceive the results directly. This direct result is actually perceived, and we\nhave practical experience that any person who is chanting the holy names of\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma,\nR\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare) in course of time feels some transcendental pleasure and\nvery quickly becomes purified of all material contamination. This is actually\nseen. Furthermore, if one engages not only in hearing but in trying to broadcast\nthe message of devotional activities as well, or if he engages himself in\nhelping the missionary activities of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, he gradually feels\nspiritual progress. This advancement in spiritual life does not depend on any\nkind of previous education or qualification. The method itself is so pure that\nby simply engaging in it one becomes pure.  In the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra this is also described in the following words: prak\u0101\u015ba\u015b ca\nkarma\u1e47y abhy\u0101s\u0101t. \u201cDevotional service is so potent that simply by engaging in\nthe activities of devotional service, one becomes enlightened without a doubt.\u201d\nN\u0101rada, who happened to be the son of a maidservant, had no education, nor was\nhe born into a high family. But when his mother was engaged in serving great\ndevotees, N\u0101rada also became engaged, and sometimes, in the absence of his\nmother, he would serve the great devotees himself. N\u0101rada personally says, \u201cOnce\nonly, by their permission, I took the remnants of their food, and by so doing\nall my sins were at once eradicated. Thus being engaged, I became purified in\nheart, and at that time the very nature of the transcendentalist became\nattractive to me.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 1.5.25) N\u0101rada tells his disciple Vy\u0101sadeva that in a\nprevious life he was engaged as a boy servant of purified devotees during four\nmonths of their stay and that he was intimately associating with them. Sometimes\nthose sages left remnants of food on their dishes, and the boy, who would wash\ntheir dishes, wanted to taste the remnants. So he asked the great devotees\nwhether he could eat them, and they gave their permission. N\u0101rada then ate those\nremnants and consequently became freed from all sinful reactions. As he went on\neating, he gradually became as purehearted as the sages, and he gradually\ndeveloped the same taste. The great devotees relished the taste of unceasing\ndevotional service of the Lord, hearing, chanting, etc., and by developing the\nsame taste, N\u0101rada wanted also to hear and chant the glories of the Lord. Thus\nby associating with the sages, he developed a great desire for devotional\nservice. Therefore he quotes from the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra (prak\u0101\u015ba\u015b ca karma\u1e47y\nabhy\u0101s\u0101t): If one is engaged simply in the acts of devotional service,\neverything is revealed to him automatically, and he can understand. This is\ncalled prak\u0101\u015ba\u1e25, directly perceived.  N\u0101rada was actually a son of a maidservant. He had no opportunity to go to\nschool. He was simply assisting his mother, and fortunately his mother rendered\nsome service to the devotees. The child N\u0101rada also got the opportunity and\nsimply by association achieved the highest goal of all religions, devotional\nservice. In the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam it is said that religious people generally do\nnot know that the highest perfection of religion is the attainment of the stage\nof devotional service. Generally Vedic knowledge is required for the\nunderstanding of the path of self-realization. But here, although he was not\neducated in the Vedic principle, N\u0101rada acquired the highest results of Vedic\nstudy. This process is so potent that even without performing the religious\nprocess regularly, one can be raised to the highest perfection. How is this\npossible? This is also confirmed in Vedic literature: \u0101c\u0101ryav\u0101n puru\u1e63o veda. One\nwho is in association with great \u0101c\u0101ryas, even if he is not educated or has not\nstudied the Vedas, can become familiar with all the knowledge necessary for\nrealization.  The process of devotional service is a very happy one. Why? Devotional service\nconsists of \u015brava\u1e47a\u1e41 k\u012brtana\u1e41 vi\u1e63\u1e47o\u1e25, so one can simply hear the chanting of the\nglories of the Lord or can attend philosophical lectures on transcendental\nknowledge given by authorized \u0101c\u0101ryas. Simply by sitting, one can learn; then\none can eat the remnants of the food offered to God, nice palatable dishes. In\nevery state devotional service is joyful. One can execute devotional service\neven in the most poverty-stricken condition. The Lord says, patra\u1e41 pu\u1e63pa\u1e41\nphalam: He is ready to accept from the devotee any kind of offering, never mind\nwhat. Even a leaf, a flower, a bit of fruit, or a little water, which are all\navailable in every part of the world, can be offered by any person, regardless\nof social position, and will be accepted if offered with love. There are many\ninstances in history. Simply by tasting the tulas\u012b leaves offered to the lotus\nfeet of the Lord, great sages like Sanatkum\u0101ra became great devotees. Therefore\nthe devotional process is very nice, and it can be executed in a happy mood. God\naccepts only the love with which things are offered to Him.  It is said here that this devotional service is eternally existing. It is not as\nthe M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophers claim. They sometimes take to so-called devotional\nservice, and as long as they are not liberated they continue their devotional\nservice, but at the end, when they become liberated, they \u201cbecome one with God.\u201d\nSuch temporary time-serving devotional service is not accepted as pure\ndevotional service. Actual devotional service continues even after liberation.\nWhen the devotee goes to the spiritual planet in the kingdom of God, he is also\nengaged there in serving the Supreme Lord. He does not try to become one with\nthe Supreme Lord.  As it will be seen, actual devotional service begins after liberation. So in\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 it is said, brahma-bh\u016bta. After being liberated, or being situated\nin the Brahman position, one\u2019s devotional service begins. By executing\ndevotional service, one can understand the Supreme Lord. No one can understand\nthe Supreme Personality of Godhead by executing karma-yoga, j\u00f1\u0101na, or\na\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45ga-yoga or any other yoga independantly. Without coming to the stage of\ndevotional service, one cannot understand what is the Personality of Godhead. In\nthe \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam it is also confirmed that when one becomes purified by\nexecuting the process of devotional service, especially by hearing\n\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam or Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 from realized souls, then he can understand\nthe science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or the science of God. Eva\u1e41 prasanna-manaso\nbhagavad-bhakti-yogata\u1e25. When one\u2019s heart is cleared of all nonsense, then one\ncan understand what God is. Thus the process of devotional service, of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness, is the king of all education and the king of all confidential\nknowledge. It is the purest form of religion, and it can be executed joyfully\nwithout difficulty. Therefore one should adopt it.",

Faith is created by association with devotees.\nUnfortunate people, even after hearing all the evidence of Vedic literature from\ngreat personalities, still have no faith in God. They are hesitant and cannot\nstay fixed in the devotional service of the Lord. Thus faith is a most important\nfactor for progress in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. In the Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta it is\nsaid that one should have complete conviction that simply by serving the Supreme\nLord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a he can achieve all perfection.

In the\n\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (3.4.12) it is stated that by giving water to the root of a\ntree, its branches, twigs and leaves become satisfied, and by supplying food to\nthe stomach all the senses of the body become satisfied, and, similarly, by\nengaging in the transcendental service of the Supreme Lord, all the demigods and\nall the living entities automatically become satisfied.  After reading Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 one should promptly come to the conclusion of\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101: one should give up all other engagements and adopt the service of\nthe Supreme Lord, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Personality of Godhead. If one is convinced of this\nphilosophy of life, that is faith. Now the development of that faith is the\nprocess of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.  There are three divisions of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious men. In the third class are those\nwho have no faith. If they are engaged in devotional service officially, for\nsome ulterior purpose, they cannot achieve the highest perfectional stage. Most\nprobably they will slip, after some time. They may become engaged, but because\nthey haven\u2019t complete conviction and faith, it is very difficult for them to\ncontinue in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. We have practical experience in discharging our\nmissionary activity that some people come and apply themselves to the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness with some hidden motive, and as soon as they are economically a\nlittle well-situated, they give up this process and take to their old ways\nagain. It is only by faith that one can advance in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. As far\nas the development of faith is concerned, one who is well versed in the\nliteratures of devotional service and has attained the stage of firm faith is\ncalled a first-class person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. And in the second class are\nthose who are not very advanced in understanding the devotional scriptures but\nwho automatically have firm faith that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a bhakti or service to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the\nbest course and so in good faith have taken it up. Thus they are superior to the\nthird class who have neither perfect knowledge of the scriptures nor good faith\nbut by association and simplicity are trying to follow. The third-class person\nin K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness may fall down, but when one is in the second class or\nfirst class, he does not fall down. One in the first class will surely make\nprogress and achieve the result at the end. As far as the third-class person in\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is concerned, although he has faith in the conviction that\ndevotional service to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is very good, he has no knowledge of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a through\nthe scriptures like \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam and Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Sometimes these\nthird-class persons in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness have some tendency toward karma-yoga\nand j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga, and sometimes they are disturbed, but as soon as the infection\nof karma-yoga or j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga is vanquished, they become second-class or\nfirst-class persons in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Faith in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is also divided into\nthree stages and described in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. First-class attachment,\nsecond-class attachment, and third-class attachment are also explained in\n\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam in the Eleventh Canto. Those who have no faith even after\nhearing about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and the excellence of devotional service, who think that it\nis simply eulogy, find the path very difficult, even if they are supposedly\nengaged in devotional service. For them there is very little hope in gaining\nperfection. Thus faith is very important in the discharge of devotional service.",

TRANSLATION  By Me, in My unmanifested form, this entire universe is pervaded. All beings are\nin Me, but I am not in them.  PURPORT  The Supreme Personality of Godhead is not perceivable through the gross material\nsenses. It is said that Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s name, fame, pastimes, etc., cannot be\nunderstood by material senses. Only to one who is engaged in pure devotional\nservice under proper guidance is He revealed. In the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 it is\nstated, prem\u0101\u00f1janacchurita.\u2026 One can see the Supreme Personality of Godhead,\nGovinda, always within himself and outside himself if he has developed the\ntranscendental loving attitude towards Him. Thus for people in general He is not\nvisible. Here it is said that although He is all-pervading, everywhere present,\nHe is yet not conceivable by the material senses. But actually, although we\ncannot see Him, everything is resting in Him. As we have discussed in the\nSeventh Chapter, the entire material cosmic manifestation is only a combination\nof His two different energies, the superior spiritual energy and the inferior\nmaterial energy. Just as the sunshine is spread all over the universe, the\nenergy of the Lord is spread all over the creation, and everything is resting in\nthat energy.  Yet one should not conclude that because He is spread all over He has lost His\npersonal existence. To refute such argument the Lord says, \u201cI am everywhere, and\neverything is in Me, but still I am aloof.\u201d For example, a king heads a\ngovernment which is but the manifestation of the king\u2019s energy; the different\ngovernmental departments are nothing but the energies of the king, and each\ndepartment is resting on the king\u2019s power. But still one cannot expect the king\nto be present in every department personally. That is a crude example.\nSimilarly, all the manifestations that we see, and everything that exists both\nin this material world and in the spiritual world, are resting on the energy of\nthe Supreme Personality of Godhead. The creation takes place by the diffusion of\nHis different energies, and, as is stated in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, He is everywhere\npresent by His personal representation, the diffusion of His different energies.",

TRANSLATION  And yet everything that is created does not rest in Me. Behold My mystic\nopulence! Although I am the maintainer of all living entities, and although I am\neverywhere, still My Self is the very source of creation.  PURPORT  The Lord says that everything is resting on Him. This should not be\nmisunderstood. The Lord is not directly concerned with the maintenance and\nsustenance of this material manifestation. Sometimes we see a picture of Atlas\nholding the globe on his shoulders; he seems to be very tired, holding this\ngreat earthly planet. Such an image should not be entertained in connection with\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s upholding this created universe. He says that although everything is\nresting on Him, still He is aloof. The planetary systems are floating in space,\nand this space is the energy of the Supreme Lord. But He is different from\nspace. He is differently situated. Therefore the Lord says, \u201cAlthough they are\nsituated on My inconceivable energy, still, as the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead, I am aloof from them.\u201d This is the inconceivable opulence of the Lord.  In the Vedic dictionary it is said, \u201cThe Supreme Lord is performing\ninconceivably wonderful pastimes, displaying His energy. His person is full of\ndifferent potent energies, and His determination is itself actual fact. In this\nway the Personality of Godhead is to be understood.\u201d We may think to do\nsomething, but there are so many impediments, and sometimes it is not possible\nto do as we like. But when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a wants to do something, simply by His willing,\neverything is performed so perfectly that one cannot imagine how it is being\ndone. The Lord explains this fact: although He is the maintainer and sustainer\nof all material manifestation, He does not touch this material manifestation.\nSimply by His supreme will everything is created, everything is sustained,\neverything is maintained, and everything is annihilated. There is no difference\nbetween His mind and Himself (as there is a difference between ourselves and our\npresent material mind) because He is absolute spirit. Simultaneously the Lord is\npresent in everything; yet the common man cannot understand how He is also\npresent personally. He is different from this material manifestation, yet\neverything is resting on Him. This is explained here as yogam ai\u015bvaram, the\nmystic power of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.",

TRANSLATION  As the mighty wind, blowing everywhere, always rests in ethereal space know that\nin the same manner all beings rest in Me.  PURPORT  For the ordinary person it is almost inconceivable how the huge material\ncreation is resting in Him. But the Lord is giving an example which may help us\nto understand. Space is the biggest manifestation we can conceive. The cosmic\nmanifestation rests in space. Space permits the movement of even the atoms and\non up to the greatest planets, the sun and the moon. Although the sky (or wind\nor air) is great, still it is situated within space. Space is not beyond the\nsky.  Similarly, all the wonderful cosmic manifestations are existing by the supreme\nwill of God, and all of them are subordinate to that supreme will. As we\ngenerally say, not a blade of grass moves without the will of the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead. Thus everything is moving under His will: by His will\neverything is being created, everything is being maintained, and everything is\nbeing annihilated. Still He is aloof from everything, as space is always aloof\nfrom the activities of the atmosphere. In the Upani\u1e63ads, it is stated, \u201cIt is\nout of the fear of the Supreme Lord that the wind is blowing.\u201d In the Garga\nUpani\u1e63ad also it is stated, \u201cBy the supreme order, under the superintendence of\nthe Supreme Personality of Godhead, the moon, the sun and the great planets are\nmoving.\u201d In the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 this is also stated. There is also a description\nof the movement of the sun, and it is said that the sun is considered to be one\nof the eyes of the Supreme Lord and that it has immense potency to diffuse heat\nand light. Still it is moving in its prescribed orbit by the order and the\nsupreme will of Govinda. So, from the Vedic literature we can find evidence that\nthis material manifestation, which appears to us to be very wonderful and great,\nis under the complete control of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This will\nbe further explained in the later verses of this chapter.",

TRANSLATION  The whole cosmic order is under Me. By My will it is manifested again and again,\nand by My will it is annihilated at the end.  PURPORT  This matter is the manifestation of the inferior energy of the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead. This has already been explained several times. At the\ncreation, the material energy is let loose as mahat-tattva, into which the Lord\nas His first Puru\u1e63a incarnation, Mah\u0101-Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, enters. He lies within the Causal\nOcean and breathes out innumerable universes, and into each universe the Lord\nagain enters as Garbhodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Each universe is in that way created. He\nstill further manifests Himself as K\u1e63\u012brodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, and that Vi\u1e63\u1e47u enters\ninto everything\u2014even into the minute atom. This fact is explained here. He\nenters into everything.  Now, as far as the living entities are concerned, they are impregnated into this\nmaterial nature, and as a result of their past deeds they take different\npositions. Thus the activities of this material world begin. The activities of\nthe different species of living beings are begun from the very moment of the\ncreation. It is not that all is evolved. The different species of life are\ncreated immediately along with the universe. Men, animals, beasts,\nbirds\u2014everything is simultaneously created, because whatever desires the living\nentities had at the last annihilation are again manifested. It is clearly stated\nhere that the living entities have nothing to do with this process. The state of\nbeing in their past life in the past creation is simply manifested again, and\nall this is done simply by His will. This is the inconceivable potency of the\nSupreme Personality of God. And after creating different species of life, He has\nno connection with them. The creation takes place to accommodate the\ninclinations of the various living entities, and so the Lord does not become\ninvolved with it.",

The Supreme Lord\nis the supreme will and the background of this material manifestation, but the\nmanagement is being conducted by material nature.

All these\nliving entities, although born under the glance of the Supreme Lord, still take\ntheir different bodies according to their past deeds and desires. So the Lord is\nnot directly attached to this material creation. He simply glances over material\nnature; material nature is thus activated, and everything is created\nimmediately. Because He glances over material nature, there is undoubtedly\nactivity on the part of the Supreme Lord, but He has nothing to do with the\nmanifestation of the material world directly. This example is given in the\nsm\u1e5bti: when there is a fragrant flower before someone, the fragrance is touched\nby the smelling power of the person, yet the smelling and the flower are\ndetached from one another. There is a similar connection between the material\nworld and the Supreme Personality of Godhead; actually He has nothing to do with\nthis material world, but He creates by His glance and ordains. In summary,\nmaterial nature, without the superintendence of the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead, cannot do anything. Yet the Supreme Personality is detached from all\nmaterial activities.",

TRANSLATION  Fools deride Me when I descend in the human form. They do not know My\ntranscendental nature and My supreme dominion over all that be.  PURPORT  From the other explanations of the previous verses in this chapter, it is clear\nthat the Supreme Personality of Godhead, although appearing like a human being,\nis not a common man. The Personality of Godhead, who conducts the creation,\nmaintenance and annihilation of the complete cosmic manifestation, cannot be a\nhuman being. Yet there are many foolish men who consider K\u1e5b,s\u1e47a to be merely a\npowerful man and nothing more. Actually, He is the original Supreme Personality,\nas is confirmed in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (i\u015bvara\u1e25 parama\u1e25 k\u1e5bs\u1e47a\u1e25); He is the\nSupreme Lord.  There are many \u012b\u015bvaras, controllers, and one appears greater than another. In\nthe ordinary management of affairs in the material world, we find some official\nor director, and above him there is a secretary, and above him a minister, and\nabove him a president. Each of them is a controller, but one is controlled by\nanother. In the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 it is said that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the supreme controller;\nthere are many controllers undoubtedly both in the material and spiritual world,\nbut K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the supreme controller (\u012b\u015bvara\u1e25 parama\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u1e25), and His body is\nsac-cid-\u0101nanda, non-material.  Material bodies cannot perform the wonderful acts described in previous verses.\nHis body is eternal, blissful and full of knowledge. Although He is not a common\nman, the foolish deride Him and consider Him to be a man. His body is called\nhere m\u0101nu\u1e63\u012bm because He is acting just like a man, a friend of Arjuna\u2019s, a\npolitician involved in the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra. In so many ways He is acting\njust like an ordinary man, but actually His body is\nsac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha\u2014eternal bliss and knowledge absolute. This is confirmed\nin the Vedic language also (sac-cid-\u0101nanda-r\u016bp\u0101ya k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47\u0101ya): \u201cI offer my\nobeisances unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who is the eternal\nblissful form of knowledge.\u201d There are other descriptions in the Vedic language\nalso. Tam eka\u1e41 govindam: \u201cYou are Govinda, the pleasure of the senses and the\ncows.\u201d Sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraham: \u201cAnd Your form is transcendental, full of\nknowledge, bliss and eternality.\u201d  Despite the transcendental qualities of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s body, its full bliss and\nknowledge, there are many so-called scholars and commentators of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101\nwho deride K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as an ordinary man. The scholar may be born an extraordinary\nman due to his previous good work, but this conception of \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is due to a\npoor fund of knowledge. Therefore he is called m\u016b\u1e0dha, for only foolish persons\nconsider K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to be an ordinary human being because they do not know the\nconfidential activities of the Supreme Lord and His different energies. They do\nnot know that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s body is a symbol of complete knowledge and bliss, that He\nis the proprietor of everything that be and that He can award liberation to\nanyone. Because they do not know that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has so many transcendental\nqualifications, they deride Him.  Nor do they know that the appearance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in\nthis material world is a manifestation of His internal energy. He is the master\nof the material energy. As has been explained in several places (mama m\u0101y\u0101\nduratyay\u0101), He claims that the material energy, although very powerful, is under\nHis control, and whoever surrenders unto Him can get out of the control of this\nmaterial energy. If a soul surrendered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can get out of the influence of\nmaterial energy, then how can the Supreme Lord, who conducts the creation,\nmaintenance and annihilation of the whole cosmic nature, have a material body\nlike us? So this conception of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is complete foolishness. Foolish persons,\nhowever, cannot conceive that the Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, appearing just\nlike an ordinary man, can be the controller of all the atoms and of the gigantic\nmanifestation of the universal form. The biggest and the minutest are beyond\ntheir conception, so they cannot imagine that a form like that of a human being\ncan simultaneously control the infinite and the minute. Actually although He is\ncontrolling the infinite and the finite, He is apart from all this\nmanifestation. It is clearly stated concerning His yogam ai\u015bvaram, His\ninconceivable transcendental energy, that He can control the infinite and the\nfinite simultaneously and that He can remain aloof from them. Although the\nfoolish cannot imagine how K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who appears just like a human being, can\ncontrol the infinite and the finite, those who are pure devotees accept this,\nfor they know that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore they\ncompletely surrender unto Him and engage in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, devotional\nservice of the Lord.  There are many controversies amongst the impersonalists and the personalists\nabout the Lord\u2019s appearance as a human being. But if we consult Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101\nand \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, the authoritative texts for understanding the science of\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, then we can understand that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\nHe is not an ordinary man, although He appeared on this earth as an ordinary\nhuman. In the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, First Canto, First Chapter, when the sages\ninquire about the activities of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, it is stated that His appearance as a man\nbewilders the foolish. No human being could perform the wonderful acts that\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a performed while He was present on this earth. When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a appeared before\nHis father and mother, Vasudeva and Devak\u012b, He appeared with four hands, but\nafter the prayers of the parents, He transformed Himself into an ordinary child.\nHis appearance as an ordinary human being is one of the features of His\ntranscendental body. In the Eleventh Chapter of the G\u012bt\u0101 also it is stated,\ntenaiva r\u016bpe\u1e47a etc. Arjuna prayed to see again that form of four hands, and when\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was thus petitioned by Arjuna, He again assumed His original form. All\nthese different features of the Supreme Lord are certainly not those of an\nordinary human being.  Some of those who deride K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who are infected with the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophy,\nquote the following verse from the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam to prove that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is just\nan ordinary man: aha\u1e41 sarve\u1e63u bh\u016bte\u1e63u bh\u016bt\u0101tm\u0101vasthita\u1e25 sad\u0101: \u201cThe Supreme is\npresent in every living entity.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 3.29.21) We should better take note of\nthis particular verse from the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava \u0101c\u0101ryas like J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b instead of\nfollowing the interpretation of unauthorized persons who deride K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. J\u012bva\nGosv\u0101m\u012b, commenting on this verse, says that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, in His plenary expansion as\nParam\u0101tm\u0101, is situated in the moving and the nonmoving entities as the\nSupersoul, so any neophyte devotee who simply gives his attention to the\narca-m\u016brti, the form of the Supreme Lord in the temple, and does not respect\nother living entities is uselessly worshiping the form of the Lord in the\ntemple. There are three kinds of devotees of the Lord, and the neophyte is in\nthe lowest stage. The neophyte devotee gives more attention to the Deity in the\ntemple than to other devotees, so J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b warns that this sort of mentality\nshould be corrected. A devotee should see that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is present in everyone\u2019s\nheart as Param\u0101tm\u0101; therefore every body is the embodiment or the temple of the\nSupreme Lord, and as such, as one offers respect to the temple of the Lord, he\nshould similarly properly respect each and every body in whom the Param\u0101tm\u0101\ndwells. Everyone should therefore be given proper respect and should not be\nneglected.  There are also many impersonalists who deride temple worship. They say that\nsince God is everywhere, why should one restrict himself to temple worship? But\nif God is everywhere, is He not in the temple or in the Deity? Although the\npersonalist and the impersonalist will fight with one another perpetually, a\nperfect devotee in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness knows that although K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme\nPersonality, He is all-pervading, as is confirmed in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101.\nAlthough His personal abode is Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana and He is always staying there,\nstill, by His different manifestations of energy and by His plenary expansion,\nHe is present everywhere in all parts of the material and spiritual creation.",

TRANSLATION  Those who are thus bewildered are attracted by demonic and atheistic views. In\nthat deluded condition, their hopes for liberation, their fruitive activities,\nand their culture of knowledge are all defeated.  PURPORT  There are many devotees who assume themselves to be in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and\ndevotional service but at heart do not accept the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, as the Absolute Truth. For them, the fruit of devotional\nservice\u2014going back to Godhead\u2014will never be tasted. Similarly, those who are\nengaged in fruitive, pious activities and who are ultimately hoping to be\nliberated from this material entanglement will never be successful either\nbecause they deride the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In other words,\npersons who mock K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are to be understood to be demonic or atheistic. As\ndescribed in the Seventh Chapter of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, such demonic miscreants never\nsurrender to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore their mental speculations to arrive at the\nAbsolute Truth bring them to the false conclusion that the ordinary living\nentity and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are one and the same. With such a false conviction, they think\nthat the body of any human being is now simply covered by material nature and\nthat as soon as one is liberated from this material body there is no difference\nbetween God and himself. This attempt to become one with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a will be baffled\nbecause of delusion. Such atheistic and demoniac cultivation of spiritual\nknowledge is always futile. That is the indication of this verse. For such\npersons, cultivation of the knowledge in the Vedic literature, like the\nVed\u0101nta-s\u016btra and the Upani\u1e63ads, is always baffled.  It is a great offense, therefore, to consider K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead, to be an ordinary man. Those who do so are certainly deluded because\nthey cannot understand the eternal form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In the B\u1e5bhad-vai\u1e63\u1e47ava mantra\nit is clearly stated that one who considers the body of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to be material\nshould be driven out from all rituals and activities of the \u015bruti. And if one by\nchance sees his face, he should at once take bath in the Ganges to rid himself\nof infection. People jeer at K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a because they are envious of the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead. Their destiny is certainly to take birth after birth in\nthe species of atheistic and demoniac life. Perpetually, their real knowledge\nwill remain under delusion, and gradually they will regress to the darkest\nregion of creation.",

They are fully engaged in devotional service\nbecause they know Me as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, original and\ninexhaustible.  PURPORT  In this verse the description of mah\u0101tm\u0101 is clearly given. The first sign of the\nmah\u0101tm\u0101 is that he is already situated in the divine nature. He is not under the\ncontrol of material nature. And how is this effected? That is explained in the\nSeventh Chapter: one who surrenders unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, \u015ar\u012b\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, at once becomes freed from the control of material nature. That is the\nqualification. One can become free from the control of material nature as soon\nas he surrenders his soul to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That is the\npreliminary formula. Being marginal potency, as soon as the living entity is\nfreed from the control of material nature, he is put under the guidance of the\nspiritual nature. The guidance of the spiritual nature is called daiv\u012b\u1e41\nprak\u1e5btim, divine nature. So, when one is promoted in that way\u2014by surrendering to\nthe Supreme Personality of Godhead\u2014one attains to the stage of great soul,\nmah\u0101tm\u0101.  The mah\u0101tm\u0101 does not divert his attention to anything outside K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a because he\nknows perfectly well that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the original Supreme Person, the cause of all\ncauses. There is no doubt about it. Such a mah\u0101tm\u0101, or great soul, develops\nthrough association with other mah\u0101tm\u0101s, pure devotees. Pure devotees are not\neven attracted by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s other features, such as the four-armed Mah\u0101-Vi\u1e63\u1e47u.\nThey are simply attracted by the two-armed form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Since they are not\nattracted to other features of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (what to speak of the demigods), they are\nnot concerned with any form of a demigod or of a human being. They only meditate\nupon K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. They are always engaged in the unswerving\nservice of the Lord in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.",

PURPORT  The mah\u0101tm\u0101 cannot be manufactured by rubber-stamping an ordinary man. His\nsymptoms are described here: a mah\u0101tm\u0101 is always engaged in chanting the glories\nof the Supreme Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Personality of Godhead. He has no other business.\nHe is always engaged in the glorification of the Lord. In other words, he is not\nan impersonalist. When the question of glorification is there, one has to\nglorify the Supreme Lord, praising His holy name, His eternal form, His\ntranscendental qualities and His uncommon pastimes. One has to glorify all these\nthings; therefore a mah\u0101tm\u0101 is attached to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.  One who is attached to the impersonal feature of the Supreme Lord, the\nbrahmajyoti, is not described as mah\u0101tm\u0101 in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. He is described\nin a different way in the next verse. The mah\u0101tm\u0101 is always engaged in different\nactivities of devotional service, as described in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, hearing\nand chanting about Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, not a demigod or human being. That is devotion:\n\u015brava\u1e47a\u1e41 k\u012brtana\u1e41 vi\u1e63\u1e47o\u1e25, smara\u1e47am, and remembering Him. Such a mah\u0101tm\u0101 has firm\ndetermination to achieve at the ultimate end the association of the Supreme Lord\nin any one of the five transcendental rasas. To achieve that success, he engages\nall activities\u2014mental, bodily and vocal, everything\u2014in the service of the\nSupreme Lord, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. That is called full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.  In devotional service there are certain activities which are called determined,\nsuch as fasting on certain days, like the eleventh day of the moon, Ek\u0101da\u015b\u012b, and\non the appearance day of the Lord, etc. All these rules and regulations are\noffered by the great \u0101c\u0101ryas for those who are actually interested in getting\nadmission into the association of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in the\ntranscendental world. The mah\u0101tm\u0101s, great souls, strictly observe all these\nrules and regulations, and therefore they are sure to achieve the desired\nresult.  As described in the second verse of this chapter, this devotional service is not\nonly easy, but it can be performed in a happy mood. One does not need to undergo\nany severe penance and austerity. He can live this life in devotional service,\nguided by an expert spiritual master, and in any position, either as a\nhouseholder or a sanny\u0101s\u012b, or a brahmac\u0101r\u012b; in any position and anywhere in the\nworld, he can perform this devotional service to the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead and thus become actually mah\u0101tm\u0101, a great soul.",

Some of them\nare already described as the distressed, the financially destitute, the\ninquisitive, and those who are engaged in the cultivation of knowledge. But\nthere are others who are still lower, and these are divided into three: 1) He\nwho worships himself as one with the Supreme Lord, 2) He who concocts some form\nof the Supreme Lord and worships that, and 3) He who accepts the universal form,\nthe vi\u015bvar\u016bpa of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and worships that. Out of\nthe above three, the lowest, those who worship themselves as the Supreme Lord,\nthinking themselves to be monists, are most predominant. Such people think\nthemselves to be the Supreme Lord, and in this mentality they worship\nthemselves. This is also a type of God worship, for they can understand that\nthey are not the material body but are actually spiritual soul; at least, such a\nsense is prominent. Generally the impersonalists worship the Supreme Lord in\nthis way. The second class includes the worshipers of the demigods, those who by\nimagination consider any form to be the form of the Supreme Lord. And the third\nclass includes those who cannot conceive of anything beyond the manifestation of\nthis material universe. They consider the universe to be the supreme organism or\nentity and worship that. The universe is also a form of the Lord.",

TRANSLATION  But it is I who am the ritual, I the sacrifice, the offering to the ancestors,\nthe healing herb, the transcendental chant. I am the butter and the fire and the\noffering.  PURPORT  The sacrifice known as jyoti\u1e63\u1e6doma is also K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and He is also the mah\u0101-yaj\u00f1a\nThe oblations offered to the Pit\u1e5bloka or the sacrifice performed to please the\nPit\u1e5bloka, considered as a kind of drug in the form of clarified butter, is also\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The mantras chanted in this connection are also K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. And many other\ncommodities made with milk products for offering in the sacrifices are also\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The fire is also K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a because fire is one of the five material elements\nand is therefore claimed as the separated energy of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In other words, the\nVedic sacrifices recommended in the karma-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da division of the Vedas are in\ntotal also K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Or, in other words, those who are engaged in rendering\ndevotional service unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are to be understood to have performed all the\nsacrifices recommended in the Vedas.",

I am also the \u1e5ak,\nthe S\u0101ma, and the Yajur [Vedas].  PURPORT  The entire cosmic manifestations, moving and nonmoving, are manifested by\ndifferent activities of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s energy. In the material existence we create\ndifferent relationships with different living entities who are nothing but\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s marginal energy, but under the creation of prak\u1e5bti some of them appear\nas our father, mother, grandfather, creator, etc., but actually they are parts\nand parcels of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. As such, these living entities who appear to be our\nfather, mother, etc., are nothing but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In this verse the word dh\u0101t\u0101 means\ncreator. Not only are our father and mother parts and parcels of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but\ntheir creator, grandmother, and grandfather, etc., are also K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Actually any\nliving entity, being part and parcel of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. All the Vedas,\ntherefore, aim only toward K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Whatever we want to know through the Vedas is\nbut a progressive step to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. That subject matter which helps us\npurify our constitutional position is especially K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Similarly, the living\nentity who is inquisitive to understand all Vedic principles is also part and\nparcel of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and as such is also K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In all the Vedic mantras the word om,\ncalled pra\u1e47ava, is a transcendental sound vibration and is also K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. And\nbecause in all the hymns of the four Vedas, S\u0101ma, Yajur, \u1e5ag and Atharva, the\npra\u1e47ava or omk\u0101ra is very prominent, it is understood to be K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",

TRANSLATION  I am the goal, the sustainer, the master, the witness, the abode, the refuge and\nthe most dear friend. I am the creation and the annihilation, the basis of\neverything, the resting place and the eternal seed.  PURPORT  Gati means the destination where we want to go. But the ultimate goal is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a,\nalthough people do not know it. One who does not know K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is misled, and his\nso-called progressive march is either partial or hallucinatory. There are many\nwho make as their destination different demigods, and by rigid performance of\nthe strict respective methods they reach different planets known as Candraloka,\nS\u016bryaloka, Indraloka, Maharloka, etc. But all such lokas or planets, being\ncreations of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, are simultaneously K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and not K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Actually such\nplanets, being the manifestations of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s energy, are also K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but\nactually they only serve as a step forward for realization of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. To approach\nthe different energies of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is to approach K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a indirectly. One should\ndirectly approach K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, for that will save time and energy. For example, if\nthere is a possibility of going to the top of a building by the help of an\nelevator, why should one go by the staircase, step by step? Everything is\nresting on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s energy; therefore without K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s shelter nothing can exist.\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the supreme ruler because everything belongs to Him and everything\nexists on His energy. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, being situated in everyone\u2019s heart, is the supreme\nwitness. The residences, countries or planets on which we live are also K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the ultimate goal of shelter, and as such one should take shelter of\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a either for protection or for annihilation of his distressed condition. And\nwhenever we have to take protection, we should know that our protection must be\na living force. Thus K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the supreme living entity. Since K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the\nsource of our generation, or the supreme father, no one can be a better friend\nthan K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, nor can anyone be a better well-wisher. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the original source\nof creation and the ultimate rest after annihilation. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is therefore the\neternal cause of all causes.",

PURPORT  K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, by His different energies, diffuses heat and light through the agency of\nelectricity and the sun. During summer season it is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a who checks rain from\nfalling from the sky, and then, during the rainy season, He gives unceasing\ntorrents of rain. The energy which sustains us by prolonging the duration of our\nlife is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a meets us at the end as death. By analyzing all these\ndifferent energies of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one can acertain that for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a there is no\ndistinction between matter and spirit, or, in other words, He is both matter and\nspirit. In the advanced stage of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, one does not therefore\nmake such distinctions. He sees K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a only in everything.  Since K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is both matter and spirit, the gigantic universal form comprising\nall material manifestations is also K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and His pastimes in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana as\ntwo-handed \u015ay\u0101masundara, playing on a flute, are those of the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead.",

TRANSLATION  Those who study the Vedas and drink the soma juice, seeking the heavenly\nplanets, worship Me indirectly. They take birth on the planet of Indra, where\nthey enjoy godly delights.  PURPORT  The word trai-vidy\u0101\u1e25 refers to the three Vedas, S\u0101ma, Yajur and \u1e5ag. A br\u0101hma\u1e47a\nwho has studied these three Vedas is called a tri-ved\u012b. Anyone who is very much\nattached to knowledge derived from these three Vedas is respected in society.\nUnfortunately, there are many great scholars of the Vedas who do not know the\nultimate purport of studying them. Therefore K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a herein declares Himself to be\nthe ultimate goal for the tri-ved\u012bs. Actual tri-ved\u012bs take shelter under the\nlotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and engage in pure devotional service to satisfy the Lord.\nDevotional service begins with the chanting of the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra and side by\nside trying to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in truth. Unfortunately those who are simply\nofficial students of the Vedas become more interested in offering sacrifices to\nthe different demigods like Indra, Candra, etc. By such endeavor, the worshipers\nof different demigods are certainly purified of the contamination of the lower\nqualities of nature and are thereby elevated to the higher planetary system or\nheavenly planets known as Maharloka, Janaloka, Tapoloka, etc. Once situated on\nthose higher planetary systems, one can satisfy his senses hundreds of thousands\nof times better than on this planet.

Similarly, everyone is to offer his worship to the Supreme Lord only.\nThat will automatically satisfy the different officers and directors of the\nLord. The officers and directors are engaged as representatives of the\ngovernment, and to offer some bribe to the officers and directors is illegal.\nThis is stated here as avidhi-p\u016brvakam. In other words, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a does not approve\nthe unnecessary worship of the demigods.",

Yaj\u00f1a means Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. In the Second Chapter of\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 it is clearly stated that one should only work for satisfying\nYaj\u00f1a or Vi\u1e63\u1e47u.

PURPORT  If anyone has any desire to go to the moon, the sun, or any other planet, one\ncan attain the desired destination by following specific Vedic principles\nrecommended for that purpose. These are vividly described in the fruitive\nactivities portion of the Vedas, technically known as dar\u015ba-paur\u1e47am\u0101s\u012b, which\nrecommends a specific worship of demigods situated on different heavenly\nplanets. Similarly, one can attain the pit\u0101 planets by performing a specific\nyaj\u00f1a. Similarly, one can go to many ghostly planets and become a yak\u1e63a, rak\u1e63a\nor pi\u015b\u0101ca. Pi\u015b\u0101ca worship is called \u201cblack arts\u201d or \u201cblack magic.\u201d There are\nmany men who practice this black art, and they think that it is spiritualism,\nbut such activities are completely materialistic. Similarly, a pure devotee, who\nworships the Supreme Personality of Godhead only, achieves the planets of\nVaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aloka without a doubt. It is very easy to understand through\nthis important verse that if by simply worshiping the demigods one can achieve\nthe heavenly planets, or by worshiping the pit\u0101 achieve the pit\u0101 planets, or by\npracticing the black arts achieve the ghostly planets, why can the pure devotee\nnot achieve the planet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or Vi\u1e63\u1e47u? Unfortunately many people have no\ninformation of these sublime planets where K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Vi\u1e63\u1e47u live, and because\nthey do not know of them they fall down. Even the impersonalists fall down from\nthe brahmajyoti. This K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is therefore distributing\nsublime information to the entire human society to the effect that by simply\nchanting the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra one can become perfect in this life and go back\nhome, back to Godhead.",

TRANSLATION  If one offers Me with love and devotion a leaf, a flower, fruit a water, I will\naccept it.  PURPORT  Here Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, having established that He is the only enjoyer, the primeval\nLord, and the real object of all sacrificial offerings, reveals what types of\nsacrifices He desires to be offered. If one wishes to engage in devotional\nservice to the Supreme in order to be purified and to reach the goal of life\u2014the\ntranscendental loving service of God\u2014then he should find out what the Lord\ndesires of him. One who loves K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a will give Him whatever He wants, and he\navoids offering anything which is undesirable or unasked for. Thus, meat, fish\nand eggs should not be offered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. If He desired such things as offerings,\nHe would have said so. Instead He clearly requests that a leaf, fruit, flowers\nand water be given to Him, and He says of this offering, \u201cI will accept it.\u201d\nTherefore, we should understand that He will not accept meat, fish and eggs.\nVegetables, grains, fruits, milk and water are the proper foods for human beings\nand are prescribed by Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself. Whatever else we eat cannot be offered\nto Him, since He will not accept it. Thus we cannot be acting on the level of\nloving devotion if we offer such foods.  In the Third Chapter, verse thirteen, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a explains that only the remains\nof sacrifice are purified and fit for consumption by those who are seeking\nadvancement in life and release from the clutches of the material entanglement.\nThose who do not make an offering of their food, He says in the same verse, are\nsaid to be eating only sin. In other words, their every mouthful is simply\ndeepening their involvement in the complexities of material nature. But\npreparing nice, simple vegetable dishes, offering them before the picture or\nDeity of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and bowing down and praying for Him to accept such a humble\noffering, enable one to advance steadily in life, to purify the body, and to\ncreate fine brain tissues which will lead to clear thinking. Above all, the\noffering should be made with an attitude of love. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has no need of food,\nsince He already possesses everything that be, yet He will accept the offering\nof one who desires to please Him in that way. The important element, in\npreparation, in serving and in offering, is to act with love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.  The impersonalist philosophers, who wish to maintain that the Absolute Truth is\nwithout senses, cannot comprehend this verse of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. To them, it is\neither a metaphor or proof of the mundane character of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the speaker of the\nG\u012bt\u0101. But, in actuality, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Godhead, has senses, and it is\nstated that His senses are interchangeable; in other words, one sense can\nperform the function of any other. This is what it means to say that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is\nabsolute. Lacking senses, He could hardly be considered full in all opulences.\nIn the Seventh Chapter, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has explained that He impregnates the living\nentities into material nature. This is done by His looking upon material nature.\nAnd so in this instance, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s hearing the devotee\u2019s words of love in offering\nfoodstuffs is wholly identical with His eating and actually tasting. This point\nshould be emphasized: because of His absolute position, His hearing is wholly\nidentical with His eating and tasting. Only the devotee, who accepts K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as He\ndescribes Himself, without interpretation, can understand that the Supreme\nAbsolute Truth can eat food and enjoy it.",

Everyone has to work for maintenance of his\nbody and soul together, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a recommends herein that one should work for\nHim. Everyone has to eat something to live; therefore he should accept the\nremnants of foodstuffs offered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Any civilized man has to perform some\nreligious ritualistic ceremonies; therefore K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a recommends, \u201cDo it for Me,\u201d\nand this is called arcan\u0101. Everyone has a tendency to give something in charity;\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says, \u201cGive it to Me,\u201d and this means that all surplus money accummulated\nshould be utilized in furthering the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement. Nowadays\npeople are very much inclined to the meditational process, which is not\npractical in this age, but if anyone practices meditating on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a twenty-four\nhours by chanting the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra round his beads, he is surely the\ngreatest yog\u012b, as substantiated by the Sixth Chapter of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.",

TRANSLATION  In this way you will be freed from all reactions to good and evil deeds, and by\nthis principle of renunciation you will be liberated and come to Me.  PURPORT  One who acts in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness under superior direction is called yukta.\nThe technical term is yukta-vair\u0101gya. This is further explained by R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b\nas follows.  R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b says that as long as we are in this material world we have to act;\nwe cannot cease acting. Therefore if actions are performed and the fruits are\ngiven to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, then that is called yukta-vair\u0101gya. Actually situated in\nrenunciation, such activities clear the mirror of the mind, and as the actor\ngradually makes progress in spiritual realization he becomes completely\nsurrendered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore at the end he\nbecomes liberated, and this liberation is also specified. By this liberation he\ndoes not become one with the brahmajyoti but rather enters into the planet of\nthe Supreme Lord. It is clearly mentioned here: m\u0101m upai\u1e63yasi, \u201che comes to Me,\u201d\nback home, back to Godhead. There are five different stages of liberation, and\nhere it is specified that the devotee who has always lived his lifetime here\nunder the direction of the Supreme Lord, as stated, has evolved to the point\nwhere he can, after quitting this body, go back to Godhead and engage directly\nin the association of the Supreme Lord.  Anyone who has no other interest but to dedicate his life to the service of the\nLord is actually a sanny\u0101s\u012b Such a person always thinks of himself as an eternal\nservant, dependant on the supreme will of the Lord. As such, whatever he does,\nhe does it for the benefit of the Lord. Whatever action he performs, he performs\nit as service to the Lord. He does not give serious attention to the fruitive\nactivities or prescribed duties mentioned in the Vedas. For ordinary persons it\nis obligatory to execute the prescribed duties mentioned in the Vedas, but\nalthough a pure devotee who is completely engaged in the service of the Lord may\nsometimes appear to go against the prescribed Vedic duties, actually it is not\nso.  It is said, therefore, by Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava authorities that even the most intelligent\nperson cannot understand the plans and activities of a pure devotee. The exact\nwords are vai\u1e63\u1e47avera kriy\u0101 mudr\u0101 vij\u00f1e n\u0101 bujhay\u0101. A person who is thus always\nengaged in the service of the Lord or is always thinking and planning how to\nserve the Lord is to be considered completely liberated at present and in the\nfuture. His going home, back to Godhead, is guaranteed. He is above all\nmaterialistic criticism, just as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is above all criticism.",

TRANSLATION  I envy no one, nor am I partial to anyone. I am equal to all. But whoever\nrenders service unto Me in devotion is a friend, is in Me, and I am also a\nfriend to him.  PURPORT  One may question here that if K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is equal to everyone and no one is His\nspecial friend, then why does He take a special interest in the devotees who are\nalways engaged in His transcendental service? But this is not discrimination; it\nis natural. Any man in this material world may be very charitably disposed, yet\nhe has a special interest in his own children. The Lord claims that every living\nentity\u2014in whatever form\u2014is His son, and as such He provides everyone with a\ngenerous supply of the necessities of life. He is just like a cloud which pours\nrain all over, regardless whether it falls on rock or land or water. But for His\ndevotees, He gives specific attention. Such devotees are mentioned here: they\nare always in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, and therefore they are always\ntranscendentally situated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The very phrase K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness suggests\nthat those who are in such consciousness are living transcendentalists, situated\nin Him. The Lord says here distinctly, \u201cmayi te,\u201d \u201cin Me.\u201d Naturally, as a\nresult, the Lord is also in them. This is reciprocal. This also explains the\nwords: asti na priya\u1e25/ye bhajanti: \u201cWhoever surrenders unto Me, proportionately\nI take care of him.\u201d This transcendental reciprocation exists because both the\nLord and the devotee are conscious. When a diamond is set in a golden ring, it\nlooks very nice. The gold is glorified, and at the same time the diamond is\nglorified. The Lord and the living entity eternally glitter, and when a living\nentity becomes inclined to the service of the Supreme Lord, he looks like gold.\nThe Lord is a diamond, and so this combination is very nice. Living entities in\na pure state are called devotees. The Supreme Lord becomes the devotee of His\ndevotees. If a reciprocal relationship is not present between the devotee and\nthe Lord, then there is no personalist philosophy. In the impersonal philosophy\nthere is no reciprocation between the Supreme and the living entity, but in the\npersonalist philosophy there is.  The example is often given that the Lord is like a desire tree, and whatever one\nwants from this desire tree, the Lord supplies. But here the explanation is more\ncomplete. The Lord is here stated to be partial to the devotees. This is the\nmanifestation of the Lord\u2019s special mercy to the devotees. The Lord\u2019s\nreciprocation should not be considered to be under the law of karma. It belongs\nto the transcendental situation in which the Lord and His devotees function.\nDevotional service of the Lord is not an activity of this material world; it is\npart of the spiritual world where eternity, bliss and knowledge predominate.",

Besides these, the\nliving entity who is fully conscious of his spiritual nature and is engaged in\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, or the devotional service of the Lord, has activities which\nare called transcendental. Such activities are performed in his constitutional\nposition, and they are technically called devotional service. Now, in the\nconditioned state, sometimes devotional service and the conditional service in\nrelation to the body will parallel one another. But then again, sometimes these\nactivities become opposed to one another. As far as possible, a devotee is very\ncautious so that he does not do anything that could disrupt his wholesome\ncondition. He knows that perfection in his activities depends on his progressive\nrealization of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Sometimes, however, it may be seen that a\nperson in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness commits some act which may be taken as most\nabominable socially or politically. But such a temporary falldown does not\ndisqualify him. In the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam it is stated that if a person falls\ndown, but is wholeheartedly engaged in the transcendental service of the Supreme\nLord, the Lord, being situated within his heart, beautifies him and excuses him\nfrom that abomination. The material contamination is so strong that even a yog\u012b\nfully engaged in the service of the Lord sometimes becomes ensnared; but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness is so strong that such an occasional falldown is at once\nrectified. Therefore the process of devotional service is always a success. No\none should deride a devotee for some accidental falldown from the ideal path,\nfor, as is explained in the next verse, such occasional falldowns will be\nstopped in due course, as soon as a devotee is completely situated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness.  Therefore a person who is situated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and is engaged with\ndetermination in the process of chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a,\nHare Hare/Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare should be considered to be\nin the transcendental position, even if by chance or accident he is found to\nhave fallen. The words s\u0101dhur eva, \u201che is saintly,\u201d are very emphatic. They are\na warning to the nondevotees that because of an accidental falldown a devotee\nshould not be derided; he should still be considered saintly even if he has\nfallen down accidentally. And the word mantavya\u1e25 is still more emphatic. If one\ndoes not follow this rule, and derides a devotee for his accidental falldown,\nthen he is disobeying the order of the Supreme Lord. The only qualification of a\ndevotee is to be unflinchingly and exclusively engaged in devotional service.  The mark of a spot which may be seen on the moon does not become an impediment\nto the moonlight. Similarly, the accidental falldown of a devotee from the path\nof a saintly character does not make him abominable. On the other hand, one\nshould not misunderstand that a devotee in transcendental devotional service can\nact in all kinds of abominable ways; this verse only refers to an accident due\nto the strong power of material connections. Devotional service is more or less\na declaration of war against the illusory energy. As long as one is not strong\nenough to fight the illusory energy, there may be accidental falldowns. But when\none is strong enough, he is no longer subjected to such falldowns, as previously\nexplained. No one should take advantage of this verse and commit nonsense and\nthink that he is still a devotee. If he does not improve in his character by\ndevotional service, then it is to be understood that he is not a high devotee.",

TRANSLATION  He quickly becomes righteous and attains lasting peace. O son of Kunt\u012b, declare\nit boldly that My devotee never perishes.  PURPORT  This should not be misunderstood. In the Seventh Chapter the Lord says that one\nwho is engaged in mischievous activities cannot become a devotee of the Lord.\nOne who is not a devotee of the Lord has no good qualifications whatsoever. The\nquestion remains, then, how can a person engaged in abominable activities\u2014either\nby accident or intention\u2014be a pure devotee? This question may justly be raised.\nThe miscreants, as stated in the Seventh Chapter, who never come to the\ndevotional service of the Lord, have no good qualifications, as is stated in the\n\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. Generally, a devotee who is engaged in the nine kinds of\ndevotional activities is engaged in the process of cleansing all material\ncontamination from the heart. He puts the Supreme Personality of Godhead within\nhis heart, and all sinful contaminations are naturally washed away. Continuous\nthinking of the Supreme Lord makes him pure by nature. According to the Vedas,\nthere is a certain regulation that if one falls down from his exalted position,\nhe has to undergo certain ritualistic processes to purify himself. But here\nthere is no such condition because the purifying process is already there in the\nheart of the devotee, due to his remembering the Supreme Personality of Godhead\nconstantly. Therefore, the chanting of Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare\nHare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare should be continued without\nstoppage. This will protect a devotee from all accidental falldowns. He will\nthus remain perpetually free from all material contaminations.",

PURPORT  It is clearly declared here by the Supreme Lord that in devotional service there\nis no distinction between the lower or higher classes of people. In the material\nconception of life, there are such divisions, but for a person engaged in\ntranscendental devotional service to the Lord, there are not. Everyone is\neligible for the supreme destination.

The most simple man taking center\nof the pure devotee can be purified by proper guidance. According to the\ndifferent modes of material nature, men are classified in the mode of goodness\n(br\u0101hma\u1e47as), the mode of passion (k\u1e63atriyas, or administrators), the mixed modes\nof passion and ignorance (vai\u015byas, or merchants), and the mode of ignorance\n(\u015b\u016bdras, or workers). Those lower than them are called ca\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101las, and they are\nborn in sinful families. Generally, those who are born in sinful families are\nnot accepted by the higher classes. But the process of devotional service and\nthe pure devotee of the Supreme God are so strong that all the lower classes can\nattain the highest perfection of life. This is possible only when one takes\ncenter of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. One has to take center completely of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.

Unfortunately, unscrupulous commentators divert\nthe mind of the reader to that which is not at all feasible. Such commentators\ndo not know that there is no difference between K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s mind and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is\nnot an ordinary human being; He is Absolute Truth. His body, mind and He Himself\nare one and absolute. It is stated in the K\u016brma Pur\u0101\u1e47a, as it is quoted by\nBhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b Gosv\u0101m\u012b in his Anubh\u0101\u1e63ya comments on\nCaitanya-carit\u0101mrta, Fifth Chapter, \u0100di-l\u012bl\u0101, verses 41\u201348, \u201cdeha-dehi-vibhedo\n\u2019ya\u1e41 ne\u015bvare vidyate kvacit,\u201d which means that there is no difference in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a,\nthe Supreme Lord, between Himself and His body. But, because they do not know\nthis science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the commentators hide K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and divide His personality\nfrom His mind or from His body. Although this is sheer ignorance of the science\nof K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, some men make profit out of misleading the people.  There are some who are demonic; they also think of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but enviously, just\nlike King Ka\u1e41sa, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s uncle. He was also thinking of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a always, but he\nthought of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as his enemy. He was always in anxiety, wondering when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nwould come to kill him. That kind of thinking will not help us. One should be\nthinking of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in devotional love. That is bhakti. One should cultivate the\nknowledge of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a continually. What is that favorable cultivation? It is to\nlearn from a bona fide teacher. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and\nwe have several times explained that His body is not material, but is eternal,\nblissful knowledge. This kind of talk about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a will help one become a\ndevotee. Otherwise, understanding K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a from the wrong source will prove\nfruitless.  One should therefore engage his mind in the eternal form, the primal form of\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; with conviction in his heart that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme, he should engage\nhimself in worship. There are hundreds of thousands of temples in India for the\nworship of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and devotional service is practiced there. When such practice\nis made, one has to offer obeisances to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. One should lower his head before\nthe Deity and engage his mind, his body, his activities\u2014everything. That will\nmake one fully absorbed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a without deviation. This will help one transfer\ninto the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aloka. One should not be deviated by unscrupulous commentators. One\nmust engage in the nine different processes of devotional service, beginning\nwith hearing and chanting about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Pure devotional service is the highest\nachievement of human society.  In the Seventh and Eighth Chapters of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, pure devotional service to\nthe Lord has been explained, apart from the yoga of knowledge and mystic yoga or\nfruitive activities. Those who are not purely sanctified may be attracted by\ndifferent features of the Lord, like the impersonal brahmajyoti and localized\nParam\u0101tm\u0101, but a pure devotee directly takes to the service of the Supreme Lord.  There is a beautiful poem about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in which it is clearly stated that any\nperson who is engaged in the worship of demigods is most unintelligent and\ncannot achieve at any time the supreme award of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The devotee, in the\nbeginning, may sometimes fall from the standard, but still he should be\nconsidered superior to all other philosophers and yog\u012bs. One who always engages\nin K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness should be understood to be the perfect saintly person.\nHis accidental nondevotional activities will diminish, and he will soon be\nsituated without any doubt in complete perfection. The pure devotee has no\nactual chance to fall down because the Supreme Godhead personally takes care of\nHis pure devotees. Therefore, the intelligent person should take directly to\nthis process of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and happily live in this material world. He\nwill eventually receive the supreme award of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",

While K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was\npresent on this earth, He displayed all six opulences. Therefore great sages\nlike Par\u0101\u015bara Muni have all accepted K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead. Now K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is instructing Arjuna in more confidential knowledge of His\nopulences and His work. Previously, beginning with the Seventh Chapter, the Lord\nalready explained His different energies and how they are acting. Now in this\nchapter He explains His specific opulences to Arjuna. In the previous chapter he\nhas clearly explained His different energies to establish devotion in firm\nconviction. Again in this chapter He tells Arjuna about His manifestations and\nvarious opulences.\n\n\nThe more one hears about the Supreme God, the more one becomes fixed in\ndevotional service. One should always hear about the Lord in the association of\ndevotees; that will enhance one\u2019s devotional service. Discourses in the society\nof devotees can take place only among those who are really anxious to be in\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Others cannot take part in such discourses.

No one is\ngreater than Him; He is the cause of all causes. Here it is also stated by the\nLord personally that He is the cause of all the demigods and sages. Even the\ndemigods and great sages cannot understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; they can understand neither\nHis name nor His personality, so what is the position of the so-called scholars\nof this tiny planet? No one can understand why this Supreme God comes to earth\nas an ordinary human being and executes such commonplace and yet wonderful\nactivities. One should know, then, that scholarship is not the qualification\nnecessary to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Even the demigods and the great sages have tried\nto understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by their mental speculation, and they have failed to do so.\nIn the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam also it is clearly said that even the great demigods\nare not able to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. They can\nspeculate to the limits of their imperfect senses and can reach the opposite\nconclusion of impersonalism, of something not manifested by the three qualities\nof material nature, or they can imagine something by mental speculation, but it\nis not possible to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by such foolish speculation.\n\n\nHere the Lord indirectly says that if anyone wants to know the Absolute Truth,\n\u201cHere I am present as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. I am the Supreme.\u201d One\nshould know this. Although one cannot understand the inconceivable Lord who is\npersonally present, He nonetheless exists. We can actually understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who\nis eternal, full of bliss and knowledge, simply by studying His words in\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. The impersonal Brahman can be conceived by\npersons who are already in the inferior energy of the Lord, but the Personality\nof Godhead cannot be conceived unless one is in the transcendental position.\n\n\nBecause most men cannot understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in His actual situation, out of His\ncauseless mercy He descends to show favor to such speculators. Yet despite the\nSupreme Lord\u2019s uncommon activities, these speculators, due to contamination in\nthe material energy, still think that the impersonal Brahman is the Supreme.\nOnly the devotees who are fully surrendered unto the Supreme Lord can\nunderstand, by the grace of the Supreme Personality, that He is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The\ndevotees of the Lord do not bother about the impersonal Brahman conception of\nGod; their faith and devotion bring them to surrender immediately unto the\nSupreme Lord, and out of the causeless mercy of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, they can understand\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. No one else can understand Him. So even great sages agree: What is \u0101tm\u0101,\nwhat is the Supreme? It is He whom we have to worship.\n\n\n10.3\n\n\nyo m\u0101m ajam an\u0101di\u1e41 ca\n\n\nvetti loka-mahe\u015bvaram\n\n\nasamm\u016b\u1e0dha\u1e25 sa martye\u1e63u\n\n\nsarva-p\u0101pai\u1e25 pramucyate\n\n\nya\u1e25\u2014anyone; m\u0101m\u2014unto Me; ajam\u2014unborn; an\u0101dim\u2014without beginning; ca\u2014also;\nvetti\u2014knows; loka\u2014the planets; mahe\u015bvaram\u2014supreme master; asa\u1e41m\u016b\u1e0dha\u1e25\u2014without\ndoubt; sa\u1e25\u2014he; martye\u1e63u\u2014among those subject to death; sarva-p\u0101pai\u1e25\u2014from all\nsinful reactions; pramucyate\u2014is delivered.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nHe who knows Me as the unborn, as the beginningless, as the Supreme Lord of all\nthe worlds\u2014he, undeluded among men, is freed from all sins.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nAs stated in the Seventh Chapter, those who are trying to elevate themselves to\nthe platform of spiritual realization are not ordinary men. They are superior to\nmillions and millions of ordinary men who have no knowledge of spiritual\nrealization, but out of those actually trying to understand their spiritual\nsituation, one who can come to the understanding that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead, the proprietor of everything, the unborn, is the most\nsuccessful spiritually realized person. In that stage only, when one has fully\nunderstood K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s supreme position, can one be free completely from all sinful\nreactions.\n\n\nHere the word ajam, meaning unborn, should not be confused with the living\nentities, who are described in the Second Chapter as ajam. The Lord is different\nfrom the living entities who are taking birth and dying due to material\nattachment. The conditional souls are changing their bodies, but His body is not\nchangeable. Even when He comes to this material world, He comes as the same\nunborn; therefore in the Fourth Chapter it is said that the Lord, by His\ninternal potency, is not under the inferior material energy, but is always in\nthe superior energy.\n\n\nHe was existing before the creation, and He is different from His creation. All\nthe demigods were created within this material world, but as far as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is\nconcerned, it is said that He is not created; therefore K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is different even\nfrom the great demigods like Brahm\u0101 and \u015aiva. And because He is the creator of\nBrahm\u0101, \u015aiva and all the other demigods, He is the Supreme Person of all\nplanets.\n\n\n\u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is therefore different from everything that is created, and anyone who\nknows Him as such immediately becomes liberated from all sinful reaction. One\nmust be liberated from all sinful activities to be in the knowledge of the\nSupreme Lord. Only by devotional service can He be known and not by any other\nmeans, as stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.\n\n\nOne should not try to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as a human being. As stated previously,\nonly a foolish person thinks Him to be a human being. This is again expressed\nhere in a different way. A man who is not foolish, who is intelligent enough to\nunderstand the constitutional position of the Godhead, is always free from all\nsinful reactions.\n\n\nIf K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is known as the son of Devak\u012b, then how can He be unborn? That is also\nexplained in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam: When He appeared before Devak\u012b and Vasudeva, He\nwas not born as an ordinary child; He appeared in His original form, and then He\ntransformed Himself into an ordinary child.\n\n\nAnything done under the direction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is transcendental. It cannot be\ncontaminated by the material reactions, which may be auspicious or inauspicious.\nThe conception that there are things auspicious and inauspicious in the material\nworld is more or less a mental concoction because there is nothing auspicious in\nthe material world. Everything is inauspicious because the very material mask is\ninauspicious. We simply imagine it to be auspicious. Real auspiciousness depends\non activities in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness in full devotion and service. Therefore if\nwe at all want our activities to he auspicious, then we should work under the\ndirections of the Supreme Lord. Such directions are given in authoritative\nscriptures such as \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam and Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, or from a bona fide\nspiritual master. Because the spiritual master is the representative of the\nSupreme Lord, his direction is directly the direction of the Supreme Lord. The\nspiritual master, saintly persons and scriptures direct in the same way. There\nis no contradiction in these three sources. All actions done under such\ndirection are free from the reactions of pious or impious activities of this\nmaterial world. The transcendental attitude of the devotee in the performance of\nactivities is actually that of renunciation, and this is called sanny\u0101sa. Anyone\nacting under the direction of the Supreme Lord is actually a sanny\u0101s\u012b and a\nyog\u012b, and not the man who has simply taken the dress of the sanny\u0101s\u012b, or a\npseudo-yog\u012b.\n\n\n10.4-5\n\n\nbuddhir j\u00f1\u0101nam asammoha\u1e25\n\n\nk\u1e63am\u0101 satya\u1e41 dama\u1e25 \u015bama\u1e25\n\n\nsukha\u1e41 du\u1e25kha\u1e41 bhavo \u2019bh\u0101vo\n\n\nbhaya\u1e41 c\u0101bhayam eva ca\n\n\nahi\u1e41s\u0101 samat\u0101 tu\u1e63\u1e6dis\n\n\ntapo d\u0101na\u1e41 ya\u015bo \u2019ya\u015ba\u1e25\n\n\nbhavanti bh\u0101v\u0101 bh\u016bt\u0101n\u0101\u1e41\n\n\nmatta eva p\u1e5bthag-vidh\u0101\u1e25\n\n\nbuddhi\u1e25\u2014intelligence; j\u00f1\u0101nam\u2014knowledge; asam-moha\u1e25\u2014freedom from doubt;\nk\u1e63am\u0101\u2014forgiveness; satyam\u2014truthfulness; dama\u1e25\u2014control of the senses;\n\u015bama\u1e25\u2014control of the mind; sukham\u2014happiness; du\u1e25kham\u2014distress; bhava\u1e25\u2014birth;\nabh\u0101va\u1e25\u2014death; bhayam\u2014fear; ca\u2014also; abhayam\u2014without fear; eva\u2014also; ca\u2014and;\nahi\u1e41s\u0101\u2014nonviolence; samat\u0101\u2014equilibrium; tu\u1e63\u1e6di\u1e25\u2014satisfaction; tapa\u1e25\u2014penance;\nd\u0101nam\u2014charity; ya\u015ba\u1e25\u2014fame; aya\u015ba\u1e25\u2014infamy; bhavanti\u2014become; bh\u0101v\u0101\u1e25\u2014natures;\nbh\u016bt\u0101n\u0101m\u2014of living entities; matta\u1e25\u2014from Me; eva\u2014certainly;\np\u1e5bthak-vidh\u0101\u1e25\u2014differently arranged.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nIntelligence, knowledge, freedom from doubt and delusion, forgiveness,\ntruthfulness, self-control and calmness, pleasure and pain, birth, death, fear,\nfearlessness, nonviolence, equanimity, satisfaction, austerity, charity, fame\nand infamy are created by Me alone.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe different qualities of living entities, be they good or bad, are all created\nby K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and they are described here.\n\n\nIntelligence refers to the power of analyzing things in proper perspective, and\nknowledge refers to understanding what is spirit and what is matter. Ordinary\nknowledge obtained by a university education pertains only to matter, and it is\nnot accepted here as knowledge. Knowledge means knowing the distinction between\nspirit and matter. In modern education there is no knowledge about the spirit;\nthey are simply taking care of the material elements and bodily needs. Therefore\nacademic knowledge is not complete.\n\n\nAsa\u1e41moha\u1e25, freedom from doubt and delusion, can be achieved when one is not\nhesitant and when he understands the transcendental philosophy. Slowly but\nsurely he becomes free from bewilderment. Nothing should be accepted blindly;\neverything should be accepted with care and with caution. K\u1e63am\u0101, forgiveness,\nshould be practiced, and one should excuse the minor offenses of others. Satyam,\ntruthfulness, means that facts should be presented as they are for the benefit\nof others. Facts should not be misrepresented. According to social conventions,\nit is said that one can speak the truth only when it is palatable to others. But\nthat is not truthfulness. The truth should be spoken in a straight and forward\nway, so that others will understand actually what the facts are. If a man is a\nthief and if people are warned that he is a thief, that is truth. Although\nsometimes the truth is unpalatable, one should not refrain from speaking it.\nTruthfulness demands that the facts be presented as they are for the benefit of\nothers. That is the definition of truth.\n\n\nSelf-control means that the senses should not be used for unnecessary personal\nenjoyment. There is no prohibition against meeting the proper needs of the\nsenses, but unnecessary sense enjoyment is detrimental for spiritual\nadvancement. Therefore the senses should be restrained from unnecessary use.\nSimilarly, the mind should not indulge in unnecessary thoughts; that is called\n\u015bama\u1e25, or calmness. Nor should one spend one\u2019s time pondering over earning\nmoney. That is a misuse of the thinking power. The mind should be used to\nunderstand the prime necessity of human beings, and that should be presented\nauthoritatively. The power of thought should be developed in association with\npersons who are authorities in the scriptures, saintly persons and spiritual\nmasters and those whose thinking is highly developed. Sukham, pleasure or\nhappiness, should always be in that which is favorable for the cultivation of\nthe spiritual knowledge of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. And similarly, that which is\npainful or which causes distress is that which is unfavorable for the\ncultivation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Anything favorable for the development of\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness should be accepted, and anything unfavorable should be\nrejected.\n\n\nBhava, birth, should be understood to refer to the body. As far as the soul is\nconcerned, there is neither birth nor death; that we have discussed in the\nbeginning of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Birth and death apply to one\u2019s embodiment in the\nmaterial world. Fear is due to worrying about the future. A person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness has no fear because by his activities he is sure to go back to the\nspiritual sky, back home, back to Godhead. Therefore his future is very bright.\nOthers, however, do not know what their future holds; they have no knowledge of\nwhat the next life holds. So they are therefore in constant anxiety. If we want\nto get free from anxiety, then the best course is to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and be\nsituated always in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. In that way we will be free from all\nfear. In the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. it is stated that fear is caused by our\nabsorption in the illusory energy, but those who are free from the illusory\nenergy, those who are confident that they are not the material body, that they\nare spiritual parts of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and are therefore\nengaged in the transcendental service of the Supreme Godhead, have nothing to\nfear. Their future is very bright. This fear is a condition of persons who are\nnot in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Bhayam, fearlessness, is only possible for one in\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\n\n\nAhi\u1e41s\u0101, nonviolence, means that one should not do anything which will put others\ninto misery or confusion. Material activities that are promised by so many\npoliticians, sociologists, philanthropists, etc., do not produce very good\nresults because the politicians and philanthropists have no transcendental\nvision; they do not know what is actually beneficial for human society. Ahi\u1e41s\u0101\nmeans that people should be trained in such a way that the full utilization of\nthe human body can be achieved. The human body is meant for spiritual\nrealization, so any movement or any commissions which do not further that end\ncommit violence on the human body. That which furthers the future spiritual\nhappiness of the people in general is called nonviolence.\n\n\nSamat\u0101, equanimity, refers to freedom from attachment and aversion. To be very\nmuch attached or to be very much detached is not the best. This material world\nshould be accepted without attachment or aversion. Similarly, that which is\nfavorable for prosecuting K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness should be accepted; that which is\nunfavorable should be rejected. That is called samat\u0101, equanimity. A person in\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness has nothing to reject and nothing to accept unless it is\nuseful in the prosecution of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\n\n\nTu\u1e63\u1e6di\u1e25, satisfaction, means that one should not be eager to gather more and more\nmaterial goods by unnecessary activity. One should be satisfied with whatever is\nobtained by the grace of the Supreme Lord; that is called satisfaction. Tapas\nmeans austerity or penance. There are many rules and definitions in the Vedas\nwhich apply here, like rising early in the morning and taking a bath. Sometimes\nit is very troublesome to rise early in the morning, but whatever voluntary\ntrouble one may suffer in this way is called penance. Similarly, there are\nprescriptions for fasting on certain days of the month. One may not be inclined\nto practice such fasting, but because of his determination to make advancement\nin the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, he should accept such bodily troubles\nwhich are recommended. However, one should not fast unnecessarily or against\nVedic injunctions. One should not fast for some political purpose; that is\ndescribed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 as fasting in ignorance, and anything done in\nignorance or passion does not lead to spiritual advancement. Everything done in\nthe mode of goodness does advance one, however, and fasting done in terms of the\nVedic injunctions enriches one in spiritual knowledge.\n\n\nAs far as charity is concerned, one should give fifty percent of his earnings to\nsome good cause. And what is a good cause? It is that which is conducted in\nterms of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. That is not only a good cause, but it is the best\ncause. Because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is good, His cause is also good. Thus charity should be\ngiven to a person who is engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. According to Vedic\nliterature, it is enjoined that charity should be given to the br\u0101hma\u1e47as. This\npractice is still followed, although not very nicely in terms of the Vedic\ninjunction. But still the injunction is that charity should be given to the\nbr\u0101hma\u1e47as. Why? Because they are engaged in higher cultivation of spiritual\nknowledge. A br\u0101hma\u1e47a is supposed to devote his whole life to understanding\nBrahman. A brahma-jana is one who knows Brahman; he is called a br\u0101hma\u1e47a. Thus\ncharity is offered to the br\u0101hma\u1e47as because since they are always engaged in\nhigher spiritual service, they have no time to earn their livelihood. In the\nVedic literature, charity is also to be awarded to the renouncer of life, the\nsanny\u0101s\u012b. The sanny\u0101s\u012bs beg from door to door, not for money but for missionary\npurposes. The system is that they go from door to door to awaken the\nhouseholders from the slumber of ignorance. Because the householders are engaged\nin family affairs and have forgotten their actual purpose in life\u2014awakening\ntheir K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness\u2014it is the business of the sanny\u0101s\u012bs to go as beggars\nto the householders and encourage them to be K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious. As it is said in\nthe Vedas, one should awake and achieve what is due him in this human form of\nlife. This knowledge and method is distributed by the sanny\u0101s\u012bs; hence charity\nis to be given to the renouncer of life, to the br\u0101hma\u1e47as, and similar good\ncauses, not to any whimsical cause.\n\n\nYa\u015ba\u1e25, fame, should be according to Lord Caitanya, who said that a man is famous\nwhen he is known as a great devotee. That is real fame. If one has become a\ngreat man in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and it is known, then he is truly famous. One\nwho does not have such fame is infamous.\n\n\nAll these qualities are manifest throughout the universe in human society and in\nthe society of the demigods. There are many forms of humanity on other planets,\nand these qualities are there. Now, for one who wants to advance in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a creates all these qualities, but the person develops them\nhimself from within. One who engages in the devotional service of the Supreme\nLord develops all the good qualities, as arranged by the Supreme Lord.\n\n\nOf whatever we find, good or bad, the origin is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Nothing can manifest in\nthis material world which is not in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. That is knowledge; although we know\nthat things are differently situated, we should realize that everything flows\nfrom K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\n\n\n10.6\n\n\nmahar\u1e63aya\u1e25 sapta p\u016brve\n\n\ncatv\u0101ro manavas tath\u0101\n\n\nmad-bh\u0101v\u0101 m\u0101nas\u0101 j\u0101t\u0101\n\n\nye\u1e63\u0101\u1e41 loka im\u0101\u1e25 praj\u0101\u1e25\n\n\nmahar\u1e63aya\u1e25\u2014the great sages; sapta\u2014seven; p\u016brve\u2014before; catv\u0101ra\u1e25\u2014four;\nmanava\u1e25\u2014Manus; tath\u0101\u2014also; mat-bh\u0101v\u0101\u1e25\u2014born of Me; m\u0101nas\u0101\u1e25\u2014from the mind;\nj\u0101t\u0101\u1e25\u2014born; ye\u1e63\u0101m\u2014of them; loke\u2014the planets; im\u0101\u1e25\u2014all this; praj\u0101\u1e25\u2014population.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThe seven great sages and before them the four other great sages and the Manus\n[progenitors of mankind] are born out of My mind, and all creatures in these\nplanets descend from them.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe Lord is giving a genealogical synopsis of the universal population. Brahm\u0101\nis the original creature born out of the energy of the Supreme Lord known as\nHira\u1e47yagarbha. And from Brahm\u0101 all the seven great sages, and before them four\nother great sages, named Sanaka, Sananda, San\u0101tana, and Sanatkum\u0101ra, and the\nManus, are manifest. All these twenty-five great sages are known as the\npatriarchs of the living entities all over the universe. There are innumerable\nuniverses and innumerable planets within each universe, and each planet is full\nof population of different varieties. All of them are born of these twenty-five\npatriarchs. Brahm\u0101 underwent penance for one thousand years of the demigods\nbefore he realized by the grace of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a how to create. Then from Brahm\u0101,\nSanaka, Sananda, San\u0101tana, and Sanatkum\u0101ra came out, then Rudra, and then the\nseven sages, and in this way all the br\u0101hma\u1e47as and k\u1e63atriyas are born out of the\nenergy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Brahm\u0101 is known as pit\u0101maha, the\ngrandfather, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is known as the prapit\u0101-maha, the father of the\ngrandfather. That is stated in the Eleventh Chapter of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.

Unless one is firmly convinced of the different\nopulences of the Supreme Lord, he cannot engage in devotional service. Generally\npeople know that God is great, but they do not know in detail how God is great.\nHere are the details. If one knows factually how God is great, then naturally he\nbecomes a surrendered soul and engages himself in the devotional service of the\nLord. When one factually knows the opulences of the Supreme, there is no\nalternative but to surrender to Him. This factual knowledge can be known from\nthe descriptions in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam and Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and similar literatures.\n\n\nIn the administration of this universe there are many demigods distributed\nthroughout the planetary system, and the chief of them are Brahm\u0101, Lord \u015aiva and\nthe four great Kum\u0101ras and other patriarchs. There are many forefathers of the\npopulation of the universe, and all of them are born of the Supreme Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\nThe Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is the original forefather of all\nforefathers.\n\n\nThese are some of the opulences of the Supreme Lord. When one is firmly\nconvinced of them, he accepts K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a with great faith and without any doubt, and\nhe engages in devotional service.

He can never be deviated by any\namount of nonsensical commentaries or by fools. All Vedic literature agrees that\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the source of Brahm\u0101, \u015aiva and all other demigods.

A K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person should not\nbe bewildered by fools; he should avoid all unauthorized commentaries and\ninterpretations on Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and proceed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness with\ndetermination and firmness.\n\n\n10.9\n\n\nmac-citt\u0101 mad-gata-pr\u0101\u1e47\u0101\n\n\nbodhayanta\u1e25 parasparam\n\n\nkathayanta\u015b ca m\u0101\u1e41 nitya\u1e41\n\n\ntu\u1e63yanti ca ramanti ca\n\n\nmat-citt\u0101\u1e25\u2014minds fully engaged in Me; mat-gata-pr\u0101\u1e47\u0101\u1e25\u2014lives devoted to the\nservice of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; bodhayanta\u1e25\u2014preaching; parasparam\u2014among themselves;\nkathayanta\u1e25 ca\u2014talking also; m\u0101m\u2014about Me; nityam\u2014perpetually; tu\u1e63yanti\u2014are\npleased; ca\u2014also; ramanti\u2014enjoy transcendental bliss; ca\u2014also.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThe thoughts of My pure devotees dwell in Me, their lives are surrendered to Me,\nand they derive great satisfaction and bliss enlightening one another and\nconversing about Me.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nPure devotees, whose characteristics are mentioned here, engage themselves fully\nin the transcendental loving service of the Lord. Their minds cannot be diverted\nfrom the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Their talks are solely on the transcendental\nsubjects. The symptoms of the pure devotees are described in this verse\nspecifically. Devotees of the Supreme Lord are twenty-four hours daily engaged\nin glorifying the pastimes of the Supreme Lord. Their hearts and souls are\nconstantly submerged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and they take pleasure in discussing Him with\nother devotees.\n\n\nIn the preliminary stage of devotional service they relish the transcendental\npleasure from the service itself, and in the mature stage they are actually\nsituated in love of God. Once situated in that transcendental position, they can\nrelish the highest perfection which is exhibited by the Lord in His abode. Lord\nCaitanya likens transcendental devotional service to the sowing of a seed in the\nheart of the living entity. There are innumerable living entities traveling\nthroughout the different planets of the universe, and out of them there are a\nfew who are fortunate enough to meet a pure devotee and get the chance to\nunderstand devotional service. This devotional service is just like a seed, and\nif it is sown in the heart of a living entity, and if he goes on hearing and\nchanting, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma,\nR\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare, that seed fructifies, just as the seed of a tree\nfructifies with regular watering. The spiritual plant of devotional service\ngradually grows and grows until it penetrates the covering of the material\nuniverse and enters into the brahmajyoti effulgence in the spiritual sky. In the\nspiritual sky also that plant grows more and more until it reaches the highest\nplanet, which is called Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, the supreme planet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\nUltimately, the plant takes shelter under the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and rests\nthere. Gradually, as a plant grows fruits and flowers, that plant of devotional\nservice also produces fruits, and the watering process in the form of chanting\nand hearing goes on. This plant of devotional service is fully described in the\nCaitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta. It is explained there that when the complete plant takes\nshelter under the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord, one becomes fully absorbed in\nlove of God; then he cannot live even for a moment without being in contact with\nthe Supreme Lord, just as a fish cannot live without water. In such a state, the\ndevotee actually attains the transcendental qualities in contact with the\nSupreme Lord.\n\n\nThe \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam is also full of such narration about the relationship\nbetween the Supreme Lord and His devotees; therefore the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam is\nvery dear to the devotees. In this narration there is nothing about material\nactivities, sense gratification or liberation. \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam is the only\nnarration in which the transcendental nature of the Supreme Lord and His\ndevotees is fully described. Thus the realized souls in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness take\ncontinual pleasure in hearing such transcendental literatures, just as a young\nboy and girl take pleasure in association.\n\n\n10.10\n\n\nte\u1e63\u0101\u1e41 satata-yukt\u0101n\u0101\u1e41\n\n\nbhajat\u0101\u1e41 pr\u012bti-p\u016brvakam\n\n\ndad\u0101mi buddhi-yoga\u1e41 ta\u1e41\n\n\nyena m\u0101m upay\u0101nti te\n\n\nte\u1e63\u0101m\u2014unto them; satata-yukt\u0101n\u0101m\u2014always engaged; bhajat\u0101m\u2014in devotional service;\npr\u012bti-p\u016brvakam\u2014in loving ecstasy; dad\u0101mi\u2014I give; buddhi-yogam\u2014real intelligence;\ntam\u2014that; yena\u2014by which; m\u0101m\u2014unto Me; upay\u0101nti\u2014come; te\u2014they.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nTo those who are constantly devoted and worship Me with love, I give the\nunderstanding by which they can come to Me.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nIn this verse the word buddhi-yogam is very significant. We may remember that in\nthe Second Chapter the Lord, instructing Arjuna, said that He had spoken to him\nof many things and that He would instruct him in the way of buddhi-yoga. Now\nbuddhi-yoga is explained. Buddhi-yogam itself is action in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness;\nthat is the highest intelligence. Buddhi means intelligence, and yogam means\nmystic activities or mystic elevation. When one tries to go back home, back to\nGodhead, and takes fully to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness in devotional service, his\naction is called buddhi-yogam. In other words, buddhi-yogam is the process by\nwhich one gets out of the entanglement of this material world. The ultimate goal\nof progress is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. People do not know this; therefore the association of\ndevotees and a bona fide spiritual master are important. One should know that\nthe goal is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and when the goal is assigned, then the path is slowly but\nprogressively traversed, and the ultimate goal is achieved.\n\n\nWhen a person knows the goal of life but is addicted to the fruits of\nactivities, he is acting in karma-yoga. When he knows that the goal is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a,\nbut he takes pleasure in mental speculations to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he is acting\nin j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga. And when he knows the goal and seeks K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a completely in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness and devotional service, he is acting in bhakti-yoga, or\nbuddhi-yoga, which is the complete yoga. This complete yoga is the highest\nperfectional stage of life.\n\n\nA person may have a bona fide spiritual master and may be attached to a\nspiritual organization, but still, if he is not intelligent enough to make\nprogress, then K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a from within gives him instructions so that he may\nultimately come to Him without difficulty. The qualification is that a person\nalways engage himself in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and with love and devotion render\nall kinds of services. He should perform some sort of work for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and that\nwork should be with love. If a devotee is intelligent enough, he will make\nprogress on the path of self-realization. If one is sincere and devoted to the\nactivities of devotional service, the Lord gives him a chance to make progress\nand ultimately attain to Him.\n\n\n10.11\n\n\nte\u1e63\u0101m ev\u0101nukamp\u0101rtham\n\n\naham aj\u00f1\u0101na-ja\u1e41 tama\u1e25\n\n\nn\u0101\u015bay\u0101my \u0101tma-bh\u0101va-stho\n\n\nj\u00f1\u0101na-d\u012bpena bh\u0101svat\u0101\n\n\nte\u1e63\u0101m\u2014for them; eva\u2014certainly; anukamp\u0101-artham\u2014to show special mercy; aham\u2014I;\naj\u00f1\u0101na-jam\u2014due to ignorance; tama\u1e25\u2014darkness; n\u0101\u015bay\u0101mi\u2014dispel; \u0101tma\u2014within;\nbh\u0101vastha\u1e25\u2014themselves; j\u00f1\u0101na\u2014of knowledge; d\u012bpena\u2014with the lamp;\nbh\u0101svat\u0101\u2014glowing.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nOut of compassion for them, I, dwelling in their hearts, destroy with the\nshining lamp of knowledge the darkness born of ignorance.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nWhen Lord Caitanya was in Benares promulgating the chanting of Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare,\nthousands of people were following Him. Prak\u0101\u015b\u0101nanda, a very influential and\nlearned scholar in Benares at that time, derided Lord Caitanya for being a\nsentimentalist. Sometimes philosophers criticize the devotees because they think\nthat most of the devotees are in the darkness of ignorance and are\nphilosophically naive sentimentalists. Actually that is not the fact. There are\nvery, very learned scholars who have put forward the philosophy of devotion, but\neven if a devotee does not take advantage of their literatures or of his\nspiritual master, if he is sincere in his devotional service he is helped by\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself within his heart. So the sincere devotee engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness cannot be without knowledge. The only qualification is that one\ncarry out devotional service in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\n\n\nThe modern philosophers think that without discriminating one cannot have pure\nknowledge. For them this answer is given by the Supreme Lord: those who are\nengaged in pure devotional service, even though they be without sufficient\neducation and even without sufficient knowledge of the Vedic principles, are\nstill helped by the Supreme God, as stated in this verse.\n\n\nThe Lord tells Arjuna that basically there is no possibility of understanding\nthe Supreme Truth, the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead,\nsimply by speculating, for the Supreme Truth is so great that it is not possible\nto understand Him or to achieve Him simply by making a mental effort. Man can go\non speculating for several millions of years, and if he is not devoted, if he is\nnot a lover of the Supreme Truth, he will never understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or the Supreme\nTruth. Only by devotional service is the Supreme Truth, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, pleased, and by\nHis inconceivable energy He can reveal Himself to the heart of the pure devotee.\nThe pure devotee always has K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a within his heart; therefore he is just like\nthe sun that dissipates the darkness of ignorance. This is the special mercy\nrendered to the pure devotee by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\n\n\nDue to the contamination of material association, through many, many millions of\nbirths, one\u2019s heart is always covered with the dust of materialism, but when one\nengages in devotional service and constantly chants Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the dust quickly\nclears, and one is elevated to the platform of pure knowledge. The ultimate goal\nof Vi\u1e63\u1e47u can be attained only by this chant and by devotional service, and not\nby mental speculation or argument. The pure devotee does not have to worry about\nthe necessities of life; he need not be anxious because when he removes the\ndarkness from his heart, everything is provided automatically by the Supreme\nLord, for He is pleased by the loving devotional service of the devotee. This is\nthe essence of the G\u012bt\u0101\u2019s teachings. By studying Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, one can become a\ncompletely surrendered soul to the Supreme Lord and engage himself in pure\ndevotional service.

All the great sages such as N\u0101rada, Asita, Devala, and Vy\u0101sa proclaim\nthis of You, and now You Yourself are declaring it to me.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nIn these two verses the Supreme Lord gives a chance to the modern philosopher,\nfor here it is clear that the Supreme is different from the individual soul.\nArjuna, after hearing the essential four verses of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 in this\nchapter, became completely free from all doubts and accepted K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead. He at once boldly declares, \u201cYou are\nParambrahma, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\u201d And previously K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a states\nthat He is the originator of everything and everyone. Every demigod and every\nhuman being is dependant on Him. Men and demigods, out of ignorance, think that\nthey are absolute and independant of the Supreme Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. That ignorance is\nremoved perfectly by the discharge of devotional service. This is already\nexplained in the previous verse by the Lord. Now by His grace, Arjuna is\naccepting Him as the Supreme Truth, in concordance with the Vedic injunction. It\nis not because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is an intimate friend of Arjuna that he is flattering Him\nby calling Him the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth. Whatever\nArjuna says in these two verses is confirmed by Vedic truth. Vedic injunctions\naffirm that only one who takes to devotional service to the Supreme Lord can\nunderstand Him, whereas others cannot. Each and every word of this verse spoken\nby Arjuna is confirmed by Vedic injunction.\n\n\nIn the Kena Upani\u1e63ad it is stated that the Supreme Brahman is the rest for\neverything, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has already explained that everything is resting on Him.\nThe Mu\u1e47\u1e0daka Upani\u1e63ad confirms that the Supreme Lord, in whom everything is\nresting, can be realized only by those who engage constantly in thinking of Him.\nThis constant thinking of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is smara\u1e47am, one of the methods of devotional\nservice. It is only by devotional service to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a that one can understand his\nposition and get rid of this material body.\n\n\nIn the Vedas the Supreme Lord is accepted as the purest of the pure. One who\nunderstands that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the purest of the pure can become purified from all\nsinful activities. One cannot be disinfected from sinful activities unless he\nsurrenders unto the Supreme Lord. Arjuna\u2019s acceptance of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the supreme\npure complies with the injunctions of Vedic literature. This is also confirmed\nby great personalities, of whom N\u0101rada is the chief.\n\n\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and one should always meditate upon\nHim and enjoy one\u2019s transcendental relationship with Him. He is the supreme\nexistence. He is free from bodily needs, birth and death. Not only does Arjuna\nconfirm this, but all the Vedic literatures. the Pur\u0101\u1e47as and histories. In all\nVedic literatures K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is thus described, and the Supreme Lord Himself also\nsays in the Fourth Chapter, \u201cAlthough I am unborn, I appear on this earth to\nestablish religious principles.\u201d He is the supreme origin; He has no cause, for\nHe is the cause of all causes, and everything is emanating from Him. This\nperfect knowledge can be had by the grace of the Supreme Lord.\n\n\nHere Arjuna expresses himself through the grace of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. If we want to\nunderstand Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, we should accept the statements in these two verses.\nThis is called the parampar\u0101 system, acceptance of the disciplic succession.\nUnless one is in the disciplic succession, he cannot understand Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.\nIt is not possible by so-called academic education. Unfortunately those proud of\ntheir academic education, despite so much evidence in Vedic literatures, stick\nto their obstinate conviction that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is an ordinary person.\n\n\n10.14\n\n\nsarvam etad \u1e5bta\u1e41 manye\n\n\nyan m\u0101\u1e41 vadasi ke\u015bava\n\n\nna hi te bhagavan vyakti\u1e41\n\n\nvidur dev\u0101 na d\u0101nav\u0101\u1e25\n\n\nsarvam\u2014all; etat\u2014these; \u1e5btam\u2014truths; manye\u2014accept; yat\u2014which; m\u0101m\u2014unto me;\nvadasi\u2014You tell; ke\u015bava\u2014O K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; na\u2014never; hi\u2014certainly; te\u2014Your; bhagavan\u2014O\nPersonality of Godhead; vyaktim\u2014revelation; vidu\u1e25\u2014can know; deva\u1e25\u2014the demigods;\nna\u2014nor; d\u0101nav\u0101\u1e25\u2014the demons.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nO K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, I totally accept as truth all that You have told me.

He is not even known by the demigods, so what to speak of the\nso-called scholars of this modern world? By the grace of the Supreme Lord,\nArjuna has understood that the Supreme Truth is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and that He is the perfect\none. One should therefore follow the path of Arjuna. He received the authority\nof Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. As described in the Fourth Chapter, the parampar\u0101 system of\ndisciplic succession for the understanding of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 was lost, and\ntherefore K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a reestablished that disciplic succession with Arjuna because He\nconsidered Arjuna His intimate friend and a great devotee. Therefore, as stated\nin our Introduction to G\u012btopani\u1e63ad, Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 should be understood in the\nparampar\u0101 system. When the parampar\u0101 system was lost, Arjuna was again selected\nto rejuvenate it. The acceptance of Arjuna of all that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says should be\nemulated; then we can understand the essence of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, and then only can\nwe understand that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\n\n\n10.15\n\n\nsvayam ev\u0101tman\u0101tm\u0101na\u1e41\n\n\nvettha tva\u1e41 puru\u1e63ottama\n\n\nbh\u016bta-bh\u0101vana bh\u016bte\u015ba\n\n\ndeva-deva jagat-pate\n\n\nsvayam\u2014personality; eva\u2014certainly; \u0101tman\u0101\u2014by Yourself; \u0101tm\u0101nam\u2014Yourself;\nvettha\u2014know; tvam\u2014You; puru\u1e63ottama\u2014O greatest of all persons; bh\u016bta-bh\u0101vana\u2014O\norigin of everything; bh\u016bte\u015ba\u2014O Lord of everything; deva-deva\u2014O Lord of all\ndemigods; jagat-pate\u2014O Lord of the entire universe.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nIndeed, You alone know Yourself by Your own potencies, O origin of all, Lord of\nall beings, God of gods, O Supreme Person, Lord of the universe!\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe Supreme Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can be known by persons who are in a relationship with\nHim through the discharge of devotional service, like Arjuna and his successors.\nPersons of demonic or atheistic mentality cannot know K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Mental speculation\nthat leads one away from the Supreme Lord is a serious sin, and one who does not\nknow K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a should not try to comment on Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is the\nstatement of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and since it is the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, it should be\nunderstood from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as Arjuna understood it. It should not be received from\natheistic persons.\n\n\nThe Supreme Truth is realized in three aspects: as impersonal Brahman, localized\nParam\u0101tm\u0101 and at last as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. So at the last\nstage of understanding the Absolute Truth, one comes to the Supreme Personality\nof Godhead. A liberated man and even a common man may realize impersonal Brahman\nor localized Param\u0101tm\u0101, yet they may not understand God\u2019s personality from the\nverses of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, which are being spoken by this person, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Sometimes\nthe impersonalists accept K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as Bhagavan, or they accept His authority. Yet\nmany liberated persons cannot understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as Puru\u1e63ottama, the Supreme\nPerson, the father of all living entities. Therefore Arjuna addresses Him as\nPuru\u1e63ottama. And if one comes to know Him as the father of all the living\nentities, still one may not know Him as the supreme controller; therefore He is\naddressed here as Bh\u016bte\u015ba, the supreme controller of everyone. And even if one\nknows K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the supreme controller of all living entities, still one may not\nknow that He is the origin of all the demigods; therefore He is addressed herein\nas Devadeva, the worshipful God of all demigods. And even if one knows Him as\nthe worshipful God of all demigods, one may not know that He is the supreme\nproprietor of everything; therefore He is addressed as Jagatpati. Thus the truth\nabout K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is established in this verse by the realization of Arjuna, and we\nshould follow in the footsteps of Arjuna to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as He is.\n\n\n10.16\n\n\nvaktum arhasy a\u015be\u1e63e\u1e47a\n\n\ndivy\u0101 hy \u0101tma-vibh\u016btaya\u1e25\n\n\ny\u0101bhir vibh\u016btibhir lok\u0101n\n\n\nim\u0101\u1e41s tva\u1e41 vy\u0101pya ti\u1e63\u1e6dhasi\n\n\nvaktum\u2014to say; arhasi\u2014deserve; a\u015be\u1e63e\u1e47a\u2014in detail; divy\u0101\u2014divine; hi\u2014certainly;\n\u0101tma\u2014Yourself; vibh\u016btaya\u1e25\u2014opulences; y\u0101bhi\u1e25\u2014by which; vibh\u016btibhi\u1e25\u2014opulences;\nlok\u0101n\u2014all the planets; im\u0101n\u2014these; tvam\u2014You; vy\u0101pya\u2014pervading; ti\u1e63\u1e6dhasi\u2014remain.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nPlease tell me in detail of Your divine powers by which You pervade all these\nworlds and abide in them.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nIn this verse it appears that Arjuna is already satisfied with his understanding\nof the Supreme Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. By K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s grace, Arjuna has personal experience,\nintelligence and knowledge and whatever else a person may have through all these\nagencies, and he has understood K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. For\nhim there is no doubt, Yet he is asking K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to explain His all-pervading\nnature so that in the future people will understand, especially the\nimpersonalists, how He exists in His all-pervading aspect through His different\nenergies.

In what various forms are You to be contemplated,\nO Blessed Lord?\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nAs it is stated in the previous chapter, the Supreme Personality of Godhead is\ncovered by His yoga-m\u0101y\u0101. Only surrendered souls and devotees can see Him. Now\nArjuna is convinced that His friend, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is the Supreme Godhead, but he wants\nto know the general process by which the all-pervading Lord can be understood by\nthe common man. No common man, including the demons and atheists, can know K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nbecause He is guarded by His yoga-m\u0101y\u0101 energy. Again, these questions are asked\nby Arjuna for their benefit. The superior devotee is not only concerned for his\nown understanding, but for the understanding of all mankind. Out of his mercy,\nbecause he is a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, a devotee, Arjuna is opening the understanding for the\ncommon man as far as the all-pervasiveness of the Supreme is concerned. He\naddresses K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a specifically as yogin because \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the master of the\nyoga-m\u0101y\u0101 energy by which He is covered and uncovered to the common man. The\ncommon man who has no love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a cannot always think of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; therefore he\nhas to think materially. Arjuna is considering the mode of thinking of the\nmaterialistic persons of this world. Because materialists cannot understand\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a spiritually, they are advised to concentrate the mind on physical things\nand try to see how K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is manifested by physical representations.\n\n\n10.18\n\n\nvistare\u1e47\u0101tmano yoga\u1e41\n\n\nvibh\u016bti\u1e41 ca jan\u0101rdana\n\n\nbh\u016bya\u1e25 kathaya t\u1e5bptir hi\n\n\n\u015b\u1e5b\u1e47vato n\u0101sti me \u2019m\u1e5btam\n\n\nvistare\u1e47a\u2014in description; \u0101tmana\u1e25\u2014of Yourself; yogam\u2014mystic power;\nvibh\u016btim\u2014opulences; ca\u2014also; jan\u0101rdana\u2014O killer of the atheists; bh\u016bya\u1e25\u2014again;\nkathaya\u2014describe; t\u1e5bpti\u1e25\u2014satisfaction; hi\u2014certainly; \u015b\u1e5b\u1e47vata\u1e25\u2014hearing; na\nasti\u2014there is no; me\u2014my; am\u1e5btam\u2014nectar.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nTell me again in detail, O Jan\u0101rdana [K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a], of Your mighty potencies and\nglories, for I never tire of hearing Your ambrosial words.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nA similar statement was made to S\u016bta Gosv\u0101m\u012b by the \u1e5b\u1e63is of Naimi\u1e63\u0101ra\u1e47ya, headed\nby \u015aaunaka.

Those who have entered into\na transcendental relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a relish in every step descriptions of\nthe pastimes of the Lord.\u201d Thus Arjuna is interested to hear about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a,\nspecifically how He remains as the all-pervading Supreme Lord.\n\n\nNow as far as am\u1e5btam, nectar, is concerned, any narration or statement\nconcerning K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is just like nectar. And this nectar can be perceived by\npractical experience. Modern stories, fiction and histories are different from\nthe transcendental pastimes of the Lord in that one will tire of hearing mundane\nstories, but one never tires of hearing about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. It is for this reason only\nthat the history of the whole universe is replete with references to the\npastimes of the incarnations of Godhead. For instance, the Pur\u0101\u1e47as are histories\nof bygone ages that relate the pastimes of the various incarnations of the Lord.\nIn this way the reading matter remains forever fresh, despite repeated readings.\n\n\n10.19\n\n\n\u015br\u012b-bhagav\u0101n uv\u0101ca\n\n\nhanta te kathayi\u1e63y\u0101mi\n\n\ndivy\u0101 hy \u0101tma-vibh\u016btaya\u1e25\n\n\npr\u0101dh\u0101nyata\u1e25 kuru-\u015bre\u1e63\u1e6dha\n\n\nn\u0101sty anto vistarasya me\n\n\n\u015br\u012b bhagav\u0101n uv\u0101ca\u2014the Supreme Personality of Godhead said; hanta\u2014yes; te\u2014unto\nyou; kathayi\u1e63y\u0101mi\u2014I shall speak; divy\u0101\u1e25\u2014divine; hi\u2014certainly;\n\u0101tma-vibh\u016btaya\u1e25\u2014personal opulences; pr\u0101dh\u0101nyata\u1e25\u2014principally; kuru\u015bre\u1e63\u1e6dha\u2014O best\nof the Kurus; na asti\u2014there is no; anta\u1e25\u2014limit; vistarasya\u2014to the extent; me\u2014My.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThe Blessed Lord said: Yes, I will tell you of My splendorous manifestations,\nbut only of those which are prominent, O Arjuna, for My opulence is limitless.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nIt is not possible to comprehend the greatness of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and His opulences. The\nsenses of the individual soul are imperfect and do not permit him to understand\nthe totality of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s affairs. Still the devotees try to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but\nnot on the principle that they will be able to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a fully at any\nspecific time or in any state of life. Rather, the very topics of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are so\nrelishable that they appear to them as nectar. Thus they enjoy them. In\ndiscussing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s opulences and His diverse energies, the pure devotees take\ntranscendental pleasure. Therefore they want to hear and discuss them. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nknows that living entities do not understand the extent of His opulences; He\ntherefore agrees to state only the principal manifestations of His different\nenergies. The word pr\u0101dh\u0101nyata\u1e25 (principal) is very important because we can\nunderstand only a few of the principal details of the Supreme Lord, for His\nfeatures are unlimited. It is not possible to understand them all. And vibh\u016bti,\nas used in this verse, refers to the opulences by which He controls the whole\nmanifestation. In the Amara-ko\u015ba dictionary it is stated that vibh\u016bti indicates\nan exceptional opulence.\n\n\nThe impersonalist or the pantheist cannot understand the exceptional opulences\nof the Supreme Lord nor the manifestations of His divine energy. Both in the\nmaterial world and in the spiritual world His energies are distributed in every\nvariety of manifestation. Now K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is describing what can be directly perceived\nby the common man; thus part of His variegated energy is described in this way.\n\n\n10.20\n\n\naham \u0101tm\u0101 gu\u1e0d\u0101ke\u015ba\n\n\nsarva-bh\u016bt\u0101\u015baya-sthita\u1e25\n\n\naham \u0101di\u015b ca madhya\u1e41 ca\n\n\nbh\u016bt\u0101n\u0101m anta eva ca\n\n\naham\u2014I; \u0101tm\u0101\u2014soul; gu\u1e0d\u0101ke\u015ba\u2014O Arjuna; sarva-bh\u016bta\u2014all living entities;\n\u0101\u015baya-sthita\u1e25\u2014situated within; aham\u2014I am; \u0101di\u1e25\u2014origin; ca\u2014also; madhyam\u2014middle;\nca\u2014also; bh\u016bt\u0101n\u0101m\u2014all living entities; anta\u1e25\u2014end; eva\u2014certainly; ca\u2014and.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nI am the Self, O Gu\u1e0d\u0101ke\u015ba, seated in the hearts of all creatures.

For those who are sleeping in the darkness of ignorance,\nit is not possible to understand how the Supreme Godhead manifests Himself in\nthe material and spiritual worlds. Thus this address by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to Arjuna is\nsignificant. Because Arjuna is above such darkness, the Personality of Godhead\nagrees to describe His various opulences.\n\n\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a first informs Arjuna that He is the Self or soul of the entire cosmic\nmanifestation by dint of His primary expansion. Before the material creation,\nthe Supreme Lord, by His plenary expansion, accepts the Puru\u1e63a incarnations, and\nfrom Him everything begins. Therefore He is \u0101tm\u0101, the soul of the mahat-tattva,\nthe universal elements. The total material energy is not the cause of the\ncreation, but actually the Mah\u0101-Vis\u1e47u enters into the mahat-tattva, the total\nmaterial energy. He is the soul. When Mah\u0101-Vi\u1e63\u1e47u enters into the manifested\nuniverses, He again manifests Himself as the Supersoul in each and every entity.\nWe have experience that the personal body of the living entity exists due to the\npresence of the spiritual spark. Without the existence of the spiritual spark,\nthe body cannot develop. Similarly, the material manifestation cannot develop\nunless the Supreme Soul of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a enters.\n\n\nThe Supreme Personality of Godhead is existing as the Supersoul in all\nmanifested universes.

Amongst the regulated poetry,\nthe G\u0101yatr\u012b mantra, which is chanted by the duly qualified br\u0101hma\u1e47as, is the\nmost prominent. The G\u0101yatr\u012b mantra is mentioned in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam.\nBecause the G\u0101yatr\u012b mantra is especially meant for God realization, it\nrepresents the Supreme Lord. This mantra is meant for spiritually advanced\npeople, and when one attains success in chanting it, he can enter into the\ntranscendental position of the Lord. One must first acquire the qualities of the\nperfectly situated person, the qualities of goodness according to the laws of\nmaterial nature, in order to chant the G\u0101yatr\u012b mantra. The G\u0101yatr\u012b mantra is\nvery important in Vedic civilization and is considered to be the sound\nincarnation of Brahman. Brahm\u0101 is its initiator, and it is passed down from him\nin disciplic succession.\n\n\nThe months of November and December are considered the best of all months\nbecause in India grains are collected from the fields at this time, and the\npeople become very happy. Of course spring is a season universally liked because\nit is neither too hot nor too cold, and the flowers and trees blossom and\nflourish. In spring there are also many ceremonies commemorating K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s\npastimes; therefore this is considered to be the most joyful of all seasons, and\nit is the representative of the Supreme Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\n\n\n10.36\n\n\ndy\u016bta\u1e41 chalayat\u0101m asmi\n\n\ntejas tejasvin\u0101m aham\n\n\njayo \u2019smi vyavas\u0101yo \u2019smi\n\n\nsattva\u1e41 sattvavat\u0101m aham\n\n\ndy\u016btam\u2014gambling; chalayat\u0101m\u2014of all cheats; asmi\u2014I am; teja\u1e25\u2014splendid;\ntejasvin\u0101m\u2014of everything splendid; aham\u2014I am; jaya\u1e25\u2014victory; asmi\u2014I am;\nvyavas\u0101ya\u1e25\u2014adventure; asmi\u2014I am; sattvam\u2014strength; sattvavat\u0101m\u2014of all the\nstrong; aham\u2014I am.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nI am also the gambling of cheats, and of the splendid I am the splendor.

When miscreants are punished, the rod of chastisement\nrepresents K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Among those who are trying to be victorious in some field of\nactivity, the most victorious element is morality. Among the confidential\nactivities of hearing, thinking and meditating, silence is most important\nbecause by silence one can make progress very quickly. The wise man is he who\ncan discriminate between matter and spirit, between God\u2019s superior and inferior\nnatures.

With a single\nfragment of Myself I pervade and support this entire universe.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe Supreme Lord is represented throughout the entire material universes by His\nentering into all things as the Supersoul. The Lord here tells Arjuna that there\nis no point in understanding how things exist in their separate opulence and\ngrandeur. He should know that all things are existing due to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s entering\nthem as Supersoul. From Brahm\u0101, the most gigantic entity, on down to the\nsmallest ant, all are existing because the Lord has entered each and all and is\nsustaining them.\n\n\nWorship of demigods is discouraged herein because even the greatest demigods\nlike Brahm\u0101 and \u015aiva only represent part of the opulence of the Supreme Lord. He\nis the origin of everyone born, and no one is greater than Him. He is samat\u0101,\nwhich means that no one is superior to Him and that no one is equal to Him. In\nthe Vi\u1e63\u1e47u-mantra it is said that one who considers the Supreme Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in the\nsame category with demigods\u2014be they even Brahm\u0101 or \u015aiva\u2014becomes at once an\natheist. If, however, one thoroughly studies the different descriptions of the\nopulences and expansions of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s energy, then one can understand without any\ndoubt the position of Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and can fix his mind in the worship of\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a without deviation. The Lord is all-pervading by the expansion of His\npartial representation, the Supersoul, who enters into everything that is. Pure\ndevotees, therefore, concentrate their minds in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness in full\ndevotional service; therefore they are always situated in the transcendental\nposition. Devotional service and worship of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are very clearly indicated in\nthis chapter in verses eight to eleven. That is the way of pure devotional\nservice. How one can attain the highest devotional perfection of association\nwith the Supreme Personality of Godhead has been thoroughly explained in this\nchapter.",

TRANSLATION  The Supreme Lord said: My dear friend, mighty-armed Arjuna, listen again to My\nsupreme word, which I shall impart to you for your benefit and which will give\nyou great joy.  PURPORT  The word paramam is explained thus by Par\u0101\u015bara Muni: one who is full in six\nopulences, who has full strength, full fame, wealth, knowledge, beauty and\nrenunciation, is paramam, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead. While K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was\npresent on this earth, He displayed all six opulences. Therefore great sages\nlike Par\u0101\u015bara Muni have all accepted K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead. Now K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is instructing Arjuna in more confidential knowledge of His\nopulences and His work. Previously, beginning with the Seventh Chapter, the Lord\nalready explained His different energies and how they are acting. Now in this\nchapter He explains His specific opulences to Arjuna. In the previous chapter he\nhas clearly explained His different energies to establish devotion in firm\nconviction. Again in this chapter He tells Arjuna about His manifestations and\nvarious opulences.  The more one hears about the Supreme God, the more one becomes fixed in\ndevotional service. One should always hear about the Lord in the association of\ndevotees; that will enhance one\u2019s devotional service. Discourses in the society\nof devotees can take place only among those who are really anxious to be in\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Others cannot take part in such discourses. The Lord\nclearly tells Arjuna that because he is very dear to Him, for his benefit such\ndiscourses are taking place.",

TRANSLATION  Neither the hosts of demigods nor the great sages know My origin, for, in every\nrespect, I am the source of the demigods and the sages.  PURPORT  As stated in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Lord. No one is\ngreater than Him; He is the cause of all causes. Here it is also stated by the\nLord personally that He is the cause of all the demigods and sages. Even the\ndemigods and great sages cannot understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; they can understand neither\nHis name nor His personality, so what is the position of the so-called scholars\nof this tiny planet? No one can understand why this Supreme God comes to earth\nas an ordinary human being and executes such commonplace and yet wonderful\nactivities. One should know, then, that scholarship is not the qualification\nnecessary to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Even the demigods and the great sages have tried\nto understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by their mental speculation, and they have failed to do so.\nIn the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam also it is clearly said that even the great demigods\nare not able to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. They can\nspeculate to the limits of their imperfect senses and can reach the opposite\nconclusion of impersonalism, of something not manifested by the three qualities\nof material nature, or they can imagine something by mental speculation, but it\nis not possible to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by such foolish speculation.  Here the Lord indirectly says that if anyone wants to know the Absolute Truth,\n\u201cHere I am present as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. I am the Supreme.\u201d One\nshould know this. Although one cannot understand the inconceivable Lord who is\npersonally present, He nonetheless exists. We can actually understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who\nis eternal, full of bliss and knowledge, simply by studying His words in\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. The impersonal Brahman can be conceived by\npersons who are already in the inferior energy of the Lord, but the Personality\nof Godhead cannot be conceived unless one is in the transcendental position.  Because most men cannot understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in His actual situation, out of His\ncauseless mercy He descends to show favor to such speculators. Yet despite the\nSupreme Lord\u2019s uncommon activities, these speculators, due to contamination in\nthe material energy, still think that the impersonal Brahman is the Supreme.\nOnly the devotees who are fully surrendered unto the Supreme Lord can\nunderstand, by the grace of the Supreme Personality, that He is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The\ndevotees of the Lord do not bother about the impersonal Brahman conception of\nGod; their faith and devotion bring them to surrender immediately unto the\nSupreme Lord, and out of the causeless mercy of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, they can understand\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. No one else can understand Him. So even great sages agree: What is \u0101tm\u0101,\nwhat is the Supreme? It is He whom we have to worship.",

TRANSLATION  He who knows Me as the unborn, as the beginningless, as the Supreme Lord of all\nthe worlds\u2014he, undeluded among men, is freed from all sins.  PURPORT  As stated in the Seventh Chapter, those who are trying to elevate themselves to\nthe platform of spiritual realization are not ordinary men. They are superior to\nmillions and millions of ordinary men who have no knowledge of spiritual\nrealization, but out of those actually trying to understand their spiritual\nsituation, one who can come to the understanding that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead, the proprietor of everything, the unborn, is the most\nsuccessful spiritually realized person. In that stage only, when one has fully\nunderstood K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s supreme position, can one be free completely from all sinful\nreactions.  Here the word ajam, meaning unborn, should not be confused with the living\nentities, who are described in the Second Chapter as ajam. The Lord is different\nfrom the living entities who are taking birth and dying due to material\nattachment. The conditional souls are changing their bodies, but His body is not\nchangeable. Even when He comes to this material world, He comes as the same\nunborn; therefore in the Fourth Chapter it is said that the Lord, by His\ninternal potency, is not under the inferior material energy, but is always in\nthe superior energy.  He was existing before the creation, and He is different from His creation. All\nthe demigods were created within this material world, but as far as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is\nconcerned, it is said that He is not created; therefore K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is different even\nfrom the great demigods like Brahm\u0101 and \u015aiva. And because He is the creator of\nBrahm\u0101, \u015aiva and all the other demigods, He is the Supreme Person of all\nplanets.  \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is therefore different from everything that is created, and anyone who\nknows Him as such immediately becomes liberated from all sinful reaction. One\nmust be liberated from all sinful activities to be in the knowledge of the\nSupreme Lord. Only by devotional service can He be known and not by any other\nmeans, as stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.  One should not try to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as a human being. As stated previously,\nonly a foolish person thinks Him to be a human being. This is again expressed\nhere in a different way. A man who is not foolish, who is intelligent enough to\nunderstand the constitutional position of the Godhead, is always free from all\nsinful reactions.  If K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is known as the son of Devak\u012b, then how can He be unborn? That is also\nexplained in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam: When He appeared before Devak\u012b and Vasudeva, He\nwas not born as an ordinary child; He appeared in His original form, and then He\ntransformed Himself into an ordinary child.  Anything done under the direction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is transcendental. It cannot be\ncontaminated by the material reactions, which may be auspicious or inauspicious.\nThe conception that there are things auspicious and inauspicious in the material\nworld is more or less a mental concoction because there is nothing auspicious in\nthe material world. Everything is inauspicious because the very material mask is\ninauspicious. We simply imagine it to be auspicious. Real auspiciousness depends\non activities in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness in full devotion and service. Therefore if\nwe at all want our activities to he auspicious, then we should work under the\ndirections of the Supreme Lord. Such directions are given in authoritative\nscriptures such as \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam and Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, or from a bona fide\nspiritual master. Because the spiritual master is the representative of the\nSupreme Lord, his direction is directly the direction of the Supreme Lord. The\nspiritual master, saintly persons and scriptures direct in the same way. There\nis no contradiction in these three sources. All actions done under such\ndirection are free from the reactions of pious or impious activities of this\nmaterial world. The transcendental attitude of the devotee in the performance of\nactivities is actually that of renunciation, and this is called sanny\u0101sa. Anyone\nacting under the direction of the Supreme Lord is actually a sanny\u0101s\u012b and a\nyog\u012b, and not the man who has simply taken the dress of the sanny\u0101s\u012b, or a\npseudo-yog\u012b.",

TRANSLATION  Intelligence, knowledge, freedom from doubt and delusion, forgiveness,\ntruthfulness, self-control and calmness, pleasure and pain, birth, death, fear,\nfearlessness, nonviolence, equanimity, satisfaction, austerity, charity, fame\nand infamy are created by Me alone.  PURPORT  The different qualities of living entities, be they good or bad, are all created\nby K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and they are described here.  Intelligence refers to the power of analyzing things in proper perspective, and\nknowledge refers to understanding what is spirit and what is matter. Ordinary\nknowledge obtained by a university education pertains only to matter, and it is\nnot accepted here as knowledge. Knowledge means knowing the distinction between\nspirit and matter. In modern education there is no knowledge about the spirit;\nthey are simply taking care of the material elements and bodily needs. Therefore\nacademic knowledge is not complete.  Asa\u1e41moha\u1e25, freedom from doubt and delusion, can be achieved when one is not\nhesitant and when he understands the transcendental philosophy. Slowly but\nsurely he becomes free from bewilderment. Nothing should be accepted blindly;\neverything should be accepted with care and with caution. K\u1e63am\u0101, forgiveness,\nshould be practiced, and one should excuse the minor offenses of others. Satyam,\ntruthfulness, means that facts should be presented as they are for the benefit\nof others. Facts should not be misrepresented. According to social conventions,\nit is said that one can speak the truth only when it is palatable to others. But\nthat is not truthfulness. The truth should be spoken in a straight and forward\nway, so that others will understand actually what the facts are. If a man is a\nthief and if people are warned that he is a thief, that is truth. Although\nsometimes the truth is unpalatable, one should not refrain from speaking it.\nTruthfulness demands that the facts be presented as they are for the benefit of\nothers. That is the definition of truth.  Self-control means that the senses should not be used for unnecessary personal\nenjoyment. There is no prohibition against meeting the proper needs of the\nsenses, but unnecessary sense enjoyment is detrimental for spiritual\nadvancement. Therefore the senses should be restrained from unnecessary use.\nSimilarly, the mind should not indulge in unnecessary thoughts; that is called\n\u015bama\u1e25, or calmness. Nor should one spend one\u2019s time pondering over earning\nmoney. That is a misuse of the thinking power. The mind should be used to\nunderstand the prime necessity of human beings, and that should be presented\nauthoritatively. The power of thought should be developed in association with\npersons who are authorities in the scriptures, saintly persons and spiritual\nmasters and those whose thinking is highly developed. Sukham, pleasure or\nhappiness, should always be in that which is favorable for the cultivation of\nthe spiritual knowledge of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. And similarly, that which is\npainful or which causes distress is that which is unfavorable for the\ncultivation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Anything favorable for the development of\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness should be accepted, and anything unfavorable should be\nrejected.  Bhava, birth, should be understood to refer to the body. As far as the soul is\nconcerned, there is neither birth nor death; that we have discussed in the\nbeginning of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Birth and death apply to one\u2019s embodiment in the\nmaterial world. Fear is due to worrying about the future. A person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness has no fear because by his activities he is sure to go back to the\nspiritual sky, back home, back to Godhead. Therefore his future is very bright.\nOthers, however, do not know what their future holds; they have no knowledge of\nwhat the next life holds. So they are therefore in constant anxiety. If we want\nto get free from anxiety, then the best course is to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and be\nsituated always in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. In that way we will be free from all\nfear. In the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. it is stated that fear is caused by our\nabsorption in the illusory energy, but those who are free from the illusory\nenergy, those who are confident that they are not the material body, that they\nare spiritual parts of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and are therefore\nengaged in the transcendental service of the Supreme Godhead, have nothing to\nfear. Their future is very bright. This fear is a condition of persons who are\nnot in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Bhayam, fearlessness, is only possible for one in\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.  Ahi\u1e41s\u0101, nonviolence, means that one should not do anything which will put others\ninto misery or confusion. Material activities that are promised by so many\npoliticians, sociologists, philanthropists, etc., do not produce very good\nresults because the politicians and philanthropists have no transcendental\nvision; they do not know what is actually beneficial for human society. Ahi\u1e41s\u0101\nmeans that people should be trained in such a way that the full utilization of\nthe human body can be achieved. The human body is meant for spiritual\nrealization, so any movement or any commissions which do not further that end\ncommit violence on the human body. That which furthers the future spiritual\nhappiness of the people in general is called nonviolence.  Samat\u0101, equanimity, refers to freedom from attachment and aversion. To be very\nmuch attached or to be very much detached is not the best. This material world\nshould be accepted without attachment or aversion. Similarly, that which is\nfavorable for prosecuting K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness should be accepted; that which is\nunfavorable should be rejected. That is called samat\u0101, equanimity. A person in\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness has nothing to reject and nothing to accept unless it is\nuseful in the prosecution of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.  Tu\u1e63\u1e6di\u1e25, satisfaction, means that one should not be eager to gather more and more\nmaterial goods by unnecessary activity. One should be satisfied with whatever is\nobtained by the grace of the Supreme Lord; that is called satisfaction. Tapas\nmeans austerity or penance. There are many rules and definitions in the Vedas\nwhich apply here, like rising early in the morning and taking a bath. Sometimes\nit is very troublesome to rise early in the morning, but whatever voluntary\ntrouble one may suffer in this way is called penance. Similarly, there are\nprescriptions for fasting on certain days of the month. One may not be inclined\nto practice such fasting, but because of his determination to make advancement\nin the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, he should accept such bodily troubles\nwhich are recommended. However, one should not fast unnecessarily or against\nVedic injunctions. One should not fast for some political purpose; that is\ndescribed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 as fasting in ignorance, and anything done in\nignorance or passion does not lead to spiritual advancement. Everything done in\nthe mode of goodness does advance one, however, and fasting done in terms of the\nVedic injunctions enriches one in spiritual knowledge.  As far as charity is concerned, one should give fifty percent of his earnings to\nsome good cause. And what is a good cause? It is that which is conducted in\nterms of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. That is not only a good cause, but it is the best\ncause. Because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is good, His cause is also good. Thus charity should be\ngiven to a person who is engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. According to Vedic\nliterature, it is enjoined that charity should be given to the br\u0101hma\u1e47as. This\npractice is still followed, although not very nicely in terms of the Vedic\ninjunction. But still the injunction is that charity should be given to the\nbr\u0101hma\u1e47as. Why? Because they are engaged in higher cultivation of spiritual\nknowledge. A br\u0101hma\u1e47a is supposed to devote his whole life to understanding\nBrahman. A brahma-jana is one who knows Brahman; he is called a br\u0101hma\u1e47a. Thus\ncharity is offered to the br\u0101hma\u1e47as because since they are always engaged in\nhigher spiritual service, they have no time to earn their livelihood. In the\nVedic literature, charity is also to be awarded to the renouncer of life, the\nsanny\u0101s\u012b. The sanny\u0101s\u012bs beg from door to door, not for money but for missionary\npurposes. The system is that they go from door to door to awaken the\nhouseholders from the slumber of ignorance. Because the householders are engaged\nin family affairs and have forgotten their actual purpose in life\u2014awakening\ntheir K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness\u2014it is the business of the sanny\u0101s\u012bs to go as beggars\nto the householders and encourage them to be K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious. As it is said in\nthe Vedas, one should awake and achieve what is due him in this human form of\nlife. This knowledge and method is distributed by the sanny\u0101s\u012bs; hence charity\nis to be given to the renouncer of life, to the br\u0101hma\u1e47as, and similar good\ncauses, not to any whimsical cause.  Ya\u015ba\u1e25, fame, should be according to Lord Caitanya, who said that a man is famous\nwhen he is known as a great devotee. That is real fame. If one has become a\ngreat man in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and it is known, then he is truly famous. One\nwho does not have such fame is infamous.  All these qualities are manifest throughout the universe in human society and in\nthe society of the demigods. There are many forms of humanity on other planets,\nand these qualities are there. Now, for one who wants to advance in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a creates all these qualities, but the person develops them\nhimself from within. One who engages in the devotional service of the Supreme\nLord develops all the good qualities, as arranged by the Supreme Lord.  Of whatever we find, good or bad, the origin is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Nothing can manifest in\nthis material world which is not in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. That is knowledge; although we know\nthat things are differently situated, we should realize that everything flows\nfrom K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",

PURPORT  The Lord is giving a genealogical synopsis of the universal population. Brahm\u0101\nis the original creature born out of the energy of the Supreme Lord known as\nHira\u1e47yagarbha. And from Brahm\u0101 all the seven great sages, and before them four\nother great sages, named Sanaka, Sananda, San\u0101tana, and Sanatkum\u0101ra, and the\nManus, are manifest. All these twenty-five great sages are known as the\npatriarchs of the living entities all over the universe. There are innumerable\nuniverses and innumerable planets within each universe, and each planet is full\nof population of different varieties. All of them are born of these twenty-five\npatriarchs. Brahm\u0101 underwent penance for one thousand years of the demigods\nbefore he realized by the grace of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a how to create. Then from Brahm\u0101,\nSanaka, Sananda, San\u0101tana, and Sanatkum\u0101ra came out, then Rudra, and then the\nseven sages, and in this way all the br\u0101hma\u1e47as and k\u1e63atriyas are born out of the\nenergy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Brahm\u0101 is known as pit\u0101maha, the\ngrandfather, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is known as the prapit\u0101-maha, the father of the\ngrandfather.

PURPORT  The highest summit of spiritual perfection is knowledge of the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead. Unless one is firmly convinced of the different\nopulences of the Supreme Lord, he cannot engage in devotional service. Generally\npeople know that God is great, but they do not know in detail how God is great.\nHere are the details. If one knows factually how God is great, then naturally he\nbecomes a surrendered soul and engages himself in the devotional service of the\nLord. When one factually knows the opulences of the Supreme, there is no\nalternative but to surrender to Him. This factual knowledge can be known from\nthe descriptions in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam and Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and similar literatures.  In the administration of this universe there are many demigods distributed\nthroughout the planetary system, and the chief of them are Brahm\u0101, Lord \u015aiva and\nthe four great Kum\u0101ras and other patriarchs. There are many forefathers of the\npopulation of the universe, and all of them are born of the Supreme Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\nThe Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is the original forefather of all\nforefathers.  These are some of the opulences of the Supreme Lord. When one is firmly\nconvinced of them, he accepts K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a with great faith and without any doubt, and\nhe engages in devotional service. All this particular knowledge is required in\norder to increase one\u2019s interest in the loving devotional service of the Lord.\nOne should not neglect to understand fully how great K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is, for by knowing\nthe greatness of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a one will be able to be fixed in sincere devotional\nservice.",

In the Mok\u1e63a-dharma K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a also says,\npraj\u0101pati\u1e41 ca rudra\u1e41 c\u0101py aham eva s\u1e5bj\u0101mi vai tau hi m\u0101\u1e41 na vij\u0101n\u012bto mama\nm\u0101y\u0101-vimohitau. \u201cThe patriarchs, \u015aiva and others are created by Me, though they\ndo not know that they are created by Me because they are deluded by My illusory\nenergy.\u201d In Var\u0101ha Pur\u0101\u1e47a it is also said, n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a\u1e25 paro devas tasm\u0101j j\u0101ta\u015b\ncaturmukha\u1e25 tasm\u0101d rudro \u2019bhavad deva\u1e25 sa ca sarvaj\u00f1at\u0101\u1e41 gata\u1e25. \u201cN\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a is the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead, and from Him Brahm\u0101 was born, from whom \u015aiva was\nborn.\u201d  Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the source of all generations, and He is called the most efficient\ncause of everything. He says that because \u201ceverything is born of Me, I am the\noriginal source of all. Everything is under Me; no one is above Me.\u201d There is no\nsupreme controller other than K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. One who understands K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in such a way\nfrom a bona fide spiritual master and from Vedic literature, who engages all his\nenergy in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, becomes a truly learned man. In comparison to\nhim, all others, who do not know K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a properly, are but fools. Only a fool\nwould consider K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to be an ordinary man. A K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person should not\nbe bewildered by fools; he should avoid all unauthorized commentaries and\ninterpretations on Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and proceed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness with\ndetermination and firmness.",

TRANSLATION  The thoughts of My pure devotees dwell in Me, their lives are surrendered to Me,\nand they derive great satisfaction and bliss enlightening one another and\nconversing about Me.  PURPORT  Pure devotees, whose characteristics are mentioned here, engage themselves fully\nin the transcendental loving service of the Lord. Their minds cannot be diverted\nfrom the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Their talks are solely on the transcendental\nsubjects. The symptoms of the pure devotees are described in this verse\nspecifically. Devotees of the Supreme Lord are twenty-four hours daily engaged\nin glorifying the pastimes of the Supreme Lord. Their hearts and souls are\nconstantly submerged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and they take pleasure in discussing Him with\nother devotees.  In the preliminary stage of devotional service they relish the transcendental\npleasure from the service itself, and in the mature stage they are actually\nsituated in love of God. Once situated in that transcendental position, they can\nrelish the highest perfection which is exhibited by the Lord in His abode. Lord\nCaitanya likens transcendental devotional service to the sowing of a seed in the\nheart of the living entity. There are innumerable living entities traveling\nthroughout the different planets of the universe, and out of them there are a\nfew who are fortunate enough to meet a pure devotee and get the chance to\nunderstand devotional service. This devotional service is just like a seed, and\nif it is sown in the heart of a living entity, and if he goes on hearing and\nchanting, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma,\nR\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare, that seed fructifies, just as the seed of a tree\nfructifies with regular watering. The spiritual plant of devotional service\ngradually grows and grows until it penetrates the covering of the material\nuniverse and enters into the brahmajyoti effulgence in the spiritual sky. In the\nspiritual sky also that plant grows more and more until it reaches the highest\nplanet, which is called Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, the supreme planet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\nUltimately, the plant takes shelter under the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and rests\nthere. Gradually, as a plant grows fruits and flowers, that plant of devotional\nservice also produces fruits, and the watering process in the form of chanting\nand hearing goes on. This plant of devotional service is fully described in the\nCaitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta. It is explained there that when the complete plant takes\nshelter under the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord, one becomes fully absorbed in\nlove of God; then he cannot live even for a moment without being in contact with\nthe Supreme Lord, just as a fish cannot live without water. In such a state, the\ndevotee actually attains the transcendental qualities in contact with the\nSupreme Lord.  The \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam is also full of such narration about the relationship\nbetween the Supreme Lord and His devotees; therefore the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam is\nvery dear to the devotees. In this narration there is nothing about material\nactivities, sense gratification or liberation. \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam is the only\nnarration in which the transcendental nature of the Supreme Lord and His\ndevotees is fully described. Thus the realized souls in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness take\ncontinual pleasure in hearing such transcendental literatures, just as a young\nboy and girl take pleasure in association.",

TRANSLATION  To those who are constantly devoted and worship Me with love, I give the\nunderstanding by which they can come to Me.  PURPORT  In this verse the word buddhi-yogam is very significant. We may remember that in\nthe Second Chapter the Lord, instructing Arjuna, said that He had spoken to him\nof many things and that He would instruct him in the way of buddhi-yoga. Now\nbuddhi-yoga is explained. Buddhi-yogam itself is action in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness;\nthat is the highest intelligence. Buddhi means intelligence, and yogam means\nmystic activities or mystic elevation. When one tries to go back home, back to\nGodhead, and takes fully to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness in devotional service, his\naction is called buddhi-yogam. In other words, buddhi-yogam is the process by\nwhich one gets out of the entanglement of this material world. The ultimate goal\nof progress is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. People do not know this; therefore the association of\ndevotees and a bona fide spiritual master are important. One should know that\nthe goal is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and when the goal is assigned, then the path is slowly but\nprogressively traversed, and the ultimate goal is achieved.  When a person knows the goal of life but is addicted to the fruits of\nactivities, he is acting in karma-yoga. When he knows that the goal is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a,\nbut he takes pleasure in mental speculations to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he is acting\nin j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga. And when he knows the goal and seeks K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a completely in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness and devotional service, he is acting in bhakti-yoga, or\nbuddhi-yoga, which is the complete yoga. This complete yoga is the highest\nperfectional stage of life.  A person may have a bona fide spiritual master and may be attached to a\nspiritual organization, but still, if he is not intelligent enough to make\nprogress, then K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a from within gives him instructions so that he may\nultimately come to Him without difficulty. The qualification is that a person\nalways engage himself in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and with love and devotion render\nall kinds of services. He should perform some sort of work for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and that\nwork should be with love. If a devotee is intelligent enough, he will make\nprogress on the path of self-realization. If one is sincere and devoted to the\nactivities of devotional service, the Lord gives him a chance to make progress\nand ultimately attain to Him.",

TRANSLATION  Out of compassion for them, I, dwelling in their hearts, destroy with the\nshining lamp of knowledge the darkness born of ignorance.  PURPORT  When Lord Caitanya was in Benares promulgating the chanting of Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare,\nthousands of people were following Him. Prak\u0101\u015b\u0101nanda, a very influential and\nlearned scholar in Benares at that time, derided Lord Caitanya for being a\nsentimentalist. Sometimes philosophers criticize the devotees because they think\nthat most of the devotees are in the darkness of ignorance and are\nphilosophically naive sentimentalists. Actually that is not the fact. There are\nvery, very learned scholars who have put forward the philosophy of devotion, but\neven if a devotee does not take advantage of their literatures or of his\nspiritual master, if he is sincere in his devotional service he is helped by\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself within his heart. So the sincere devotee engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness cannot be without knowledge. The only qualification is that one\ncarry out devotional service in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.  The modern philosophers think that without discriminating one cannot have pure\nknowledge. For them this answer is given by the Supreme Lord: those who are\nengaged in pure devotional service, even though they be without sufficient\neducation and even without sufficient knowledge of the Vedic principles, are\nstill helped by the Supreme God, as stated in this verse.  The Lord tells Arjuna that basically there is no possibility of understanding\nthe Supreme Truth, the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead,\nsimply by speculating, for the Supreme Truth is so great that it is not possible\nto understand Him or to achieve Him simply by making a mental effort. Man can go\non speculating for several millions of years, and if he is not devoted, if he is\nnot a lover of the Supreme Truth, he will never understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or the Supreme\nTruth. Only by devotional service is the Supreme Truth, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, pleased, and by\nHis inconceivable energy He can reveal Himself to the heart of the pure devotee.\nThe pure devotee always has K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a within his heart; therefore he is just like\nthe sun that dissipates the darkness of ignorance. This is the special mercy\nrendered to the pure devotee by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.  Due to the contamination of material association, through many, many millions of\nbirths, one\u2019s heart is always covered with the dust of materialism, but when one\nengages in devotional service and constantly chants Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the dust quickly\nclears, and one is elevated to the platform of pure knowledge. The ultimate goal\nof Vi\u1e63\u1e47u can be attained only by this chant and by devotional service, and not\nby mental speculation or argument. The pure devotee does not have to worry about\nthe necessities of life; he need not be anxious because when he removes the\ndarkness from his heart, everything is provided automatically by the Supreme\nLord, for He is pleased by the loving devotional service of the devotee. This is\nthe essence of the G\u012bt\u0101\u2019s teachings. By studying Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, one can become a\ncompletely surrendered soul to the Supreme Lord and engage himself in pure\ndevotional service. As the Lord takes charge, one becomes completely free from\nall kinds of materialistic endeavors.",

TRANSLATION  Arjuna said: You are the Supreme Brahman, the ultimate, the supreme abode and\npurifier, the Absolute Truth and the eternal divine person. You are the primal\nGod, transcendental and original, and You are the unborn and all-pervading\nbeauty. All the great sages such as N\u0101rada, Asita, Devala, and Vy\u0101sa proclaim\nthis of You, and now You Yourself are declaring it to me.  PURPORT  In these two verses the Supreme Lord gives a chance to the modern philosopher,\nfor here it is clear that the Supreme is different from the individual soul.\nArjuna, after hearing the essential four verses of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 in this\nchapter, became completely free from all doubts and accepted K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead. He at once boldly declares, \u201cYou are\nParambrahma, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\u201d And previously K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a states\nthat He is the originator of everything and everyone. Every demigod and every\nhuman being is dependant on Him. Men and demigods, out of ignorance, think that\nthey are absolute and independant of the Supreme Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. That ignorance is\nremoved perfectly by the discharge of devotional service. This is already\nexplained in the previous verse by the Lord. Now by His grace, Arjuna is\naccepting Him as the Supreme Truth, in concordance with the Vedic injunction. It\nis not because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is an intimate friend of Arjuna that he is flattering Him\nby calling Him the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth. Whatever\nArjuna says in these two verses is confirmed by Vedic truth. Vedic injunctions\naffirm that only one who takes to devotional service to the Supreme Lord can\nunderstand Him, whereas others cannot. Each and every word of this verse spoken\nby Arjuna is confirmed by Vedic injunction.  In the Kena Upani\u1e63ad it is stated that the Supreme Brahman is the rest for\neverything, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has already explained that everything is resting on Him.\nThe Mu\u1e47\u1e0daka Upani\u1e63ad confirms that the Supreme Lord, in whom everything is\nresting, can be realized only by those who engage constantly in thinking of Him.\nThis constant thinking of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is smara\u1e47am, one of the methods of devotional\nservice. It is only by devotional service to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a that one can understand his\nposition and get rid of this material body.  In the Vedas the Supreme Lord is accepted as the purest of the pure. One who\nunderstands that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the purest of the pure can become purified from all\nsinful activities. One cannot be disinfected from sinful activities unless he\nsurrenders unto the Supreme Lord. Arjuna\u2019s acceptance of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the supreme\npure complies with the injunctions of Vedic literature. This is also confirmed\nby great personalities, of whom N\u0101rada is the chief.  K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and one should always meditate upon\nHim and enjoy one\u2019s transcendental relationship with Him. He is the supreme\nexistence. He is free from bodily needs, birth and death. Not only does Arjuna\nconfirm this, but all the Vedic literatures. the Pur\u0101\u1e47as and histories. In all\nVedic literatures K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is thus described, and the Supreme Lord Himself also\nsays in the Fourth Chapter, \u201cAlthough I am unborn, I appear on this earth to\nestablish religious principles.\u201d He is the supreme origin; He has no cause, for\nHe is the cause of all causes, and everything is emanating from Him. This\nperfect knowledge can be had by the grace of the Supreme Lord.  Here Arjuna expresses himself through the grace of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. If we want to\nunderstand Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, we should accept the statements in these two verses.\nThis is called the parampar\u0101 system, acceptance of the disciplic succession.\nUnless one is in the disciplic succession, he cannot understand Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.\nIt is not possible by so-called academic education. Unfortunately those proud of\ntheir academic education, despite so much evidence in Vedic literatures, stick\nto their obstinate conviction that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is an ordinary person.",

PURPORT  Arjuna herein confirms that persons of faithless and demonic nature cannot\nunderstand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He is not even known by the demigods, so what to speak of the\nso-called scholars of this modern world? By the grace of the Supreme Lord,\nArjuna has understood that the Supreme Truth is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and that He is the perfect\none. One should therefore follow the path of Arjuna. He received the authority\nof Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. As described in the Fourth Chapter, the parampar\u0101 system of\ndisciplic succession for the understanding of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 was lost, and\ntherefore K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a reestablished that disciplic succession with Arjuna because He\nconsidered Arjuna His intimate friend and a great devotee. Therefore, as stated\nin our Introduction to G\u012btopani\u1e63ad, Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 should be understood in the\nparampar\u0101 system. When the parampar\u0101 system was lost, Arjuna was again selected\nto rejuvenate it. The acceptance of Arjuna of all that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says should be\nemulated; then we can understand the essence of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, and then only can\nwe understand that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.",

TRANSLATION  Indeed, You alone know Yourself by Your own potencies, O origin of all, Lord of\nall beings, God of gods, O Supreme Person, Lord of the universe!  PURPORT  The Supreme Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can be known by persons who are in a relationship with\nHim through the discharge of devotional service, like Arjuna and his successors.\nPersons of demonic or atheistic mentality cannot know K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Mental speculation\nthat leads one away from the Supreme Lord is a serious sin, and one who does not\nknow K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a should not try to comment on Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is the\nstatement of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and since it is the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, it should be\nunderstood from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as Arjuna understood it. It should not be received from\natheistic persons.  The Supreme Truth is realized in three aspects: as impersonal Brahman, localized\nParam\u0101tm\u0101 and at last as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. So at the last\nstage of understanding the Absolute Truth, one comes to the Supreme Personality\nof Godhead. A liberated man and even a common man may realize impersonal Brahman\nor localized Param\u0101tm\u0101, yet they may not understand God\u2019s personality from the\nverses of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, which are being spoken by this person, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Sometimes\nthe impersonalists accept K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as Bhagavan, or they accept His authority. Yet\nmany liberated persons cannot understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as Puru\u1e63ottama, the Supreme\nPerson, the father of all living entities. Therefore Arjuna addresses Him as\nPuru\u1e63ottama. And if one comes to know Him as the father of all the living\nentities, still one may not know Him as the supreme controller; therefore He is\naddressed here as Bh\u016bte\u015ba, the supreme controller of everyone. And even if one\nknows K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the supreme controller of all living entities, still one may not\nknow that He is the origin of all the demigods; therefore He is addressed herein\nas Devadeva, the worshipful God of all demigods. And even if one knows Him as\nthe worshipful God of all demigods, one may not know that He is the supreme\nproprietor of everything; therefore He is addressed as Jagatpati. Thus the truth\nabout K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is established in this verse by the realization of Arjuna, and we\nshould follow in the footsteps of Arjuna to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as He is.",

TRANSLATION  How should I meditate on You? In what various forms are You to be contemplated,\nO Blessed Lord?  PURPORT  As it is stated in the previous chapter, the Supreme Personality of Godhead is\ncovered by His yoga-m\u0101y\u0101. Only surrendered souls and devotees can see Him. Now\nArjuna is convinced that His friend, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is the Supreme Godhead, but he wants\nto know the general process by which the all-pervading Lord can be understood by\nthe common man. No common man, including the demons and atheists, can know K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nbecause He is guarded by His yoga-m\u0101y\u0101 energy. Again, these questions are asked\nby Arjuna for their benefit. The superior devotee is not only concerned for his\nown understanding, but for the understanding of all mankind. Out of his mercy,\nbecause he is a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, a devotee, Arjuna is opening the understanding for the\ncommon man as far as the all-pervasiveness of the Supreme is concerned. He\naddresses K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a specifically as yogin because \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the master of the\nyoga-m\u0101y\u0101 energy by which He is covered and uncovered to the common man. The\ncommon man who has no love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a cannot always think of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; therefore he\nhas to think materially. Arjuna is considering the mode of thinking of the\nmaterialistic persons of this world. Because materialists cannot understand\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a spiritually, they are advised to concentrate the mind on physical things\nand try to see how K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is manifested by physical representations.",

PURPORT  A similar statement was made to S\u016bta Gosv\u0101m\u012b by the \u1e5b\u1e63is of Naimi\u1e63\u0101ra\u1e47ya, headed\nby \u015aaunaka.

Those who have entered into\na transcendental relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a relish in every step descriptions of\nthe pastimes of the Lord.\u201d Thus Arjuna is interested to hear about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a,\nspecifically how He remains as the all-pervading Supreme Lord.  Now as far as am\u1e5btam, nectar, is concerned, any narration or statement\nconcerning K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is just like nectar. And this nectar can be perceived by\npractical experience. Modern stories, fiction and histories are different from\nthe transcendental pastimes of the Lord in that one will tire of hearing mundane\nstories, but one never tires of hearing about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. It is for this reason only\nthat the history of the whole universe is replete with references to the\npastimes of the incarnations of Godhead. For instance, the Pur\u0101\u1e47as are histories\nof bygone ages that relate the pastimes of the various incarnations of the Lord.\nIn this way the reading matter remains forever fresh, despite repeated readings.",

TRANSLATION  The Blessed Lord said: Yes, I will tell you of My splendorous manifestations,\nbut only of those which are prominent, O Arjuna, for My opulence is limitless.  PURPORT  It is not possible to comprehend the greatness of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and His opulences. The\nsenses of the individual soul are imperfect and do not permit him to understand\nthe totality of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s affairs. Still the devotees try to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but\nnot on the principle that they will be able to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a fully at any\nspecific time or in any state of life. Rather, the very topics of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are so\nrelishable that they appear to them as nectar. Thus they enjoy them. In\ndiscussing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s opulences and His diverse energies, the pure devotees take\ntranscendental pleasure. Therefore they want to hear and discuss them. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nknows that living entities do not understand the extent of His opulences; He\ntherefore agrees to state only the principal manifestations of His different\nenergies. The word pr\u0101dh\u0101nyata\u1e25 (principal) is very important because we can\nunderstand only a few of the principal details of the Supreme Lord, for His\nfeatures are unlimited. It is not possible to understand them all. And vibh\u016bti,\nas used in this verse, refers to the opulences by which He controls the whole\nmanifestation. In the Amara-ko\u015ba dictionary it is stated that vibh\u016bti indicates\nan exceptional opulence.  The impersonalist or the pantheist cannot understand the exceptional opulences\nof the Supreme Lord nor the manifestations of His divine energy. Both in the\nmaterial world and in the spiritual world His energies are distributed in every\nvariety of manifestation. Now K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is describing what can be directly perceived\nby the common man; thus part of His variegated energy is described in this way.",

TRANSLATION  I am the Self, O Gu\u1e0d\u0101ke\u015ba, seated in the hearts of all creatures. I am the\nbeginning, the middle and the end of all beings.  PURPORT  In this verse Arjuna is addressed as Gu\u1e0d\u0101ke\u015ba, which means one who has conquered\nthe darkness of sleep. For those who are sleeping in the darkness of ignorance,\nit is not possible to understand how the Supreme Godhead manifests Himself in\nthe material and spiritual worlds. Thus this address by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to Arjuna is\nsignificant. Because Arjuna is above such darkness, the Personality of Godhead\nagrees to describe His various opulences.  K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a first informs Arjuna that He is the Self or soul of the entire cosmic\nmanifestation by dint of His primary expansion. Before the material creation,\nthe Supreme Lord, by His plenary expansion, accepts the Puru\u1e63a incarnations, and\nfrom Him everything begins. Therefore He is \u0101tm\u0101, the soul of the mahat-tattva,\nthe universal elements. The total material energy is not the cause of the\ncreation, but actually the Mah\u0101-Vis\u1e47u enters into the mahat-tattva, the total\nmaterial energy. He is the soul. When Mah\u0101-Vi\u1e63\u1e47u enters into the manifested\nuniverses, He again manifests Himself as the Supersoul in each and every entity.\nWe have experience that the personal body of the living entity exists due to the\npresence of the spiritual spark. Without the existence of the spiritual spark,\nthe body cannot develop. Similarly, the material manifestation cannot develop\nunless the Supreme Soul of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a enters.  The Supreme Personality of Godhead is existing as the Supersoul in all\nmanifested universes. A description of the three puru\u1e63a-avat\u0101ras is given in\n\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. \u201cThe Supreme Personality of Godhead manifests three features,\nas K\u0101ra\u1e47odaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vis\u1e47u, Garbhodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u and K\u1e63\u012brodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, in this\nmaterial manifestation.\u201d The Supreme Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the cause of all causes, lies\ndown in the cosmic ocean as Mah\u0101-Vi\u1e63\u1e47u or K\u0101ra\u1e47odaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, and therefore\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the beginning of this universe, the maintainer of the universal\nmanifestation, and the end of all the energy.",

TRANSLATION  Of letters I am the letter A, and among compounds I am the dual word. I am also\ninexhaustable time, and of creators I am Brahm\u0101, whose manifold faces turn\neverywhere.  PURPORT  Ak\u0101ra, the first letter of the Sanskrit alphabet, is the beginning of the Vedic\nliterature. Without ak\u0101ra, nothing can be sounded; therefore it is the beginning\nof sound. In Sanskrit there are also many compound words, of which the dual\nword, like R\u0101ma-k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is called dvandva\u1e25. For instance, R\u0101ma and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a have the\nsame rhythm and therefore are called dual.  Among all kinds of killers, time is the ultimate because time kills everything.\nTime is the representative of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a because in due course of time there will be\na great fire and everything will be annihilated.  Among the creators and living entities, Brahm\u0101 is the chief. The various Brahm\u0101s\nexhibit four, eight, sixteen, etc., heads accordingly, and they are the chief\ncreators in their respective universes. The Brahm\u0101s are representatives of\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",

PURPORT  As soon as a man is born, he dies at every moment. Thus death is devouring every\nliving entity at every moment, but the last stroke is called death itself. That\ndeath is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. All species of life undergo six basic changes. They are born,\nthey grow, they remain for some time, they reproduce, they dwindle and finally\nvanish. Of these changes, the first is deliverance from the womb, and that is\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The first generation is the beginning of all future activities.  The six opulences listed are considered to be feminine. If a woman possesses all\nof them or some of them she becomes glorious. Sanskrit is a perfect language and\nis therefore very glorious.

TRANSLATION  Of hymns I am the B\u1e5bhat-s\u0101ma sung to the Lord Indra, and of poetry I am the\nG\u0101yatr\u012b verse, sung daily by br\u0101hma\u1e47as. Of months I am November and December,\nand of seasons I am flower-bearing spring.  PURPORT  It has already been explained by the Lord that amongst all the Vedas, the\nS\u0101ma-veda is rich with beautiful songs played by the various demigods.  One of these songs is the B\u1e5bhat-s\u0101ma, which has an exquisite melody and is sung\nat midnight.  In Sanskrit, there are definite rules that regulate poetry; rhyme and meter are\nnot written whimsically, as in much modern poetry. Amongst the regulated poetry,\nthe G\u0101yatr\u012b mantra, which is chanted by the duly qualified br\u0101hma\u1e47as, is the\nmost prominent. The G\u0101yatr\u012b mantra is mentioned in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam.\nBecause the G\u0101yatr\u012b mantra is especially meant for God realization, it\nrepresents the Supreme Lord. This mantra is meant for spiritually advanced\npeople, and when one attains success in chanting it, he can enter into the\ntranscendental position of the Lord. One must first acquire the qualities of the\nperfectly situated person, the qualities of goodness according to the laws of\nmaterial nature, in order to chant the G\u0101yatr\u012b mantra. The G\u0101yatr\u012b mantra is\nvery important in Vedic civilization and is considered to be the sound\nincarnation of Brahman. Brahm\u0101 is its initiator, and it is passed down from him\nin disciplic succession.  The months of November and December are considered the best of all months\nbecause in India grains are collected from the fields at this time, and the\npeople become very happy. Of course spring is a season universally liked because\nit is neither too hot nor too cold, and the flowers and trees blossom and\nflourish. In spring there are also many ceremonies commemorating K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s\npastimes; therefore this is considered to be the most joyful of all seasons, and\nit is the representative of the Supreme Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",

Indeed, he is\nthe best of men and therefore represents K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Among the munis, or learned men\nconversant in Vedic knowledge, Vy\u0101sa is the greatest because he explained Vedic\nknowledge in many different ways for the understanding of the common mass of\npeople in this age of Kali. And Vy\u0101sa is also known as an incarnation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a;\ntherefore Vy\u0101sa also represents K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.

Among the kavis, U\u015ban\u0101 was the\nspiritual master of the demons; he was extremely intelligent, far-seeing,\npolitical and spiritual in every way.

If, however, one thoroughly studies the different descriptions of the\nopulences and expansions of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s energy, then one can understand without any\ndoubt the position of Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and can fix his mind in the worship of\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a without deviation. The Lord is all-pervading by the expansion of His\npartial representation, the Supersoul, who enters into everything that is. Pure\ndevotees, therefore, concentrate their minds in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness in full\ndevotional service; therefore they are always situated in the transcendental\nposition. Devotional service and worship of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are very clearly indicated in\nthis chapter in verses eight to eleven. That is the way of pure devotional\nservice. How one can attain the highest devotional perfection of association\nwith the Supreme Personality of Godhead has been thoroughly explained in this\nchapter.",

He is even the cause of\nthe Mah\u0101-Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, and from Him the material universes emanate. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not an\nincarnation; He is the source of all incarnations. That has been completely\nexplained in the last chapter.\n\n\nNow, as far as Arjuna is concerned, he says that his illusion is over. This\nmeans that Arjuna no longer thinks of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as a mere human being, as a friend\nof his, but as the source of everything. Arjuna is very enlightened and is glad\nthat he has a great friend like K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but now he is thinking that although he\nmay accept K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the source of everything, others may not. So in order to\nestablish K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s divinity for all, he is requesting K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in this chapter to\nshow His universal form. Actually when one sees the universal form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a one\nbecomes frightened, like Arjuna, but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is so kind that after showing it He\nconverts Himself again into His original form. Arjuna agrees to what K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says\nseveral times. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is speaking to him just for his benefit, and Arjuna\nacknowledges that all this is happening to him by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s grace. He is now\nconvinced that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the cause of all causes and is present in everyone\u2019s\nheart as the Supersoul.\n\n\n11.2\n\n\nbhav\u0101pyayau hi bh\u016bt\u0101n\u0101\u1e41\n\n\n\u015brutau vistara\u015bo may\u0101\n\n\ntvatta\u1e25 kamala-patr\u0101k\u1e63a\n\n\nm\u0101h\u0101tmyam api c\u0101vyayam\n\n\nbhava\u2014appearance; apyayau\u2014disappearance; hi\u2014certainly; bh\u016bt\u0101n\u0101m\u2014of all living\nentities; \u015brutau\u2014have heard; vistara\u015ba\u1e25\u2014detail; may\u0101\u2014by me; tvatta\u1e25\u2014from You;\nkamala-patr\u0101k\u1e63a\u2014O lotus-eyed one; m\u0101h\u0101tmyam\u2014glories; api\u2014also; ca\u2014and;\navyayam\u2014inexhaustible.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nO lotus-eyed one, I have heard from You in detail about the appearance and\ndisappearance of every living entity, as realized through Your inexhaustible\nglories.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nArjuna addresses Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as \u201clotus-eyed\u201d (K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s eyes appear just like the\npetals of a lotus flower) out of his joy, for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has assured him, in the last\nverse of the previous chapter, that He sustains the entire universe with just a\nfragment of Himself. He is the source of everything in this material\nmanifestation, and Arjuna has heard of this from the Lord in detail. Arjuna\nfurther knows that in spite of His being the source of all appearances and\ndisappearances, He is aloof from them. His personality is not lost, although He\nis all-pervading. That is the inconceivable opulence of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a which Arjuna\nadmits that he has thoroughly understood.\n\n\n11.3\n\n\nevam etad yath\u0101ttha tvam\n\n\n\u0101tm\u0101na\u1e41 parame\u015bvara\n\n\ndra\u1e63\u1e6dum icch\u0101mi te r\u016bpam\n\n\nai\u015bvara\u1e41 puru\u1e63ottama\n\n\nevam\u2014that; etat\u2014this; yath\u0101ttha\u2014as it is; tvam\u2014You; \u0101tm\u0101nam\u2014the soul;\nparame\u015bvara\u2014the Supreme Lord; dra\u1e63\u1e6dum\u2014to see; icch\u0101mi\u2014I wish; te\u2014You;\nr\u016bpam\u2014form; ai\u015bvaram\u2014divine; puru\u1e63ottama\u2014O best of personalities.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nO greatest of all personalities, O supreme form, though I see here before me\nYour actual position, I yet wish to see how You have entered into this cosmic\nmanifestation. I want to see that form of Yours.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe Lord said that because He entered into the material universe by His personal\nrepresentation, the cosmic manifestation has been made possible and is going on.\nNow as far as Arjuna is concerned, he is inspired by the statements of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a,\nbut in order to convince others in the future who may think that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is an\nordinary person, he desires to see Him actually in His universal form, to see\nhow He is acting from within the universe, although He is apart from it.\nArjuna\u2019s asking the Lord\u2019s permission is also significant. Since the Lord is the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead, He is present within Arjuna himself; therefore\nHe knows the desire of Arjuna, and He can understand that Arjuna has no special\ndesire to see Him in His universal form, for he is completely satisfied to see\nHim in His personal form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. But He can understand also that Arjuna wants\nto see the universal form to convince others. He did not have any personal\ndesire for confirmation. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a also understands that Arjuna wants to see the\nuniversal form to set a criterion, for in the future there would be so many\nimposters who would pose themselves as incarnations of God. The people,\ntherefore, should be careful; one who claims to be K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a should be prepared to\nshow his universal form to confirm his claim to the people.\n\n\n11.4\n\n\nmanyase yadi tac chakya\u1e41\n\n\nmay\u0101 dra\u1e63\u1e6dum iti prabho\n\n\nyoge\u015bvara tato me tva\u1e41\n\n\ndar\u015bay\u0101tm\u0101nam avyayam\n\n\nmanyase\u2014if You think; yadi\u2014if; tat\u2014that; \u015bakyam\u2014able to see; may\u0101\u2014by me;\ndra\u1e63\u1e6dum\u2014to see; iti\u2014thus; prabho\u2014O Lord; yoge\u015bvara\u2014the Lord of all mystic power;\ntata\u1e25\u2014then; me\u2014unto me; tvam\u2014You; dar\u015baya\u2014show; \u0101tm\u0101nam\u2014Yourself;\navyayam\u2014eternal.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nIf You think that I am able to behold Your cosmic form, O my Lord, O master of\nall mystic power, then kindly show me that universal self.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nIt is said that one can neither see, hear, understand nor perceive the Supreme\nLord, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, by the material senses. But if one is engaged in loving\ntranscendental service to the Lord from the beginning, then one can see the Lord\nby revelation. Every living entity is only a spiritual spark; therefore it is\nnot possible to see or to understand the Supreme Lord. Arjuna, as a devotee,\ndoes not depend on his speculative strength; rather, he admits his limitations\nas a living entity and acknowledges K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s inestimable position. Arjuna could\nunderstand that for a living entity it is not possible to understand the\nunlimited infinite. If the infinite reveals Himself, then it is possible to\nunderstand the nature of the infinite by the grace of the infinite. The word\nyoge\u015bvara is also very significant here because the Lord has inconceivable\npower. If He likes, He can reveal Himself by His grace, although He is\nunlimited. Therefore Arjuna pleads for the inconceivable grace of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He does\nnot give K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a orders. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not obliged to reveal Himself to anyone unless\none surrenders fully in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and engages in devotional service.\nThus it is not possible for persons who depend on the strength of their mental\nspeculations to see K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\n\n\n11.5\n\n\n\u015br\u012b-bhagav\u0101n uv\u0101ca\n\n\npa\u015bya me p\u0101rtha r\u016bp\u0101\u1e47i\n\n\n\u015bata\u015bo \u2019tha sahasra\u015ba\u1e25\n\n\nn\u0101n\u0101-vidh\u0101ni divy\u0101ni\n\n\nn\u0101n\u0101-var\u1e47\u0101k\u1e5bt\u012bni ca\n\n\n\u015br\u012b bhagav\u0101n uv\u0101ca\u2014the Supreme Personality of Godhead said; pa\u015bya\u2014just see;\nme\u2014Mine; p\u0101rtha\u2014O son of P\u1e5bth\u0101; r\u016bp\u0101\u1e47i\u2014forms; \u015bata\u015ba\u1e25\u2014hundreds; atha\u2014also;\nsahasra\u015ba\u1e25\u2014thousands; n\u0101n\u0101-vidh\u0101ni\u2014variegated; divy\u0101ni\u2014divine; n\u0101n\u0101\u2014variegated;\nvar\u1e47a\u2014colored; ak\u1e5bt\u012bni\u2014forms; ca\u2014also.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThe Blessed Lord said: My dear Arjuna, O son of P\u1e5bth\u0101, behold now My opulences,\nhundreds of thousands of varied divine forms, multicolored like the sea.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nArjuna wanted to see K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in His universal form, which, although a\ntranscendental form, is just manifested for the cosmic manifestation and is\ntherefore subject to the temporary time of this material nature. As the material\nnature is manifested and not manifested, similarly this universal form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nis manifested and unmanifested. It is not eternally situated in the spiritual\nsky like K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s other forms. As far as a devotee is concerned, he is not eager\nto see the universal form, but because Arjuna wanted to see K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in this way,\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a reveals this form. This universal form is not possible to be seen by any\nordinary man.

To see the universal form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Arjuna is told not to\nchange his mind but his vision. The universal form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not very\nimportant; that will be clear in the verses. Yet because Arjuna wanted to see\nit, the Lord gives him the particular vision required to see that universal\nform.\n\n\nDevotees who are correctly situated in a transcendental relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nare attracted by loving features, not by a godless display of opulences. The\nplaymates of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the friends of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and the parents of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a never want\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to show His opulences. They are so immersed in pure love that they do not\neven know that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In their loving\nexchange they forget that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Lord. In the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam it\nis stated that the boys who play with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are all highly pious souls, and\nafter many, many births they are able to play with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Such boys do not know\nthat K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. They take Him as a personal\nfriend. The Supreme Person is considered as the impersonal Brahman by great\nsages, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead by the devotees, and as a product\nof this material nature by ordinary men. The fact is that the devotee is not\nconcerned to see the vi\u015bva-r\u016bpa, the universal form, but Arjuna wanted to see it\nto substantiate K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s statement so that in the future people could understand\nthat K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a not only theoretically or philosophically presented Himself as the\nSupreme but actually presented Himself as such to Arjuna. Arjuna must confirm\nthis because Arjuna is the beginning of the parampar\u0101 system. Those who are\nactually interested to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and\nwho follow in the footsteps of Arjuna should understand that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a not only\ntheoretically presented Himself as the Supreme, but actually revealed Himself as\nthe Supreme.\n\n\nThe Lord gave Arjuna the necessary power to see His universal form because He\nknew that Arjuna did not particularly want to see it, as we have already\nexplained.\n\n\n11.9\n\n\nsa\u00f1jaya uv\u0101ca\n\n\nevam uktv\u0101 tato r\u0101jan\n\n\nmah\u0101-yoge\u015bvaro hari\u1e25\n\n\ndar\u015bay\u0101m \u0101sa p\u0101rth\u0101ya\n\n\nparama\u1e41 r\u016bpam ai\u015bvaram\n\n\nsa\u00f1jaya\u1e25 uv\u0101ca\u2014Sanjaya said; evam\u2014thus; uktv\u0101\u2014saying; tata\u1e25\u2014thereafter; r\u0101jan\u2014O\nKing; mah\u0101-yoge\u015bvara\u1e25\u2014the most powerful mystic; hari\u1e25\u2014the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; dar\u015bay\u0101m\u0101sa\u2014showed; p\u0101rth\u0101ya\u2014unto Arjuna; paramam\u2014divine;\nr\u016bpam\u2014universal form; ai\u015bvaram\u2014opulences.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nSa\u00f1jaya said: O King, speaking thus, the Supreme, the Lord of all mystic power,\nthe Personality of Godhead, displayed His universal form to Arjuna.\n\n\n11.10-11\n\n\naneka-vaktra-nayanam\n\n\nanek\u0101dbhuta-dar\u015banam\n\n\naneka-divy\u0101bhara\u1e47a\u1e41\n\n\ndivy\u0101nekodyat\u0101yudham\n\n\ndivya-m\u0101ly\u0101mbara-dhara\u1e41\n\n\ndivya-gandh\u0101nulepanam\n\n\nsarv\u0101\u015bcarya-maya\u1e41 devam\n\n\nananta\u1e41 vi\u015bvato-mukham\n\n\naneka\u2014various; vaktra\u2014mouths; nayanam\u2014eyes; aneka\u2014various; adbhuta\u2014wonderful;\ndar\u015banam\u2014sight; aneka\u2014many; divya\u2014divine; \u0101bhara\u1e47am\u2014ornaments; divya\u2014divine;\naneka\u2014various; udyata\u2014uplifted; \u0101yudham weapons; divya\u2014divine; m\u0101lya\u2014garlands;\nambara-dharam\u2014covered with the dresses; divya\u2014divine; gandha\u2014fragrance;\nanulepanam\u2014smeared; sarva\u2014all; a\u015bcaryamayam\u2014wonderful; devam\u2014shining;\nanantam\u2014unlimited; vi\u015bvata\u1e25-mukham\u2014all-pervading.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nArjuna saw in that universal form unlimited mouths and unlimited eyes.

As we\nlearn from Vedic scriptures, there are many universes and many planets. Some of\nthem are made of earth, some are made of gold, some are made of jewels, some are\nvery great, some are not so great, etc. Sitting on his chariot, Arjuna could see\nall these universes.

Before, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Arjuna had a relationship based on\nfriendship, but here, after the revelation, Arjuna is offering obeisances with\ngreat respect, and with folded hands he is praying to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He is praising the\nuniversal form. Thus Arjuna\u2019s relationship becomes one of wonder rather than\nfriendship. Great devotees see K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the reservoir of all relationships. In\nthe scriptures there are twelve basic kinds of relationships mentioned, and all\nof them are present in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. It is said that He is the ocean of all the\nrelationships exchanged between two living entities, between the gods, or\nbetween the Supreme Lord and His devotees.\n\n\nIt is said that Arjuna was inspired by the relationship of wonder, and in that\nwonder, although he was by nature very sober, calm and quiet, he became\necstatic, his hair stood up, and he began to offer his obeisances unto the\nSupreme Lord with folded hands. He was not, of course, afraid. He was affected\nby the wonders of the Supreme Lord. The immediate context is wonder; his natural\nloving friendship was overwhelmed by wonder, and thus he reacted in this way.\n\n\n11.15\n\n\narjuna uv\u0101ca\n\n\npa\u015by\u0101mi dev\u0101\u1e41s tava deva dehe\n\n\nsarv\u0101\u1e41s tath\u0101 bh\u016bta-vi\u015be\u1e63a-sa\u1e45gh\u0101n\n\n\nbrahm\u0101\u1e47am \u012b\u015ba\u1e41 kamal\u0101sana-stham\n\n\n\u1e5b\u1e63\u012b\u1e41\u015b ca sarv\u0101n urag\u0101\u1e41\u015b ca divy\u0101n\n\n\narjuna\u1e25 uv\u0101ca\u2014Arjuna said; pa\u015by\u0101mi\u2014I see; dev\u0101n\u2014all the demigods; tava\u2014Your;\ndeva\u2014O Lord; dehe\u2014in the body; sarv\u0101n\u2014all; tath\u0101\u2014also; bh\u016bta\u2014living entities;\nvi\u015be\u1e63a-sa\u1e45gh\u0101n\u2014specifically assembled; brahm\u0101\u1e47am\u2014Lord Brahm\u0101; \u012b\u015bam\u2014Lord \u015aiva;\nkamala-\u0101sana-stham\u2014sitting on the lotus flower; \u1e5b\u1e63\u012bn\u2014great sages; ca\u2014also;\nsarv\u0101n\u2014all; urag\u0101n\u2014serpents; ca\u2014also; divy\u0101n\u2014divine.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nArjuna said: My dear Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, I see assembled together in Your body all the\ndemigods and various other living entities.

In reply, the Lord is saying that even if he\ndid not fight, every one of them would be destroyed, for that is His plan. If he\nstopped fighting, they would die in another way. Death cannot be checked, even\nif he did not fight. In fact, they were already dead. Time is destruction, and\nall manifestations are to be vanquished by the desire of the Supreme Lord.

This word is also very\nsignificant. The whole world is moving according to the plan of the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead. Foolish persons who do not have sufficient knowledge\nthink that nature is moving without a plan and all manifestations are but\naccidental formations. There are many so-called scientists who suggest that\nperhaps it was like this, or maybe like that, but there is no question of\n\u201cperhaps\u201d and \u201cmaybe.\u201d There is a specific plan being carried out in this\nmaterial world. What is this plan? This cosmic manifestation is a chance for the\nconditioned souls to go back to Godhead, back to home. As long they have the\ndomineering mentality which makes them try to lord it over material nature, they\nare conditioned. But anyone who can understand the plan of the Supreme Lord and\ncultivate K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is most intelligent. The creation and destruction\nof the cosmic manifestation are under the superior guidance of God. Thus the\nBattle of Kuruk\u1e63etra was fought according to the plan of God. Arjuna was\nrefusing to fight, but he was told that he should fight and at the same time\ndesire the Supreme Lord. Then he would be happy. If one is in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness and if his life is devoted to His transcendental service, he is\nperfect.\n\n\n11.34\n\n\ndro\u1e47a\u1e41 ca bh\u012b\u1e63ma\u1e41 ca jayadratha\u1e41 ca\n\n\nkar\u1e47a\u1e41 tath\u0101ny\u0101n api yodha-v\u012br\u0101n\n\n\nmay\u0101 hat\u0101\u1e41s tva\u1e41 jahi m\u0101 vyathi\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101\n\n\nyudhyasva jet\u0101si ra\u1e47e sapatn\u0101n\n\n\ndro\u1e47am ca\u2014also Dro\u1e47a; bh\u012b\u1e63mam ca\u2014also Bh\u012b\u1e63ma; jayadratham ca\u2014also Jayadratha;\nkar\u1e47am\u2014also Kar\u1e47a; tath\u0101\u2014also; any\u0101n\u2014others; api\u2014certainly; yodha-v\u012br\u0101n\u2014great\nwarriors; may\u0101\u2014by Me; hat\u0101n\u2014already killed; tvam\u2014you; jahi\u2014become victorious;\nm\u0101\u2014never; vyathi\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101\u1e25\u2014be disturbed; yudhyasva\u2014just fight; jet\u0101si\u2014just conquer;\nra\u1e47e\u2014in the fight; sapatn\u0101n\u2014enemies.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThe Blessed Lord said: All the great warriors\u2014Dro\u1e47a, Bh\u012b\u1e63ma, Jayadratha,\nKar\u1e47a\u2014are already destroyed.

He admitted that everything\ndone by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is quite fit. Arjuna confirmed that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the maintainer and\nthe object of worship for the devotees and the destroyer of the undesirables.\nHis actions are equally good for all. Arjuna understood herein that when the\nBattle of Kuruk\u1e63etra was being concluded, in outer space there were present many\ndemigods, siddhas, and the intelligentia of the higher planets, and they were\nobserving the fight because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was present there. When Arjuna saw the\nuniversal form of the Lord, the demigods took pleasure in it, but others, who\nwere demons and atheists, could not stand it when the Lord was praised. Out of\ntheir natural fear of the devastating form of the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead, they fled. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s treatment of the devotees and the atheists is\npraised by Arjuna.

O refuge of the\nuniverse, You are the invincible source, the cause of all causes, transcendental\nto this material manifestation.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nBy this offering of obeisances, Arjuna indicates that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is worshipable by\neveryone. He is all-pervading, and He is the Soul of every soul. Arjuna is\naddressing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as mah\u0101tm\u0101, which means that He is most magnanimous and\nunlimited. Ananta indicates that there is nothing which is not covered by the\ninfluence and energy of the Supreme Lord, and deve\u015ba means that He is the\ncontroller of all demigods and is above them all. He is the center of the whole\nuniverse. Arjuna also thought that it was fitting that all the perfect living\nentities and all powerful demigods offer their respectful obeisances unto Him\nbecause no one is greater than Him. He especially mentions that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is greater\nthan Brahm\u0101 because Brahm\u0101 is created by Him. Brahm\u0101 is born out of the lotus\nstem grown from the navel abdomen of Garbhodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, who is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s\nplenary expansion; therefore Brahm\u0101 and Lord \u015aiva, who is born of Brahm\u0101, and\nall other demigods must offer their respectful obeisances. Thus the Lord is\nrespected by Lord \u015aiva and Brahm\u0101 and similar other demigods. The word ak\u1e63aram\nis very significant because this material creation is subject to destruction,\nbut the Lord is above this material creation. He is the cause of all causes, and\nbeing so, He is superior to all the conditioned souls within this material\nnature as well as the material cosmic manifestation itself. He is therefore the\nall-great Supreme.\n\n\n11.38\n\n\ntvam \u0101di-deva\u1e25 puru\u1e63a\u1e25 pur\u0101\u1e47as\n\n\ntvam asya vi\u015bvasya para\u1e41 nidh\u0101nam\n\n\nvett\u0101si vedya\u1e41 ca para\u1e41 ca dh\u0101ma\n\n\ntvay\u0101 tata\u1e41 vi\u015bvam ananta-r\u016bpa\n\n\ntvam\u2014You; \u0101di-deva\u1e25\u2014the original Supreme God; puru\u1e63a\u1e25\u2014personality; pur\u0101\u1e47a\u1e25\u2014old;\ntvam\u2014You; asya\u2014this; vi\u015bvasya\u2014universe; param\u2014transcendental; nidh\u0101nam\u2014refuge;\nvett\u0101\u2014knower; asi\u2014You are; vedyam ca\u2014and the knowable; param ca\u2014and\ntranscendental; dh\u0101ma\u2014refuge; tvay\u0101\u2014by You; tatam\u2014pervaded; vi\u015bvam\u2014universe;\nananta-r\u016bpa\u2014unlimited form.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nYou are the original Personality, the Godhead.

He is admitting that formerly he did not know that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a could\nassume such a universal form, although He explained it as his intimate friend.\nArjuna did not know how many times he may have dishonored Him by addressing Him\nas \u201cO my friend, O K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, O Y\u0101dava,\u201d etc., without acknowledging His opulence.\nBut K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is so kind and merciful that in spite of such opulence He played with\nArjuna as a friend. Such is the transcendental loving reciprocation between the\ndevotee and the Lord. The relationship between the living entity and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is\nfixed eternally; it cannot be forgotten, as we can see from the behavior of\nArjuna.

He is the\nspiritual master because He originally gave the Vedic instructions to Brahm\u0101,\nand presently He is also instructing Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 to Arjuna; therefore He is\nthe original spiritual master, and any bona fide spiritual master at the present\nmoment must be a descendant in the line of disciplic succession stemming from\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Without being a representative of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one cannot become a teacher or\nspiritual master of transcendental subject matter.\n\n\nThe Lord is being paid obeisances in all respects. He is of immeasurable\ngreatness.

Everyone is below Him. No one can excel Him.\n\n\nThe Supreme Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has senses and a body like the ordinary man, but for Him\nthere is no difference between His senses, body, mind and Himself. Foolish\npersons who do not know Him perfectly say that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is different from His soul,\nmind, heart and everything else. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is absolute; therefore His activities and\npotencies are supreme. It is also stated that He does not have senses like ours.\nHe can perform all sensual activities; therefore His senses are neither\nimperfect nor limited. No one can be greater than Him, no one can be equal to\nHim, and everyone is lower than Him.\n\n\nWhoever knows His transcendental body, activities and perfection, after quitting\nhis body, returns to Him and doesn\u2019t come back again to this miserable world.\nTherefore one should know that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s activities are different from others. The\nbest policy is to follow the principles of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; that will make one perfect. It\nis also stated that there is no one who is master of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; everyone is His\nservant. Only K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is God, and everyone is servant. Everyone is complying with\nHis order. There is no one who can deny His order. Everyone is acting according\nto His direction, being under His superintendence.

But at the same time, after seeing that\nuniversal form, he is afraid that he has committed so many offenses to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a out\nof his unalloyed friendship. Thus his mind is disturbed out of fear, although he\nhad no reason to fear. Arjuna therefore is asking K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to show His N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a\nform because He can assume any form. This universal form is material and\ntemporary, as the material world is temporary. But in the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets He\nhas His transcendental form with four hands as N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. There are innumerable\nplanets in the spiritual sky, and in each of them K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is present by His\nplenary manifestations of different names. Thus Arjuna desired to see one of the\nforms manifest in the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets. Of course in each Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planet the\nform of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a is four-handed, and the four hands hold different symbols, the\nconchshell, mace, lotus and disc. According to the different hands these four\nthings are held in, the N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47as are named.

This form was glaring like the sun, and its many faces were\nrapidly changing. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a showed this form just to satisfy the desire of His\nfriend Arjuna. This form was manifested by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a through His internal potency,\nwhich is inconceivable by human speculation. No one had seen this universal form\nof the Lord before Arjuna, but because the form was shown to Arjuna, other\ndevotees in the heavenly planets and in other planets in outer space could also\nsee it. They did not see it before, but because of Arjuna they were also able to\nsee it. In other words, all the disciplic devotees of the Lord could see the\nuniversal form which was shown to Arjuna by the mercy of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Someone\ncommented that this form was shown to Duryodhana also when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a went to\nDuryodhana to negotiate for peace. Unfortunately, Duryodhana did not accept the\npeace offer, but at that time K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a manifested some of His universal forms. But\nthose forms are different from this one shown to Arjuna.

Only you have seen this.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe divine vision in this connection should be clearly understood. Who can have\ndivine vision? Divine means godly. Unless one attains the status of divinity as\na demigod, he cannot have divine vision. And what is a demigod? It is stated in\nthe Vedic scriptures that those who are devotees of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u are demigods.\nThose who are atheistic, i.e., who do not believe in Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, or who only\nrecognize the impersonal part of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the Supreme, cannot have the divine\nvision. It is not possible to decry K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and at the same time have the divine\nvision. One cannot have the divine vision without becoming divine. In other\nwords, those who have divine vision can also see like Arjuna.\n\n\nThe Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 gives the description of the universal form, and this\ndescription was unknown to everyone before Arjuna. Now one can have some idea of\nthe vi\u015bva-r\u016bpa after this incidence; those who are actually divine can see the\nuniversal form of the Lord. But one cannot be divine without being a pure\ndevotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The devotees, however, who are actually in the divine nature\nand who have divine vision, are not very much interested to see the universal\nform of the Lord. As described in the previous verse, Arjuna desired to see the\nfour-handed form of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, and he was actually afraid of the\nuniversal form.\n\n\nIn this verse there are some significant words, just like veda-yaj\u00f1\u0101dhya-yanai\u1e25,\nwhich refers to studying Vedic literature and the subject matter of sacrificial\nregulations. Veda refers to all kinds of Vedic literature, namely the four Vedas\n(\u1e5ak, Yajus, S\u0101ma and Atharva) and the eighteen Pur\u0101\u1e47as and Upani\u1e63ads, and\nVed\u0101nta-s\u016btra. One can study these at home or anywhere else. Similarly, there\nare s\u016btras, Kalpa-s\u016btras and M\u012bm\u0101\u1e41s\u0101-s\u016btras, for studying the method of\nsacrifice. D\u0101nai\u1e25 refers to charity which is offered to a suitable party. such\nas those who are engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, the\nbr\u0101hma\u1e47as and the Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas. Similarly, pious activities refer to the\nagni-hotra, etc., the prescribed duties of the different castes. Pious\nactivities and the voluntary acceptance of some bodily pains are called tapasya.\nSo one can perform all these, can accept bodily penances, give charity, study\nthe Vedas, etc., but unless he is a devotee like Arjuna, it is not possible to\nsee that universal form. Those who are impersonalists are also imagining that\nthey are seeing the universal form of the Lord, but from Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 we\nunderstand that the impersonalists are not devotees. Therefore they are unable\nto see the universal form of the Lord.\n\n\nThere are many persons who create incarnations. They falsely claim an ordinary\nhuman to be an incarnation, but this is all foolishness. We should follow the\nprinciples of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, otherwise there is no possibility of attaining\nperfect spiritual knowledge. Although Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is considered the\npreliminary study of the science of God, still it is so perfect that one can\ndistinguish what is what. The followers of a pseudo incarnation may say that\nthey have also seen the transcendental incarnation of God, the universal form,\nbut that is not acceptable because it is clearly stated here that unless one\nbecomes a devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one cannot see the universal form of God. So one\nfirst of all has to become a pure devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; then he can claim that he\ncan show the universal form of what he has seen. A devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a cannot\naccept false incarnations or followers of false incarnations.\n\n\n11.49\n\n\nm\u0101 te vyath\u0101 m\u0101 ca vim\u016b\u1e0dha-bh\u0101vo\n\n\nd\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dv\u0101 r\u016bpa\u1e41 ghoram \u012bd\u1e5b\u1e45 mamedam\n\n\nvyapeta-bh\u012b\u1e25 pr\u012bta-man\u0101\u1e25 punas tva\u1e41\n\n\ntad eva me r\u016bpam ida\u1e41 prapa\u015bya\n\n\nm\u0101\u2014let it not be; te\u2014unto you; vyath\u0101\u2014trouble; m\u0101\u2014let it not be; ca\u2014also;\nvim\u016b\u1e0dha-bh\u0101va\u1e25\u2014bewilderment; d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dv\u0101\u2014by seeing; r\u016bpam\u2014form; ghoram\u2014horrible;\n\u012bd\u1e5bk\u2014like this; mama\u2014My; idam\u2014as it is; vyapetabh\u012b\u1e25\u2014just become free from all\nfear; pr\u012bta-man\u0101\u1e25\u2014be pleased in mind; puna\u1e25\u2014again; tvam\u2014you; tat\u2014that; eva\u2014thus;\nme\u2014My; r\u016bpam\u2014form; idam\u2014this; prapa\u015bya\u2014just see.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nYour mind has been perturbed upon seeing this horrible feature of Mine.

But K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a said that he need not\nbe afraid of killing his grandfather. When they tried to disrobe Draupad\u012b in the\nassembly, Bh\u012b\u1e63ma and Dro\u1e47a were silent, and for such negligence of duty they\nshould be killed. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a showed His universal form to Arjuna just to show him\nthat these people were already killed for their unlawful action. That scene was\nshown to Arjuna because devotees are always peaceful, and they cannot perform\nsuch horrible actions. The purpose of the revelation of the universal form was\nshown; now Arjuna wanted to see the four-armed form, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a showed him. A\ndevotee is not much interested in the universal form, for it does not enable one\nto reciprocate loving feelings. A devotee wants to offer his respectful\nworshiping feelings; thus he wants to see the two-handed or four-handed K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nform so he can reciprocate in loving service with the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead.\n\n\n11.50\n\n\nsa\u00f1jaya uv\u0101ca\n\n\nity arjuna\u1e41 v\u0101sudevas tathoktv\u0101\n\n\nsvaka\u1e41 r\u016bpa\u1e41 dar\u015bay\u0101m \u0101sa bh\u016bya\u1e25\n\n\n\u0101\u015bv\u0101say\u0101m \u0101sa ca bh\u012btam ena\u1e41\n\n\nbh\u016btv\u0101 puna\u1e25 saumya-vapur mah\u0101tm\u0101\n\n\nsa\u00f1jaya\u1e25 uv\u0101ca\u2014Sa\u00f1jaya said; iti\u2014thus; arjunam\u2014unto Arjuna; v\u0101sudeva\u1e25\u2014K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a;\ntath\u0101\u2014that way; uktv\u0101\u2014saying; svakam\u2014His own; r\u016bpam\u2014form; dar\u015bay\u0101m\u0101sa\u2014showed;\nbh\u016bya\u1e25\u2014again; \u0101\u015bv\u0101say\u0101m\u0101sa\u2014also convinced him; ca\u2014also; bh\u012btam\u2014fearful;\nenam\u2014him; bh\u016btv\u0101 puna\u1e25\u2014becoming again; saumya-vapu\u1e25\u2014beautiful form; mah\u0101tm\u0101\u2014the\ngreat one.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nSa\u00f1jaya said to Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra: The Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, while\nspeaking thus to Arjuna, displayed His real four-armed form, and at last He\nshowed him His two-armed form, thus encouraging the fearful Arjuna.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nWhen K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a appeared as the son of Vasudeva and Devak\u012b, He first of all appeared\nas four-armed N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, but when He was requested by His parents, He transformed\nHimself into an ordinary child in appearance. Similarly, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a knew that Arjuna\nwas not interested in seeing a four-handed form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but since he asked to\nsee this four-handed form, He also showed him this form again and then showed\nHimself in His two-handed form. The word saumya-vapu\u1e25 is very significant.\nSaumya-vapu is a very beautiful form; it is known as the most beautiful form.\nWhen He was present, everyone was attracted simply by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s form, and because\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is director of the universe, He just banished the fear of Arjuna, His\ndevotee, and showed him again His beautiful form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.

Those who deride K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to be an ordinary person are\nshown here to be ignorant of His divine nature. If K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is like an ordinary\nhuman being, then how is it possible for Him to show the universal form and\nagain to show the four-handed N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a form? So it is very clearly stated in\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that one who thinks that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is an ordinary person and misguides\nthe reader by claiming that it is the impersonal Brahman within K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a speaking,\nis doing the greatest injustice. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has actually shown His universal form and\nHis fourhanded Vi\u1e63\u1e47u form. So how can He be an ordinary human being?

Even the demigods are ever seeking the opportunity to see\nthis form which is so dear.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nIn the forty-eighth verse of this chapter Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a concluded revealing His\nuniversal form and informed Arjuna that this form is not possible to be seen by\nso many activities, sacrifices, etc. Now here the word sudurdar\u015bam is used,\nindicating that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s two-handed form is still more confidential. One may be\nable to see the universal form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by adding a little tinge of devotional\nservice to various activities like penance, Vedic study and philosophical\nspeculation, etc. It may be possible, but without a tinge of bhakti, one cannot\nsee; that has already been explained. Still, beyond that universal form, the\nform of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as a two-handed man is still more difficult to see, even for\ndemigods like Brahm\u0101 and Lord \u015aiva. They desire to see Him, and we have\nevidences in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam that when He was supposed to be in the womb\nof His mother, Devak\u012b, all the demigods from heaven came to see the marvel of\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. They even waited to see Him. A foolish person may deride Him, but that is\nan ordinary person. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is actually desired to be seen by demigods like Brahm\u0101\nand \u015aiva in His two-armed form.\n\n\nIn Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 it is also confirmed that He is not visible to the foolish\npersons who deride Him. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s body, as confirmed by Brahm\u0101-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 and\nconfirmed by Himself in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, is completely spiritual and full of bliss\nand eternality. His body is never like a material body. But for some who make a\nstudy of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by reading Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 or similar Vedic scriptures, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is a\nproblem. For one using a material process, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is considered to be a great\nhistorical personality and very learned philosopher. But He isn\u2019t an ordinary\nman. But some think that even though He was so powerful, He had to accept a\nmaterial body. Ultimately they think that the Absolute Truth is impersonal;\ntherefore they think that from His impersonal feature He assumed a personal\nfeature attached to material nature. This is a materialistic calculation of the\nSupreme Lord. Another calculation is speculative. Those who are in search of\nknowledge also speculate on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and consider Him to be less important than the\nuniversal form of the Supreme. Thus some think that the universal form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nwhich was manifested to Arjuna is more important than His personal form.\nAccording to them, the personal form of the Supreme is something imaginary. They\nbelieve that in the ultimate issue, the Absolute Truth is not a person. But the\ntranscendental process is described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, Chapter Two: to hear about\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a from authorities. That is the actual Vedic process, and those who are\nactually in the Vedic line hear about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a from authority, and by repeated\nhearing about Him, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a becomes dear. As we have several times discussed, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nis covered by His yoga-m\u0101y\u0101 potency. He is not to be seen or revealed to anyone\nand everyone. Only by one to whom He reveals Himself can He be seen. This is\nconfirmed in Vedic literature; for one who is a surrendered soul, the Absolute\nTruth can actually be understood. The transcendentalist, by continuous K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness and by devotional service to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, can have his spiritual eyes\nopened and can see K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by revelation. Such a revelation is not possible even\nfor the demigods; therefore it is difficult even for the demigods to understand\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and the advanced demigods are always in hope of seeing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in His\ntwo-handed form. The conclusion is that although to see the universal form of\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is very, very difficult and not possible for anyone and everyone, it is\nstill more difficult to understand His personal form as \u015ay\u0101masundara.\n\n\n11.53\n\n\nn\u0101ha\u1e41 vedair na tapas\u0101\n\n\nna d\u0101nena na cejyay\u0101\n\n\n\u015bakya eva\u1e41-vidho dra\u1e63\u1e6du\u1e41\n\n\nd\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dav\u0101n asi m\u0101\u1e41 yath\u0101\n\n\nna\u2014never; aham\u2014I; vedai\u1e25\u2014by study of the Vedas; na\u2014never; tapas\u0101\u2014by serious\npenances; na\u2014never; d\u0101nena\u2014by charity; na\u2014never; ca\u2014also; ijyay\u0101\u2014by worship;\n\u015bakya\u1e25\u2014is it possible; evam-vidha\u1e25\u2014like this; dra\u1e63\u1e6dum\u2014to see; d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dav\u0101n\u2014seeing;\nasi\u2014you are; m\u0101m\u2014Me; yath\u0101\u2014as.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThe form which you are seeing with your transcendental eyes cannot be understood\nsimply by studying the Vedas, nor by undergoing serious penances, nor by\ncharity, nor by worship.

This mystery is\nvery difficult to understand for those who are atheists or who are devoid of\ndevotional service. For scholars who have simply studied Vedic literature by way\nof speculation or out of mere academic interest, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not easy to\nunderstand. Nor is He to he understood by persons who officially go to the\ntemple to offer worship. They make their visit, but they cannot understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nas He is. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can be understood only through the path of devotional service,\nas explained by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself in the next verse.\n\n\n11.54\n\n\nbhakty\u0101 tv ananyay\u0101 \u015bakya\n\n\naham eva\u1e41-vidho \u2019rjuna\n\n\nj\u00f1\u0101tu\u1e41 dra\u1e63\u1e6du\u1e41 ca tattvena\n\n\nprave\u1e63\u1e6du\u1e41 ca parantapa\n\n\nbhakty\u0101\u2014by devotional service; tu\u2014but; ananyay\u0101\u2014without being mixed with\nfruitive activities or speculative knowledge; \u015bakya\u1e25\u2014possible; aham\u2014I;\nevam-vidha\u1e25\u2014like this; arjuna\u2014O Arjuna; j\u00f1\u0101tum\u2014to know; dra\u1e63\u1e6dum\u2014to see;\ntattvena\u2014in fact; prave\u1e63\u1e6dum\u2014and to enter into; ca\u2014also; parantapa\u2014O mighty-armed\none.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nMy dear Arjuna, only by undivided devotional service can I be understood as I\nam, standing before you, and can thus be seen directly. Only in this way can you\nenter into the mysteries of My understanding.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can be understood only by the process of undivided devotional service. He\nexplicitly explains this in this verse so unauthorized commentators, who try to\nunderstand Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 by the speculative process, will know that they are\nsimply wasting their time. No one can understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or how He came from\nparents in a four-handed form and at once changed Himself into a two-handed\nform. It is clearly stated here that no one can see Him. Those who, however, are\nvery experienced students of Vedic literature can learn about Him from the Vedic\nliterature in so many ways. There are so many rules and regulations, and if one\nat all wants to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he must follow the regulative principles\ndescribed in the authoritative literature. One can perform penance in accordance\nwith those principles. As far as charity is concerned, it is plain that charity\nshould be given to the devotees of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a who are engaged in His devotional\nservice to spread the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a philosophy or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness throughout the\nworld. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is a benediction to humanity. Lord Caitanya was\nappreciated by R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b as the most munificent man of charity because love\nof K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, which is very difficult to achieve, was distributed freely by Him. And\nif one worships as prescribed in the temple (in the temples in India there is\nalways some statue, usually of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a), that is a chance to progress.\nFor the beginners in devotional service to the Lord, temple worship is very\nessential, and this is confirmed in the Vedic literature.\n\n\nOne who has unflinching devotion for the Supreme Lord and is directed by the\nspiritual master can see the Supreme Personality of Godhead by revelation. For\none who does not take personal training under the guidance of a bona fide\nspiritual master, it is impossible to even begin to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The word\ntu is specifically used here to indicate that no other process can be used, can\nbe recommended, or can be successful in understanding K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\n\n\nThe personal forms of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the two-handed form and the four-handed, are\ncompletely different from the temporary universal form shown to Arjuna. The\nfour-handed form is N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, and the two-handed form is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; they are eternal\nand transcendental, whereas the universal form exhibited to Arjuna is temporary.\nThe very word sudurdar\u015bam, meaning difficult to see, suggests that no one saw\nthat universal form. It also suggests that amongst the devotees there was no\nnecessity of showing it. That form was exhibited by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a at the request of\nArjuna because in the future, when one represents himself as an incarnation of\nGod, people can ask to see his universal form.\n\n\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a changes from the universal form to the four-handed form of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a and\nthen to His own natural form of two hands. This indicates that the four-handed\nforms and other forms mentioned in Vedic literature are all emanations of the\noriginal two-handed K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He is the origin of all emanations. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is distinct\neven from these forms, not to speak of the impersonal conception. As far as the\nfour-handed forms of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are concerned, it is stated clearly that even the\nmost identical four-handed form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (which is known as Mah\u0101-Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, who is\nlying on the cosmic ocean and from whose breathing so many innumerable universes\nare passing out and entering) is also an expansion of the Supreme Lord.\nTherefore one should conclusively worship the personal form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead who is eternity, bliss and knowledge. He is the\nsource of all forms of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, He is the source of all forms of incarnation, and\nHe is the original Supreme Personality, as confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.\n\n\nIn the Vedic literature it is stated that the Supreme Absolute Truth is a\nperson. His name is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and He sometimes descends on this earth. Similarly,\nin \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam there is a description of all kinds of incarnations of the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead, and there it is said that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not an\nincarnation of God but is the original Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself.\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47as tu bhagav\u0101n svayam. Similarly, in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 the Lord says, matta\u1e25\nparataram n\u0101ny\u0101t: \u201cThere is nothing superior to My form as the Personality of\nGodhead K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u201d He also says elsewhere in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, aham \u0101dir hi dev\u0101n\u0101m:\n\u201cI am the origin of all the demigods.\u201d And after understanding Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101\nfrom K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Arjuna also confirms this in the following words: para\u1e41 brahma para\u1e41\ndh\u0101ma pavitra\u1e41 parama\u1e41 bhav\u0101n: \u201cI now fully understand that You are the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth, and that You are the refuge of\neverything.\u201d Therefore the universal form which K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a showed to Arjuna is not\nthe original form of God. The original is the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a form. The universal form,\nwith its thousands and thousands of heads and hands, is manifest just to draw\nthe attention of those who have no love for God. It is not God\u2019s original form.\n\n\nThe universal form is not attractive for pure devotees, who are in love with the\nLord in different transcendental relationships. The Supreme Godhead exchanges\ntranscendental love in His original form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore to Arjuna, who was\nso intimately related with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in friendship, this form of the universal\nmanifestation was not pleasing; rather, it was fearful. Arjuna, who is a\nconstant companion of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s, must have had transcendental eyes; he was not an\nordinary man. Therefore he was not captivated by the universal form. This form\nmay seem wonderful to persons who are involved in elevating themselves by\nfruitive activities, but to persons who are engaged in devotional service, the\ntwo-handed form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the most dear.\n\n\n11.55\n\n\nmat-karma-k\u1e5bn mat-paramo\n\n\nmad-bhakta\u1e25 sa\u1e45ga-varjita\u1e25\n\n\nnirvaira\u1e25 sarva-bh\u016bte\u1e63u\n\n\nya\u1e25 sa m\u0101m eti p\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dava\n\n\nmat-karma-k\u1e5bt\u2014engaged in doing My work; mat-parama\u1e25\u2014concerning Me, the Supreme;\nmat-bhakta\u1e25\u2014engaged in My devotional service; sa\u1e45ga-varjita\u1e25\u2014freed from the\ncontamination of previous activities and mental speculation; nirvaira\u1e25\u2014without\nan enemy; sarva-bh\u016bte\u1e63u\u2014to every living entity; ya\u1e25\u2014one who; sa\u1e25\u2014he; m\u0101m\u2014unto\nMe; eti\u2014comes; p\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dava\u2014O son of P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nMy dear Arjuna, one who is engaged in My pure devotional service, free from the\ncontaminations of previous activities and from mental speculation, who is\nfriendly to every living entity, certainly comes to Me.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nAnyone who wants to approach the Supreme of all the Personalities of Godhead, on\nthe K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aloka planet in the spiritual sky, and be intimately connected with the\nSupreme Personality, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, must take this formula, as is stated by the Supreme\nHimself. Therefore, this verse is considered to be the essence of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.\nThe Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is a book directed to the conditioned souls, who are engaged\nin the material world with the purpose of lording it over nature and who do not\nknow of the real, spiritual life. The Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is meant to show how one can\nunderstand his spiritual existence and his eternal relationship with the Supreme\nSpiritual Personality and to teach one how to go back home, back to Godhead. Now\nhere is the verse which clearly explains the process by which one can attain\nsuccess in his spiritual activity: devotional service. As far as work is\nconcerned, one should transfer his energy entirely to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious\nactivities. No work should be done by any man except in relationship to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\nThis called K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-karma. One may be engaged in various activities, but one\nshould not be attached to the result of his work, but the result should be done\nfor Him. For example, one may be engaged in business, but to transform that\nactivity into K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, one has to do business for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. If K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is\nthe proprietor of the business, then K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a should enjoy the profit of the\nbusiness. If a businessman is in possession of thousands and thousands of\ndollars, and if he has to offer all this to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he can do it. This is work\nfor K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Instead of constructing a big building for his sense gratification,\nhe can construct a nice temple for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and he can install the Deity of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nand arrange for the Deity\u2019s service, as is outlined in the authorized books of\ndevotional service. This is all K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-karma. One should not be attached to the\nresult of his work, but the result should be offered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. One should also\naccept as pras\u0101dam, food, the remnants of offerings to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. If, however, one\nis not able to construct a temple for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one can engage himself in cleansing\nthe temple of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; that is also K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-karma. One can cultivate a garden.\nAnyone who has land\u2014in India, at least, any poor man has a certain amount of\nland\u2014can utilize that for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by growing flowers to offer Him. He can sow\ntulas\u012b plants because tulas\u012b leaves are very important, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has\nrecommended this in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a desires that one offer Him either a\nleaf, or a flower, or a little water\u2014and He is satisfied. This leaf especially\nrefers to the tulas\u012b So one can sow tulas\u012b leaves and pour water on the plant.\nThus, even the poorest man can engage in the service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. These are some of\nthe examples of how one can engage in working for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\n\n\nThe word mat-parama\u1e25 refers to one who considers the association of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in His\nsupreme abode to be the highest perfection of life. Such a person does not wish\nto be elevated to the higher planets such as the moon or sun or heavenly\nplanets, or even the highest planet of this universe, Brahmaloka. He has no\nattraction for that. He is only attracted to being transferred to the spiritual\nsky. And even in the spiritual sky he is not satisfied with merging into the\nglowing brahmajyoti effulgence, for he wants to enter the highest spiritual\nplanet, namely K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aloka, Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. He has full knowledge of that\nplanet, and therefore he is not interested in any other. As indicated by the\nword mad-bhakta\u1e25, he fully engages in devotional service, specifically in the\nnine processes of devotional engagement: hearing, chanting, remembering,\nworshiping, serving the lotus feet of the Lord, offering prayers, carrying out\nthe orders of the Lord, making friends with Him, and surrendering everything to\nHim. One can engage in all nine devotional processes, or eight, or seven, or at\nleast in one, and that will surely make one perfect.\n\n\nThe term sa\u1e45ga-varjita\u1e25 is very significant. One should disassociate himself\nfrom persons who are against K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Not only are the atheistic persons against\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but also those who are attracted to fruitive activities and mental\nspeculation. Therefore the pure form of devotional service is described in\nBhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu as follows: any\u0101bhil\u0101\u1e63it\u0101-\u015b\u016bnya\u1e41 j\u00f1\u0101na-karm\u0101dy-an\u0101v\u1e5btam\n\u0101nuk\u016blyena k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47\u0101nu\u015b\u012blana\u1e41 bhaktir uttam\u0101. In this verse \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b\nclearly states that if anyone wants to execute unalloyed devotional service, he\nmust be freed from all kinds of material contamination. He must be freed from\nthe association of persons who are addicted to fruitive activities and mental\nspeculation. When, freed from such unwanted association and from the\ncontamination of material desires, one favorably cultivates knowledge of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a,\nthat is called pure devotional service. \u0100nuk\u016blyasya sa\u1e45kapla\u1e25 pr\u0101tik\u016blyasya\nvarjanam. One should think of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and act for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a favorably, not\nunfavorably. Ka\u1e41sa was an enemy of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s. From the very beginning of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s\nbirth, he planned in so many ways to kill Him, and because he was always\nunsuccessful, he was always thinking of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Thus while working, while eating\nand while sleeping, he was always K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious in every respect, but that\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness was not favorable, and therefore in spite of his always\nthinking of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a twenty-four hours a day, he was considered a demon, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nat last killed him. Of course anyone who is killed by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a attains salvation\nimmediately, but that is not the aim of the pure devotee. The pure devotee does\nnot even want salvation. He does not want to be transferred even to the highest\nplanet, Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. His only objective is to serve K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a wherever he may\nbe.\n\n\nA devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is friendly to everyone. Therefore it is said here that he\nhas no enemy. How is this? A devotee situated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness knows that\nonly devotional service to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can relieve a person from all the problems of\nlife. He has personal experience of this, and therefore he wants to introduce\nthis system, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, into human society. There are many examples in\nhistory of devotees of the Lord risking their lives for the spreading of God\nconsciousness. The favorite example is Lord Jesus Christ. He was crucified by\nthe nondevotees, but He sacrificed His life for spreading God consciousness. Of\ncourse, it would be superficial to understand that He was killed. Similarly, in\nIndia also there are many examples, such as \u1e6ch\u0101kur Harid\u0101sa. Why such risk?\nBecause they wanted to spread K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, and it is difficult. A K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconscious person knows that if a man is suffering, it is due to his\nforgetfulness of his eternal relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore, the highest\nbenefit one can render to human society is relieving one\u2019s neighbor from all\nmaterial problems. In such a way, a pure devotee is engaged in the service of\nthe Lord. Now, we can imagine how merciful K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is to those engaged in His\nservice, risking everything for Him. Therefore it is certain that such persons\nmust reach the supreme planet after leaving the body.\n\n\nIn summary, the universal form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, which is a temporary manifestation, and\nthe form of time which devours everything, and even the form of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u,\nfour-handed, have all been exhibited by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Thus K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the origin of all\nthese manifestations. It is not that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is a manifestation of the original\nvi\u015bva-r\u016bpa, or Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the origin of all forms. There are hundreds and\nthousands of Vi\u1e63\u1e47us, but for a devotee, no form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is important but the\noriginal form, two-handed \u015ay\u0101masundara. In the Brahm\u0101-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 it is stated that\nthose who are attached to the \u015ay\u0101masundara form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in love and devotion\ncan see Him always within the heart and cannot see anything else. One should\nunderstand, therefore, that the purport of this Eleventh Chapter is that the\nform of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is essential and supreme.",

TRANSLATION  Arjuna said: I have heard Your instruction on confidential spiritual matters\nwhich You have so kindly delivered unto me, and my illusion is now dispelled.  PURPORT  This chapter reveals K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the cause of all causes. He is even the cause of\nthe Mah\u0101-Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, and from Him the material universes emanate. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not an\nincarnation; He is the source of all incarnations. That has been completely\nexplained in the last chapter.  Now, as far as Arjuna is concerned, he says that his illusion is over. This\nmeans that Arjuna no longer thinks of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as a mere human being, as a friend\nof his, but as the source of everything. Arjuna is very enlightened and is glad\nthat he has a great friend like K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but now he is thinking that although he\nmay accept K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the source of everything, others may not. So in order to\nestablish K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s divinity for all, he is requesting K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in this chapter to\nshow His universal form. Actually when one sees the universal form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a one\nbecomes frightened, like Arjuna, but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is so kind that after showing it He\nconverts Himself again into His original form. Arjuna agrees to what K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says\nseveral times. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is speaking to him just for his benefit, and Arjuna\nacknowledges that all this is happening to him by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s grace. He is now\nconvinced that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the cause of all causes and is present in everyone\u2019s\nheart as the Supersoul.",

I want to see that form of Yours.  PURPORT  The Lord said that because He entered into the material universe by His personal\nrepresentation, the cosmic manifestation has been made possible and is going on.\nNow as far as Arjuna is concerned, he is inspired by the statements of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a,\nbut in order to convince others in the future who may think that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is an\nordinary person, he desires to see Him actually in His universal form, to see\nhow He is acting from within the universe, although He is apart from it.\nArjuna\u2019s asking the Lord\u2019s permission is also significant. Since the Lord is the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead, He is present within Arjuna himself; therefore\nHe knows the desire of Arjuna, and He can understand that Arjuna has no special\ndesire to see Him in His universal form, for he is completely satisfied to see\nHim in His personal form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. But He can understand also that Arjuna wants\nto see the universal form to convince others. He did not have any personal\ndesire for confirmation. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a also understands that Arjuna wants to see the\nuniversal form to set a criterion, for in the future there would be so many\nimposters who would pose themselves as incarnations of God. The people,\ntherefore, should be careful; one who claims to be K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a should be prepared to\nshow his universal form to confirm his claim to the people.",

TRANSLATION  If You think that I am able to behold Your cosmic form, O my Lord, O master of\nall mystic power, then kindly show me that universal self.  PURPORT  It is said that one can neither see, hear, understand nor perceive the Supreme\nLord, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, by the material senses. But if one is engaged in loving\ntranscendental service to the Lord from the beginning, then one can see the Lord\nby revelation. Every living entity is only a spiritual spark; therefore it is\nnot possible to see or to understand the Supreme Lord. Arjuna, as a devotee,\ndoes not depend on his speculative strength; rather, he admits his limitations\nas a living entity and acknowledges K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s inestimable position. Arjuna could\nunderstand that for a living entity it is not possible to understand the\nunlimited infinite. If the infinite reveals Himself, then it is possible to\nunderstand the nature of the infinite by the grace of the infinite. The word\nyoge\u015bvara is also very significant here because the Lord has inconceivable\npower. If He likes, He can reveal Himself by His grace, although He is\nunlimited. Therefore Arjuna pleads for the inconceivable grace of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He does\nnot give K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a orders. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not obliged to reveal Himself to anyone unless\none surrenders fully in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and engages in devotional service.\nThus it is not possible for persons who depend on the strength of their mental\nspeculations to see K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",

PURPORT  A pure devotee does not like to see K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in any form except His form with two\nhands; a devotee must see His universal form by His grace, not with the mind but\nwith spiritual eyes. To see the universal form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Arjuna is told not to\nchange his mind but his vision. The universal form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not very\nimportant; that will be clear in the verses. Yet because Arjuna wanted to see\nit, the Lord gives him the particular vision required to see that universal\nform.  Devotees who are correctly situated in a transcendental relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nare attracted by loving features, not by a godless display of opulences. The\nplaymates of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the friends of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and the parents of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a never want\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to show His opulences. They are so immersed in pure love that they do not\neven know that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In their loving\nexchange they forget that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Lord. In the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam it\nis stated that the boys who play with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are all highly pious souls, and\nafter many, many births they are able to play with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Such boys do not know\nthat K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. They take Him as a personal\nfriend. The Supreme Person is considered as the impersonal Brahman by great\nsages, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead by the devotees, and as a product\nof this material nature by ordinary men. The fact is that the devotee is not\nconcerned to see the vi\u015bva-r\u016bpa, the universal form, but Arjuna wanted to see it\nto substantiate K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s statement so that in the future people could understand\nthat K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a not only theoretically or philosophically presented Himself as the\nSupreme but actually presented Himself as such to Arjuna. Arjuna must confirm\nthis because Arjuna is the beginning of the parampar\u0101 system. Those who are\nactually interested to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and\nwho follow in the footsteps of Arjuna should understand that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a not only\ntheoretically presented Himself as the Supreme, but actually revealed Himself as\nthe Supreme.  The Lord gave Arjuna the necessary power to see His universal form because He\nknew that Arjuna did not particularly want to see it, as we have already\nexplained.",

Arjuna was not in favor of the fight, and he thought it was better not to fight;\nthen there would be no frustration. In reply, the Lord is saying that even if he\ndid not fight, every one of them would be destroyed, for that is His plan. If he\nstopped fighting, they would die in another way. Death cannot be checked, even\nif he did not fight. In fact, they were already dead. Time is destruction, and\nall manifestations are to be vanquished by the desire of the Supreme Lord.

This word is also very\nsignificant. The whole world is moving according to the plan of the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead.

There are many so-called scientists who suggest that\nperhaps it was like this, or maybe like that, but there is no question of\n\u201cperhaps\u201d and \u201cmaybe.\u201d There is a specific plan being carried out in this\nmaterial world. What is this plan? This cosmic manifestation is a chance for the\nconditioned souls to go back to Godhead, back to home. As long they have the\ndomineering mentality which makes them try to lord it over material nature, they\nare conditioned. But anyone who can understand the plan of the Supreme Lord and\ncultivate K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is most intelligent. The creation and destruction\nof the cosmic manifestation are under the superior guidance of God. Thus the\nBattle of Kuruk\u1e63etra was fought according to the plan of God. Arjuna was\nrefusing to fight, but he was told that he should fight and at the same time\ndesire the Supreme Lord. Then he would be happy. If one is in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness and if his life is devoted to His transcendental service, he is\nperfect.",

Although the perfected beings offer You their\nrespectful homage, the demons are afraid, and they flee here and there. All this\nis rightly done.  PURPORT  Arjuna, after hearing from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a about the outcome of the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra,\nbecame an enlightened devotee of the Supreme Lord. He admitted that everything\ndone by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is quite fit. Arjuna confirmed that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the maintainer and\nthe object of worship for the devotees and the destroyer of the undesirables.\nHis actions are equally good for all. Arjuna understood herein that when the\nBattle of Kuruk\u1e63etra was being concluded, in outer space there were present many\ndemigods, siddhas, and the intelligentia of the higher planets, and they were\nobserving the fight because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was present there. When Arjuna saw the\nuniversal form of the Lord, the demigods took pleasure in it, but others, who\nwere demons and atheists, could not stand it when the Lord was praised. Out of\ntheir natural fear of the devastating form of the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead, they fled. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s treatment of the devotees and the atheists is\npraised by Arjuna. In all cases a devotee glorifies the Lord because he knows\nthat whatever He does is good for all.",

O refuge of the\nuniverse, You are the invincible source, the cause of all causes, transcendental\nto this material manifestation.  PURPORT  By this offering of obeisances, Arjuna indicates that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is worshipable by\neveryone. He is all-pervading, and He is the Soul of every soul. Arjuna is\naddressing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as mah\u0101tm\u0101, which means that He is most magnanimous and\nunlimited. Ananta indicates that there is nothing which is not covered by the\ninfluence and energy of the Supreme Lord, and deve\u015ba means that He is the\ncontroller of all demigods and is above them all. He is the center of the whole\nuniverse. Arjuna also thought that it was fitting that all the perfect living\nentities and all powerful demigods offer their respectful obeisances unto Him\nbecause no one is greater than Him. He especially mentions that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is greater\nthan Brahm\u0101 because Brahm\u0101 is created by Him. Brahm\u0101 is born out of the lotus\nstem grown from the navel abdomen of Garbhodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, who is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s\nplenary expansion; therefore Brahm\u0101 and Lord \u015aiva, who is born of Brahm\u0101, and\nall other demigods must offer their respectful obeisances. Thus the Lord is\nrespected by Lord \u015aiva and Brahm\u0101 and similar other demigods. The word ak\u1e63aram\nis very significant because this material creation is subject to destruction,\nbut the Lord is above this material creation. He is the cause of all causes, and\nbeing so, He is superior to all the conditioned souls within this material\nnature as well as the material cosmic manifestation itself. He is therefore the\nall-great Supreme.",

No one is equal to You, nor can anyone be one with You.\nWithin the three worlds, You are immeasurable.  PURPORT  The Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is worshipable as a father is worshipable for his son. He is the\nspiritual master because He originally gave the Vedic instructions to Brahm\u0101,\nand presently He is also instructing Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 to Arjuna; therefore He is\nthe original spiritual master, and any bona fide spiritual master at the present\nmoment must be a descendant in the line of disciplic succession stemming from\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Without being a representative of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one cannot become a teacher or\nspiritual master of transcendental subject matter.  The Lord is being paid obeisances in all respects. He is of immeasurable\ngreatness. No one can be greater than the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a,\nbecause no one is equal to or higher than K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a within any manifestation,\nspiritual or material. Everyone is below Him. No one can excel Him.  The Supreme Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has senses and a body like the ordinary man, but for Him\nthere is no difference between His senses, body, mind and Himself. Foolish\npersons who do not know Him perfectly say that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is different from His soul,\nmind, heart and everything else. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is absolute; therefore His activities and\npotencies are supreme. It is also stated that He does not have senses like ours.\nHe can perform all sensual activities; therefore His senses are neither\nimperfect nor limited. No one can be greater than Him, no one can be equal to\nHim, and everyone is lower than Him.  Whoever knows His transcendental body, activities and perfection, after quitting\nhis body, returns to Him and doesn\u2019t come back again to this miserable world.\nTherefore one should know that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s activities are different from others. The\nbest policy is to follow the principles of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; that will make one perfect. It\nis also stated that there is no one who is master of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; everyone is His\nservant. Only K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is God, and everyone is servant. Everyone is complying with\nHis order. There is no one who can deny His order. Everyone is acting according\nto His direction, being under His superintendence.

TRANSLATION  After seeing this universal form, which I have never seen before, I am\ngladdened, but at the same time my mind is disturbed with fear. Therefore please\nbestow Your grace upon me and reveal again Your form as the Personality of\nGodhead, O Lord of lords, O abode of the universe.  PURPORT  Arjuna is always in confidence with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a because he is a very dear friend, and\nas a dear friend is gladdened by his friend\u2019s opulence, Arjuna is very joyful to\nsee that his friend, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and can show\nsuch a wonderful universal form. But at the same time, after seeing that\nuniversal form, he is afraid that he has committed so many offenses to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a out\nof his unalloyed friendship. Thus his mind is disturbed out of fear, although he\nhad no reason to fear. Arjuna therefore is asking K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to show His N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a\nform because He can assume any form. This universal form is material and\ntemporary, as the material world is temporary. But in the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets He\nhas His transcendental form with four hands as N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. There are innumerable\nplanets in the spiritual sky, and in each of them K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is present by His\nplenary manifestations of different names. Thus Arjuna desired to see one of the\nforms manifest in the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets. Of course in each Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planet the\nform of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a is four-handed, and the four hands hold different symbols, the\nconchshell, mace, lotus and disc. According to the different hands these four\nthings are held in, the N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47as are named. All of these forms are one and the\nsame to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; therefore Arjuna requests to see His four-handed feature.",

He\nis now asking to see the form of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, a spiritual form.

He is not different from His plenary expansions, and He is God in any of\nHis innumerable forms. In all of these forms He is fresh like a young man. That\nis the constant feature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One who knows\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a at once becomes free from all contamination of the material world.",

TRANSLATION  The Blessed Lord said: My dear Arjuna, happily do I show you this universal form\nwithin the material world by My internal potency. No one before you has ever\nseen this unlimited and glaringly effulgent form.  PURPORT  Arjuna wanted to see the universal form of the Supreme Lord, so out of His mercy\nupon His devotee Arjuna, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a showed His universal form full of effulgence\nand opulence. This form was glaring like the sun, and its many faces were\nrapidly changing. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a showed this form just to satisfy the desire of His\nfriend Arjuna. This form was manifested by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a through His internal potency,\nwhich is inconceivable by human speculation. No one had seen this universal form\nof the Lord before Arjuna, but because the form was shown to Arjuna, other\ndevotees in the heavenly planets and in other planets in outer space could also\nsee it. They did not see it before, but because of Arjuna they were also able to\nsee it. In other words, all the disciplic devotees of the Lord could see the\nuniversal form which was shown to Arjuna by the mercy of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Someone\ncommented that this form was shown to Duryodhana also when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a went to\nDuryodhana to negotiate for peace. Unfortunately, Duryodhana did not accept the\npeace offer, but at that time K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a manifested some of His universal forms. But\nthose forms are different from this one shown to Arjuna. It is clearly said that\nno one has ever seen this form before.",

TRANSLATION  O best of the Kuru warriors, no one before you has ever seen this universal form\nof Mine, for neither by studying the Vedas, nor by performing sacrifices, nor by\ncharities or similar activities can this form be seen. Only you have seen this.  PURPORT  The divine vision in this connection should be clearly understood. Who can have\ndivine vision? Divine means godly. Unless one attains the status of divinity as\na demigod, he cannot have divine vision. And what is a demigod? It is stated in\nthe Vedic scriptures that those who are devotees of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u are demigods.\nThose who are atheistic, i.e., who do not believe in Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, or who only\nrecognize the impersonal part of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the Supreme, cannot have the divine\nvision. It is not possible to decry K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and at the same time have the divine\nvision. One cannot have the divine vision without becoming divine. In other\nwords, those who have divine vision can also see like Arjuna.  The Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 gives the description of the universal form, and this\ndescription was unknown to everyone before Arjuna. Now one can have some idea of\nthe vi\u015bva-r\u016bpa after this incidence; those who are actually divine can see the\nuniversal form of the Lord. But one cannot be divine without being a pure\ndevotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The devotees, however, who are actually in the divine nature\nand who have divine vision, are not very much interested to see the universal\nform of the Lord. As described in the previous verse, Arjuna desired to see the\nfour-handed form of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, and he was actually afraid of the\nuniversal form.  In this verse there are some significant words, just like veda-yaj\u00f1\u0101dhya-yanai\u1e25,\nwhich refers to studying Vedic literature and the subject matter of sacrificial\nregulations. Veda refers to all kinds of Vedic literature, namely the four Vedas\n(\u1e5ak, Yajus, S\u0101ma and Atharva) and the eighteen Pur\u0101\u1e47as and Upani\u1e63ads, and\nVed\u0101nta-s\u016btra. One can study these at home or anywhere else. Similarly, there\nare s\u016btras, Kalpa-s\u016btras and M\u012bm\u0101\u1e41s\u0101-s\u016btras, for studying the method of\nsacrifice. D\u0101nai\u1e25 refers to charity which is offered to a suitable party. such\nas those who are engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, the\nbr\u0101hma\u1e47as and the Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas. Similarly, pious activities refer to the\nagni-hotra, etc., the prescribed duties of the different castes. Pious\nactivities and the voluntary acceptance of some bodily pains are called tapasya.\nSo one can perform all these, can accept bodily penances, give charity, study\nthe Vedas, etc., but unless he is a devotee like Arjuna, it is not possible to\nsee that universal form. Those who are impersonalists are also imagining that\nthey are seeing the universal form of the Lord, but from Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 we\nunderstand that the impersonalists are not devotees. Therefore they are unable\nto see the universal form of the Lord.  There are many persons who create incarnations. They falsely claim an ordinary\nhuman to be an incarnation, but this is all foolishness. We should follow the\nprinciples of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, otherwise there is no possibility of attaining\nperfect spiritual knowledge. Although Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is considered the\npreliminary study of the science of God, still it is so perfect that one can\ndistinguish what is what. The followers of a pseudo incarnation may say that\nthey have also seen the transcendental incarnation of God, the universal form,\nbut that is not acceptable because it is clearly stated here that unless one\nbecomes a devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one cannot see the universal form of God. So one\nfirst of all has to become a pure devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; then he can claim that he\ncan show the universal form of what he has seen. A devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a cannot\naccept false incarnations or followers of false incarnations.",

TRANSLATION  Your mind has been perturbed upon seeing this horrible feature of Mine. Now let\nit be finished. My devotee, be free from all disturbance. With a peaceful mind\nyou can now see the form you desire.  PURPORT  In the beginning of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 Arjuna was worried about killing Bh\u012b\u1e63ma and\nDro\u1e47a, his worshipful grandfathers and masters. But K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a said that he need not\nbe afraid of killing his grandfather. When they tried to disrobe Draupad\u012b in the\nassembly, Bh\u012b\u1e63ma and Dro\u1e47a were silent, and for such negligence of duty they\nshould be killed. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a showed His universal form to Arjuna just to show him\nthat these people were already killed for their unlawful action. That scene was\nshown to Arjuna because devotees are always peaceful, and they cannot perform\nsuch horrible actions. The purpose of the revelation of the universal form was\nshown; now Arjuna wanted to see the four-armed form, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a showed him. A\ndevotee is not much interested in the universal form, for it does not enable one\nto reciprocate loving feelings. A devotee wants to offer his respectful\nworshiping feelings; thus he wants to see the two-handed or four-handed K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nform so he can reciprocate in loving service with the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead.",

In the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101\nit is stated that only a person whose eyes are smeared with the ointment of love\ncan see the beautiful form of \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",

PURPORT  Here the words m\u0101nu\u1e63a\u1e41 r\u016bpam clearly indicate the Supreme Personality of Godhead\nto be originally two-handed. Those who deride K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to be an ordinary person are\nshown here to be ignorant of His divine nature. If K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is like an ordinary\nhuman being, then how is it possible for Him to show the universal form and\nagain to show the four-handed N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a form? So it is very clearly stated in\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that one who thinks that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is an ordinary person and misguides\nthe reader by claiming that it is the impersonal Brahman within K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a speaking,\nis doing the greatest injustice. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has actually shown His universal form and\nHis fourhanded Vi\u1e63\u1e47u form. So how can He be an ordinary human being? A pure\ndevotee is not confused by misguiding commentaries on Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 because he\nknows what is what. The original verses of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 are as clear as the\nsun; they do not require lamplight from foolish commentators.",

TRANSLATION  The Blessed Lord said: My dear Arjuna, the form which you are now seeing is very\ndifficult to behold. Even the demigods are ever seeking the opportunity to see\nthis form which is so dear.  PURPORT  In the forty-eighth verse of this chapter Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a concluded revealing His\nuniversal form and informed Arjuna that this form is not possible to be seen by\nso many activities, sacrifices, etc. Now here the word sudurdar\u015bam is used,\nindicating that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s two-handed form is still more confidential. One may be\nable to see the universal form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by adding a little tinge of devotional\nservice to various activities like penance, Vedic study and philosophical\nspeculation, etc. It may be possible, but without a tinge of bhakti, one cannot\nsee; that has already been explained. Still, beyond that universal form, the\nform of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as a two-handed man is still more difficult to see, even for\ndemigods like Brahm\u0101 and Lord \u015aiva. They desire to see Him, and we have\nevidences in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam that when He was supposed to be in the womb\nof His mother, Devak\u012b, all the demigods from heaven came to see the marvel of\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. They even waited to see Him. A foolish person may deride Him, but that is\nan ordinary person. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is actually desired to be seen by demigods like Brahm\u0101\nand \u015aiva in His two-armed form.  In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 it is also confirmed that He is not visible to the foolish\npersons who deride Him. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s body, as confirmed by Brahm\u0101-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 and\nconfirmed by Himself in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, is completely spiritual and full of bliss\nand eternality. His body is never like a material body. But for some who make a\nstudy of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by reading Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 or similar Vedic scriptures, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is a\nproblem. For one using a material process, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is considered to be a great\nhistorical personality and very learned philosopher. But He isn\u2019t an ordinary\nman. But some think that even though He was so powerful, He had to accept a\nmaterial body. Ultimately they think that the Absolute Truth is impersonal;\ntherefore they think that from His impersonal feature He assumed a personal\nfeature attached to material nature. This is a materialistic calculation of the\nSupreme Lord. Another calculation is speculative. Those who are in search of\nknowledge also speculate on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and consider Him to be less important than the\nuniversal form of the Supreme. Thus some think that the universal form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nwhich was manifested to Arjuna is more important than His personal form.\nAccording to them, the personal form of the Supreme is something imaginary. They\nbelieve that in the ultimate issue, the Absolute Truth is not a person. But the\ntranscendental process is described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, Chapter Two: to hear about\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a from authorities. That is the actual Vedic process, and those who are\nactually in the Vedic line hear about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a from authority, and by repeated\nhearing about Him, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a becomes dear. As we have several times discussed, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nis covered by His yoga-m\u0101y\u0101 potency. He is not to be seen or revealed to anyone\nand everyone. Only by one to whom He reveals Himself can He be seen. This is\nconfirmed in Vedic literature; for one who is a surrendered soul, the Absolute\nTruth can actually be understood. The transcendentalist, by continuous K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness and by devotional service to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, can have his spiritual eyes\nopened and can see K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by revelation. Such a revelation is not possible even\nfor the demigods; therefore it is difficult even for the demigods to understand\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and the advanced demigods are always in hope of seeing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in His\ntwo-handed form. The conclusion is that although to see the universal form of\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is very, very difficult and not possible for anyone and everyone, it is\nstill more difficult to understand His personal form as \u015ay\u0101masundara.",

This mystery is\nvery difficult to understand for those who are atheists or who are devoid of\ndevotional service.

TRANSLATION  My dear Arjuna, only by undivided devotional service can I be understood as I\nam, standing before you, and can thus be seen directly. Only in this way can you\nenter into the mysteries of My understanding.  PURPORT  K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can be understood only by the process of undivided devotional service. He\nexplicitly explains this in this verse so unauthorized commentators, who try to\nunderstand Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 by the speculative process, will know that they are\nsimply wasting their time. No one can understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or how He came from\nparents in a four-handed form and at once changed Himself into a two-handed\nform. It is clearly stated here that no one can see Him. Those who, however, are\nvery experienced students of Vedic literature can learn about Him from the Vedic\nliterature in so many ways. There are so many rules and regulations, and if one\nat all wants to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he must follow the regulative principles\ndescribed in the authoritative literature. One can perform penance in accordance\nwith those principles. As far as charity is concerned, it is plain that charity\nshould be given to the devotees of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a who are engaged in His devotional\nservice to spread the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a philosophy or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness throughout the\nworld. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is a benediction to humanity. Lord Caitanya was\nappreciated by R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b as the most munificent man of charity because love\nof K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, which is very difficult to achieve, was distributed freely by Him. And\nif one worships as prescribed in the temple (in the temples in India there is\nalways some statue, usually of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a), that is a chance to progress.\nFor the beginners in devotional service to the Lord, temple worship is very\nessential, and this is confirmed in the Vedic literature.  One who has unflinching devotion for the Supreme Lord and is directed by the\nspiritual master can see the Supreme Personality of Godhead by revelation. For\none who does not take personal training under the guidance of a bona fide\nspiritual master, it is impossible to even begin to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The word\ntu is specifically used here to indicate that no other process can be used, can\nbe recommended, or can be successful in understanding K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.  The personal forms of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the two-handed form and the four-handed, are\ncompletely different from the temporary universal form shown to Arjuna. The\nfour-handed form is N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, and the two-handed form is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; they are eternal\nand transcendental, whereas the universal form exhibited to Arjuna is temporary.\nThe very word sudurdar\u015bam, meaning difficult to see, suggests that no one saw\nthat universal form. It also suggests that amongst the devotees there was no\nnecessity of showing it. That form was exhibited by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a at the request of\nArjuna because in the future, when one represents himself as an incarnation of\nGod, people can ask to see his universal form.  K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a changes from the universal form to the four-handed form of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a and\nthen to His own natural form of two hands. This indicates that the four-handed\nforms and other forms mentioned in Vedic literature are all emanations of the\noriginal two-handed K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He is the origin of all emanations. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is distinct\neven from these forms, not to speak of the impersonal conception. As far as the\nfour-handed forms of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are concerned, it is stated clearly that even the\nmost identical four-handed form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (which is known as Mah\u0101-Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, who is\nlying on the cosmic ocean and from whose breathing so many innumerable universes\nare passing out and entering) is also an expansion of the Supreme Lord.\nTherefore one should conclusively worship the personal form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead who is eternity, bliss and knowledge. He is the\nsource of all forms of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, He is the source of all forms of incarnation, and\nHe is the original Supreme Personality, as confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.  In the Vedic literature it is stated that the Supreme Absolute Truth is a\nperson. His name is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and He sometimes descends on this earth. Similarly,\nin \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam there is a description of all kinds of incarnations of the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead, and there it is said that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not an\nincarnation of God but is the original Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself.\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47as tu bhagav\u0101n svayam. Similarly, in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 the Lord says, matta\u1e25\nparataram n\u0101ny\u0101t: \u201cThere is nothing superior to My form as the Personality of\nGodhead K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u201d He also says elsewhere in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, aham \u0101dir hi dev\u0101n\u0101m:\n\u201cI am the origin of all the demigods.\u201d And after understanding Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101\nfrom K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Arjuna also confirms this in the following words: para\u1e41 brahma para\u1e41\ndh\u0101ma pavitra\u1e41 parama\u1e41 bhav\u0101n: \u201cI now fully understand that You are the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth, and that You are the refuge of\neverything.\u201d Therefore the universal form which K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a showed to Arjuna is not\nthe original form of God. The original is the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a form. The universal form,\nwith its thousands and thousands of heads and hands, is manifest just to draw\nthe attention of those who have no love for God. It is not God\u2019s original form.  The universal form is not attractive for pure devotees, who are in love with the\nLord in different transcendental relationships. The Supreme Godhead exchanges\ntranscendental love in His original form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore to Arjuna, who was\nso intimately related with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in friendship, this form of the universal\nmanifestation was not pleasing; rather, it was fearful. Arjuna, who is a\nconstant companion of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s, must have had transcendental eyes; he was not an\nordinary man. Therefore he was not captivated by the universal form. This form\nmay seem wonderful to persons who are involved in elevating themselves by\nfruitive activities, but to persons who are engaged in devotional service, the\ntwo-handed form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the most dear.",

TRANSLATION  My dear Arjuna, one who is engaged in My pure devotional service, free from the\ncontaminations of previous activities and from mental speculation, who is\nfriendly to every living entity, certainly comes to Me.  PURPORT  Anyone who wants to approach the Supreme of all the Personalities of Godhead, on\nthe K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aloka planet in the spiritual sky, and be intimately connected with the\nSupreme Personality, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, must take this formula, as is stated by the Supreme\nHimself. Therefore, this verse is considered to be the essence of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.\nThe Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is a book directed to the conditioned souls, who are engaged\nin the material world with the purpose of lording it over nature and who do not\nknow of the real, spiritual life. The Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is meant to show how one can\nunderstand his spiritual existence and his eternal relationship with the Supreme\nSpiritual Personality and to teach one how to go back home, back to Godhead. Now\nhere is the verse which clearly explains the process by which one can attain\nsuccess in his spiritual activity: devotional service. As far as work is\nconcerned, one should transfer his energy entirely to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious\nactivities. No work should be done by any man except in relationship to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\nThis called K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-karma. One may be engaged in various activities, but one\nshould not be attached to the result of his work, but the result should be done\nfor Him. For example, one may be engaged in business, but to transform that\nactivity into K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, one has to do business for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. If K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is\nthe proprietor of the business, then K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a should enjoy the profit of the\nbusiness. If a businessman is in possession of thousands and thousands of\ndollars, and if he has to offer all this to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he can do it. This is work\nfor K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Instead of constructing a big building for his sense gratification,\nhe can construct a nice temple for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and he can install the Deity of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nand arrange for the Deity\u2019s service, as is outlined in the authorized books of\ndevotional service. This is all K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-karma. One should not be attached to the\nresult of his work, but the result should be offered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. One should also\naccept as pras\u0101dam, food, the remnants of offerings to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. If, however, one\nis not able to construct a temple for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one can engage himself in cleansing\nthe temple of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; that is also K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-karma. One can cultivate a garden.\nAnyone who has land\u2014in India, at least, any poor man has a certain amount of\nland\u2014can utilize that for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by growing flowers to offer Him. He can sow\ntulas\u012b plants because tulas\u012b leaves are very important, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has\nrecommended this in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a desires that one offer Him either a\nleaf, or a flower, or a little water\u2014and He is satisfied. This leaf especially\nrefers to the tulas\u012b So one can sow tulas\u012b leaves and pour water on the plant.\nThus, even the poorest man can engage in the service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. These are some of\nthe examples of how one can engage in working for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.  The word mat-parama\u1e25 refers to one who considers the association of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in His\nsupreme abode to be the highest perfection of life. Such a person does not wish\nto be elevated to the higher planets such as the moon or sun or heavenly\nplanets, or even the highest planet of this universe, Brahmaloka. He has no\nattraction for that. He is only attracted to being transferred to the spiritual\nsky. And even in the spiritual sky he is not satisfied with merging into the\nglowing brahmajyoti effulgence, for he wants to enter the highest spiritual\nplanet, namely K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aloka, Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. He has full knowledge of that\nplanet, and therefore he is not interested in any other. As indicated by the\nword mad-bhakta\u1e25, he fully engages in devotional service, specifically in the\nnine processes of devotional engagement: hearing, chanting, remembering,\nworshiping, serving the lotus feet of the Lord, offering prayers, carrying out\nthe orders of the Lord, making friends with Him, and surrendering everything to\nHim. One can engage in all nine devotional processes, or eight, or seven, or at\nleast in one, and that will surely make one perfect.  The term sa\u1e45ga-varjita\u1e25 is very significant. One should disassociate himself\nfrom persons who are against K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Not only are the atheistic persons against\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but also those who are attracted to fruitive activities and mental\nspeculation. Therefore the pure form of devotional service is described in\nBhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu as follows: any\u0101bhil\u0101\u1e63it\u0101-\u015b\u016bnya\u1e41 j\u00f1\u0101na-karm\u0101dy-an\u0101v\u1e5btam\n\u0101nuk\u016blyena k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47\u0101nu\u015b\u012blana\u1e41 bhaktir uttam\u0101. In this verse \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b\nclearly states that if anyone wants to execute unalloyed devotional service, he\nmust be freed from all kinds of material contamination. He must be freed from\nthe association of persons who are addicted to fruitive activities and mental\nspeculation. When, freed from such unwanted association and from the\ncontamination of material desires, one favorably cultivates knowledge of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a,\nthat is called pure devotional service. \u0100nuk\u016blyasya sa\u1e45kapla\u1e25 pr\u0101tik\u016blyasya\nvarjanam. One should think of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and act for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a favorably, not\nunfavorably. Ka\u1e41sa was an enemy of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s. From the very beginning of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s\nbirth, he planned in so many ways to kill Him, and because he was always\nunsuccessful, he was always thinking of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Thus while working, while eating\nand while sleeping, he was always K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious in every respect, but that\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness was not favorable, and therefore in spite of his always\nthinking of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a twenty-four hours a day, he was considered a demon, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nat last killed him. Of course anyone who is killed by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a attains salvation\nimmediately, but that is not the aim of the pure devotee. The pure devotee does\nnot even want salvation. He does not want to be transferred even to the highest\nplanet, Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. His only objective is to serve K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a wherever he may\nbe.  A devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is friendly to everyone. Therefore it is said here that he\nhas no enemy. How is this? A devotee situated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness knows that\nonly devotional service to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can relieve a person from all the problems of\nlife. He has personal experience of this, and therefore he wants to introduce\nthis system, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, into human society. There are many examples in\nhistory of devotees of the Lord risking their lives for the spreading of God\nconsciousness. The favorite example is Lord Jesus Christ. He was crucified by\nthe nondevotees, but He sacrificed His life for spreading God consciousness. Of\ncourse, it would be superficial to understand that He was killed. Similarly, in\nIndia also there are many examples, such as \u1e6ch\u0101kur Harid\u0101sa. Why such risk?\nBecause they wanted to spread K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, and it is difficult. A K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconscious person knows that if a man is suffering, it is due to his\nforgetfulness of his eternal relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore, the highest\nbenefit one can render to human society is relieving one\u2019s neighbor from all\nmaterial problems. In such a way, a pure devotee is engaged in the service of\nthe Lord. Now, we can imagine how merciful K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is to those engaged in His\nservice, risking everything for Him. Therefore it is certain that such persons\nmust reach the supreme planet after leaving the body.  In summary, the universal form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, which is a temporary manifestation, and\nthe form of time which devours everything, and even the form of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u,\nfour-handed, have all been exhibited by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Thus K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the origin of all\nthese manifestations. It is not that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is a manifestation of the original\nvi\u015bva-r\u016bpa, or Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the origin of all forms. There are hundreds and\nthousands of Vi\u1e63\u1e47us, but for a devotee, no form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is important but the\noriginal form, two-handed \u015ay\u0101masundara. In the Brahm\u0101-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 it is stated that\nthose who are attached to the \u015ay\u0101masundara form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in love and devotion\ncan see Him always within the heart and cannot see anything else. One should\nunderstand, therefore, that the purport of this Eleventh Chapter is that the\nform of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is essential and supreme.",

Generally, the transcendentalists\ncan be divided into two classes. One is the impersonalist, and the other is the\npersonalist. The personalist devotee engages himself with all energy in the\nservice of the Supreme Lord. The impersonalist engages himself not directly in\nthe service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a but in meditation on the impersonal Brahman, the\nunmanifested.\n\n\nWe find in this chapter that of the different processes for realization of the\nAbsolute Truth, bhakti-yoga, devotional service, is the highest. If one at all\ndesires to have the association of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, then he\nmust take to devotional service.\n\n\nThose who worship the Supreme Lord directly by devotional service are called\npersonalists. Those who engage themselves in meditation on the impersonal\nBrahman are called impersonalists. Arjuna is here questioning which position is\nbetter. There are different ways to realize the Absolute Truth, but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nindicates in this chapter that bhakti-yoga, or devotional service to Him, is\nhighest of all. It is the most direct, and it is the easiest means for\nassociation with the Godhead.\n\n\nIn the Second Chapter the Lord explains that a living entity is not the material\nbody but is a spiritual spark, a part of the Absolute Truth. In the Seventh\nChapter He speaks of the living entity as part and parcel of the supreme whole\nand recommends that he transfer his attention fully to the whole. In the Eighth\nChapter it is stated that whoever thinks of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a at the moment of death is at\nonce transferred to the spiritual sky, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s abode. And at the end of the\nSixth Chapter the Lord says that out of all the yog\u012bs, he who thinks of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nwithin himself is considered to be the most perfect. So throughout the G\u012bt\u0101\npersonal devotion to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is recommended as the highest form of spiritual\nrealization. Yet there are those who are still attracted to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s impersonal\nbrahmajyoti effulgence, which is the all-pervasive aspect of the Absolute Truth\nand which is unmanifest and beyond the reach of the senses. Arjuna would like to\nknow which of these two types of transcendentalists is more perfect in\nknowledge. In other words, he is clarifying his own position because he is\nattached to the personal form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He is not attached to the impersonal\nBrahman. He wants to know whether his position is secure. The impersonal\nmanifestation, either in this material world or in the spiritual world of the\nSupreme Lord, is a problem for meditation. Actually, one cannot perfectly\nconceive of the impersonal feature of the Absolute Truth. Therefore Arjuna wants\nto say, \u201cWhat is the use of such a waste of time?\u201d Arjuna experienced in the\nEleventh Chapter that to be attached to the personal form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is best\nbecause he could thus understand all other forms at the same time and there was\nno disturbance to his love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This important question asked of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by\nArjuna will clarify the distinction between the impersonal and personal\nconceptions of the Absolute Truth.\n\n\n12.2\n\n\n\u015br\u012b-bhagav\u0101n uv\u0101ca\n\n\nmayy \u0101ve\u015bya mano ye m\u0101\u1e41\n\n\nnitya-yukt\u0101 up\u0101sate\n\n\n\u015braddhay\u0101 parayopet\u0101s\n\n\nte me yuktatam\u0101 mat\u0101\u1e25\n\n\n\u015br\u012b bhagav\u0101n uv\u0101ca\u2014the Supreme Personality of Godhead said; mayi\u2014unto Me;\n\u0101ve\u015bya\u2014fixing; mana\u1e25\u2014mind; ye\u2014one who; m\u0101m\u2014unto Me; nitya\u2014always;\nyukt\u0101\u1e25\u2014engaged; up\u0101sate\u2014worships; \u015braddhay\u0101\u2014with faith; paray\u0101\u2014transcendental;\nupet\u0101\u1e25\u2014engages; te\u2014they; me\u2014Mine; yuktatam\u0101\u1e25\u2014most perfect; mat\u0101\u1e25\u2014I consider.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThe Blessed Lord said: He whose mind is fixed on My personal form, always\nengaged in worshiping Me with great and transcendental faith, is considered by\nMe to be most perfect.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nIn answer to Arjuna\u2019s question, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a clearly says that he who concentrates upon\nHis personal form and who worships Him with faith and devotion is to be\nconsidered most perfect in yoga. For one in such K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness there are\nno material activities because everything is done by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. A pure devotee is\nconstantly engaged\u2014sometimes he chants, sometimes he hears or reads books about\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or sometimes he cooks pras\u0101dam or goes to the marketplace to purchase\nsomething for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or sometimes he washes the temple or the dishes\u2014whatever he\ndoes, he does not let a single moment pass without devoting his activities to\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Such action is in full sam\u0101dhi.\n\n\n12.3-4\n\n\nye tv ak\u1e63aram anirde\u015byam\n\n\navyakta\u1e41 paryup\u0101sate\n\n\nsarvatra-gam acintya\u1e41 ca\n\n\nk\u016b\u1e6da-stham acala\u1e41 dhruvam\n\n\nsanniyamyendriya-gr\u0101ma\u1e41\n\n\nsarvatra sama-buddhaya\u1e25\n\n\nte pr\u0101pnuvanti m\u0101m eva\n\n\nsarva-bh\u016bta-hite rat\u0101\u1e25\n\n\nye\u2014those; tu\u2014but; ak\u1e63aram\u2014which is beyond the perception of the senses;\nanirde\u015byam\u2014indefinite; avyaktam\u2014unmanifested; paryup\u0101sate\u2014completely engages;\nsarvatra-gam\u2014all-pervading; acintyam\u2014inconceivable; ca\u2014also; k\u016b\u1e6dastham\u2014in the\ncenter; acalam\u2014immovable; dhruvam\u2014fixed; sanniyamya\u2014controlling;\nindriya-gr\u0101mam\u2014all the senses; sarvatra\u2014everywhere; sama-buddaya\u1e25\u2014equally\ndisposed; te\u2014they; pr\u0101pnuvanti\u2014achieve; m\u0101m\u2014unto Me; eva\u2014certainly;\nsarva-bh\u016bta-hite\u2014all living entities\u2019 welfare; rat\u0101\u1e25\u2014engaged.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nBut those who fully worship the unmanifested, that which lies beyond the\nperception of the senses, the all-pervading, inconceivable, fixed, and\nimmovable\u2014the impersonal conception of the Absolute Truth\u2014by controlling the\nvarious senses and being equally disposed to everyone, such persons, engaged in\nthe welfare of all, at last achieve Me.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThose who do not directly worship the Supreme Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but who attempt to\nachieve the same goal by an indirect process, also ultimately achieve the\nsupreme goal, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, as is stated, \u201cAfter many births the man of wisdom\nseeks refuge in Me, knowing V\u0101sudeva is all.\u201d When a person comes to full\nknowledge after many births, he surrenders unto Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. If one approaches\nthe Godhead by the method mentioned in this verse, he has to control the senses,\nrender service to everyone and engage in the welfare of all beings. It is\ninferred that one has to approach Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, otherwise there is no perfect\nrealization. Often there is much penance involved before one fully surrenders\nunto Him.\n\n\nIn order to perceive the Supersoul within the individual soul, one has to cease\nthe sensual activities of seeing, hearing, tasting, working, etc. Then one comes\nto understand that the Supreme Soul is present everywhere. Realizing this, one\nenvies no living entity\u2014he sees no difference between man and animal because he\nsees soul only, not the outer covering. But for the common man, this method of\nimpersonal realization is very difficult.\n\n\n12.5\n\n\nkle\u015bo \u2019dhikataras te\u1e63\u0101m\n\n\navyakt\u0101sakta-cetas\u0101m\n\n\navyakt\u0101 hi gatir du\u1e25kha\u1e41\n\n\ndehavadbhir av\u0101pyate\n\n\nkle\u015ba\u1e25\u2014trouble; adhikatara\u1e25\u2014more troublesome; te\u1e63\u0101m\u2014of them;\navyakta\u2014unmanifested; \u0101sakta\u2014being attached; cetas\u0101m\u2014of those whose minds;\navyakt\u0101\u2014unmanifested; hi\u2014certainly; gati\u1e25 du\u1e25kham\u2014progress is troublesome;\ndehavadbhi\u1e25\u2014of the embodiments; av\u0101pyate\u2014achieve.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nFor those whose minds are attached to the unmanifested, impersonal feature of\nthe Supreme, advancement is very troublesome. To make progrese in that\ndiscipline is always difficult for those who are embodied.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe group of transcendentalists who follow the path of the inconceivable,\nunmanifested, impersonal feature of the Supreme Lord are called j\u00f1\u0101na-yog\u012bs, and\npersons who are in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, engaged in devotional service to\nthe Lord, are called bhakti-yog\u012bs. Now, here the difference between j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga\nand bhakti-yoga is definitely expressed. The process of j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga, although\nultimately bringing one to the same goal, is very troublesome, whereas the path\nof bhakti-yoga, the process of being in direct service to the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead, is easier and is natural for the embodied soul. The\nindividual soul is embodied since time immemorial. It is very difficult for him\nto simply theoretically understand that he is not the body. Therefore, the\nbhakti-yog\u012b accepts the Deity of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as worshipable because there is some\nbodily conception fixed in the mind, which can thus be applied. Of course,\nworship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His form within the temple is\nnot idol worship. There is evidence in the Vedic literature that worship may be\nsagu\u1e47a and nirgu\u1e47a\u2014of the Supreme possessing or not possessing attributes.\nWorship of the Deity in the temple is sagu\u1e47a worship, for the Lord is\nrepresented by material qualities. But the form of the Lord, though represented\nby material qualities such as stone, wood, or oil paint, is not actually\nmaterial. That is the absolute nature of the Supreme Lord.\n\n\nA crude example may be given here. We may find some mailboxes on the street, and\nif we post our letters in those boxes, they will naturally go to their\ndestination without difficulty. But any old box, or an imitation, which we may\nfind somewhere, which is not authorized by the post office, will not do the\nwork. Similarly, God has an authorized representation in the Deity form, which\nis called arca-vigraha. This arca-vigraha is an incarnation of the Supreme Lord.\nGod will accept service through that form. The Lord is omnipotent and\nall-powerful; therefore, by His incarnation as arca-vigraha, He can accept the\nservices of the devotee, just to make it convenient for the man in conditioned\nlife.\n\n\nSo, for a devotee, there is no difficulty in approaching the Supreme immediately\nand directly, but for those who are following the impersonal way to spiritual\nrealization, the path is difficult. They have to understand the unmanifested\nrepresentation of the Supreme through such Vedic literatures as the Upani\u1e63ads,\nand they have to learn the language, understand the nonperceptual feelings, and\nthey have to realize all these processes. This is not very easy for a common\nman. A person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, engaged in devotional service, simply by\nthe guidance of the bona fide spiritual master, simply by offering regulative\nobeisances unto the Deity, simply by hearing the glories of the Lord, and simply\nby eating the remnants of foodstuffs offered to the Lord, realizes the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead very easily. There is no doubt that the impersonalists\nare unnecessarily taking a troublesome path with the risk of not realizing the\nAbsolute Truth at the ultimate end. But the personalist, without any risk,\ntrouble, or difficulty, approaches the Supreme Personality directly. A similar\npassage appears in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. It is stated there that if one has to\nultimately surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead (This surrendering\nprocess is called bhakti.), but instead takes the trouble to understand what is\nBrahman and what is not Brahman and spends his whole life in that way, the\nresult is simply troublesome. Therefore it is advised here that one should not\ntake up this troublesome path of self-realization because there is uncertainty\nin the ultimate result.\n\n\nA living entity is eternally an individual soul, and if he wants to merge into\nthe spiritual whole, he may accomplish the realization of the eternal and\nknowledgeable aspects of his original nature, but the blissful portion is not\nrealized. By the grace of some devotee, such a transcendentalist, highly learned\nin the process of j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga, may come to the point of bhakti-yoga, or\ndevotional service. At that time, long practice in impersonalism also becomes a\nsource of trouble, because he cannot give up the idea. Therefore an embodied\nsoul is always in difficulty with the unmanifest, both at the time of practice\nand at the time of realization. Every living soul is partially independant, and\none should know for certain that this unmanifested realization is against the\nnature of his spiritual blissful self. One should not take up this process. For\nevery individual living entity the process of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, which entails\nfull engagement in devotional service, is the best way. If one wants to ignore\nthis devotional service, there is the danger of turning to atheism. Thus this\nprocess of centering attention on the unmanifested, the inconceivable, which is\nbeyond the approach of the senses, as already expressed in this verse, should\nnever be encouraged at any time, especially in this age. It is not advised by\nLord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\n\n\n12.6-7\n\n\nye tu sarv\u0101\u1e47i karm\u0101\u1e47i\n\n\nmayi sannyasya mat-par\u0101\u1e25\n\n\nananyenaiva yogena\n\n\nm\u0101\u1e41 dhy\u0101yanta up\u0101sate\n\n\nte\u1e63\u0101m aha\u1e41 samuddhart\u0101\n\n\nm\u1e5btyu-sa\u1e41s\u0101ra-s\u0101gar\u0101t\n\n\nbhav\u0101mi na cir\u0101t p\u0101rtha\n\n\nmayy \u0101ve\u015bita-cetas\u0101m\n\n\nye\u2014one who; tu\u2014but; sarv\u0101\u1e47i\u2014everything; karm\u0101\u1e47i\u2014activities; mayi\u2014unto Me;\nsannyasya\u2014giving up; mat-par\u0101\u1e25\u2014being attached to Me; ananyena\u2014without division;\neva\u2014certainly; yogena\u2014by practice of such bhakti-yoga; m\u0101m\u2014unto Me;\ndhy\u0101yanta\u1e25\u2014meditating; up\u0101sate\u2014worship; te\u1e63\u0101m\u2014of them; aham\u2014I;\nsamuddhart\u0101\u2014deliverer; m\u1e5btyu\u2014that; sa\u1e41s\u0101ra\u2014material existence; s\u0101gar\u0101t\u2014from the\nocean; bhav\u0101mi\u2014become; na cir\u0101t\u2014not a long time; p\u0101rtha\u2014O son of P\u1e5bth\u0101;\nmayi\u2014unto Me; \u0101ve\u015bita\u2014fixed; cetas\u0101m\u2014of those whose minds are like that.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nFor one who worships Me, giving up all his activities unto Me and being devoted\nto Me without deviation, engaged in devotional service and always meditating\nupon Me, who has fixed his mind upon Me, O son of P\u1e5bth\u0101, for him I am the swift\ndeliverer from the ocean of birth and death.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nIt is explicitly stated here that the devotees are very fortunate to be\ndelivered very soon from material existence by the Lord. In pure devotional\nservice one comes to the realization that God is great and that the individual\nsoul is subordinate to Him. His duty is to render service to the Lord\u2014if not,\nthen he will render service to m\u0101y\u0101.\n\n\nAs stated before, the Supreme Lord can only be appreciated by devotional\nservice. Therefore, one should be fully devoted. One should fix his mind fully\non K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in order to achieve Him. One should work only for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. It does not\nmatter in what kind of work one engages, but that work should be done only for\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. That is the standard of devotional service. The devotee does not desire\nany achievement other than pleasing the Supreme Personality of Godhead. His\nlife\u2019s mission is to please K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and he can sacrifice everything for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s\nsatisfaction, just as Arjuna did in the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra. The process is\nvery simple: one can devote himself in his occupation and engage at the same\ntime in chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare\nR\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare. Such transcendental chanting attracts the devotee to\nthe Personality of Godhead.\n\n\nThe Supreme Lord herein promises that He will without delay deliver a pure\ndevotee thus engaged from the ocean of material existence. Those who are\nadvanced in yoga practice can willfully transfer the soul to whatever planet\nthey like by the yoga process, and others take the opportunity in various ways,\nbut as far as the devotee is concerned, it is clearly stated here that the Lord\nHimself takes him. He does not need to wait to become very experienced in order\nto transfer himself to the spiritual sky.\n\n\nIn the Var\u0101ha Pur\u0101\u1e47a this verse appears:\n\n\nnay\u0101mi parama\u1e41 sth\u0101nam arcir\u0101di-gati\u1e41 vin\u0101 garu\u1e0da-skandham \u0101ropya yatheccham\naniv\u0101rita\u1e25\n\n\nThe purport of this verse is that a devotee does not need to practice\na\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45ga-yoga in order to transfer his soul to the spiritual planets. The\nresponsibility is taken by the Supreme Lord Himself. He clearly states here that\nHe Himself becomes the deliverer. A child is completely cared for by his\nparents, and thus his position is secure. Similarly, a devotee does not need to\nendeavor to transfer himself by yoga practice to other planets. Rather, the\nSupreme Lord, by His great mercy, comes at once, riding on His bird carrier\nGaru\u1e0da, and at once delivers the devotee from this material existence. Although\na man who has fallen in the ocean may struggle very hard and may be very expert\nin swimming, he cannot save himself. But if someone comes and picks him up from\nthe water, then he is easily rescued. Similarly, the Lord picks up the devotee\nfrom this material existence. One simply has to practice the easy process of\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and fully engage himself in devotional service. Any\nintelligent man should always prefer the process of devotional service to all\nother paths. In the N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47\u012bya this is confirmed as follows:\n\n\ny\u0101 vai s\u0101dhana-sampatti-puru\u1e63\u0101rtha-catu\u1e63\u1e6daye tay\u0101 vin\u0101 tad-\u0101pnoti naro\nn\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47\u0101\u015braya\u1e25\n\n\nThe purport of this verse is that one should not engage in the different\nprocesses of fruitive activity or cultivate knowledge by the mental speculative\nprocess. One who is devoted to the Supreme Personality can attain all the\nbenefits derived from other yogic processes, speculation, rituals, sacrifices,\ncharities, etc. That is the specific benediction of devotional service.\n\n\nSimply by chanting the holy name of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2014Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a,\nHare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare\u2014a devotee of the Lord can\napproach the supreme destination easily and happily, but this destination cannot\nbe approached by any other process of religion.\n\n\nThe conclusion of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is stated in the Eighteenth Chapter:\n\n\nsarva-dharm\u0101n parityajya m\u0101m eka\u1e41 \u015bara\u1e47a\u1e41 vraja aha\u1e41 tv\u0101\u1e41 sarva-p\u0101pebhyo\nmok\u1e63ayi\u1e63y\u0101mi m\u0101 \u015buca\u1e25.\n\n\nOne should give up all other processes of self-realization and simply execute\ndevotional service in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. That will enable one to reach the\nhighest perfection of life. There is no need for one to consider the sinful\nactions of his past life because the Supreme Lord fully takes charge of him.\nTherefore one should not futilely try to deliver himself in spiritual\nrealization. Let everyone take shelter of the supreme omnipotent Godhead K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\nThat is the highest perfection of life.\n\n\n12.8\n\n\nmayy eva mana \u0101dhatsva\n\n\nmayi buddhi\u1e41 nive\u015baya\n\n\nnivasi\u1e63yasi mayy eva\n\n\nata \u016brdhva\u1e41 na sa\u1e41\u015baya\u1e25\n\n\nmayi\u2014unto Me; eva\u2014certainly; mana\u1e25\u2014mind; \u0101dhatsva\u2014fix; mayi\u2014upon Me;\nbuddhim\u2014intelligence; nive\u015baya\u2014apply; nivasi\u1e63yasi\u2014you lead; mayi\u2014unto Me;\neva\u2014certainly; ata\u1e25\u2014therefore; \u016brdhvam\u2014up; na\u2014never; sa\u1e41\u015baya\u1e25\u2014doubt.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nJust fix your mind upon Me, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and engage all\nyour intelligence in Me.

A devotee does not live on the material\nplane\u2014he lives in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The holy name of the Lord and the Lord are\nnondifferent; therefore when a devotee chants Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and His internal\npotency are dancing on the tongue of the devotee. When he offers K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a food,\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a directly accepts these eatables, and the devotee becomes K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-ized by\neating the remnants. One who does not engage in such service cannot understand\nhow this is so, although this is a process recommended in the G\u012bt\u0101 and in other\nVedic literatures.\n\n\n12.9\n\n\natha citta\u1e41 sam\u0101dh\u0101tu\u1e41\n\n\nna \u015bakno\u1e63i mayi sthiram\n\n\nabhy\u0101sa-yogena tato\n\n\nm\u0101m icch\u0101ptu\u1e41 dhana\u00f1jaya\n\n\natha\u2014if, therefore; cittam\u2014mind; sam\u0101dh\u0101tam\u2014fixing; na\u2014not; \u015bakno\u1e63i\u2014able;\nmayi\u2014upon Me; sthiram\u2014fixed; abhy\u0101sa\u2014practice; yogena\u2014by devotional service;\ntata\u1e25\u2014therefore; m\u0101m\u2014Me; icch\u0101\u2014desire; \u0101ptum\u2014to get; dhana\u00f1jaya\u2014O Arjuna.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nMy dear Arjuna, O winner of wealth, if you cannot fix your mind upon Me without\ndeviation, then follow the regulated principles of bhakti-yoga In this way you\nwill develop a desire to attain to Me.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nIn this verse, two different processes of bhakti-yoga are indicated. The first\napplies to one who has actually developed an attachment for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead, by transcendental love. And the other is for one who has\nnot developed an attachment for the Supreme Person by transcendental love. For\nthis second class there are different prescribed rules and regulations, which\none can follow to be ultimately elevated to the stage of attachment to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\n\n\nBhakti-yoga is the purification of the senses. At the present moment in material\nexistence the senses are always impure, being engaged in sense gratification.\nBut, by the practice of bhakti-yoga these senses can become purified, and in the\npurified state they come directly in contact with the Supreme Lord. In this\nmaterial existence, I may be engaged in some service to some master, but I don\u2019t\nreally lovingly serve my master. I simply serve to get some money. And the\nmaster also is not in love; he takes service from me and pays me. So there is no\nquestion of love. But for spiritual life, one must be elevated to the pure stage\nof love. That stage of love can be achieved by practice of devotional service,\nperformed with the present senses.\n\n\nThis love of God is now in a dormant state in everyone\u2019s heart. And, there, love\nof God is manifested in different ways, but it is contaminated by the material\nassociation. Now the material association has to be purified, and that dormant,\nnatural love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has to be revived. That is the whole process.\n\n\nTo practice the regulative principles of bhakti-yoga one should, under the\nguidance of an expert spiritual master, follow certain principles: one should\nrise early in the morning, take bath, enter the temple and offer prayers and\nchant Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, then collect flowers to offer to the Deity, cook foodstuffs to\noffer to the Deity, take pras\u0101dam, and so on. There are various rules and\nregulations which one should follow. And one should constantly hear\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam from pure devotees. This practice can help\nanyone to rise to the level of love of God, and then he is sure of his progress\ninto the spiritual kingdom of God. This practice of bhakti-yoga, under the rules\nand regulations, with the direction of a spiritual master, will surely bring one\nto the stage of love of God.\n\n\n12.10\n\n\nabhy\u0101se \u2019py asamartho \u2019si\n\n\nmat-karma-paramo bhava\n\n\nmad-artham api karm\u0101\u1e47i\n\n\nkurvan siddhim av\u0101psyasi\n\n\nabhy\u0101se\u2014in the practice of; api\u2014even; asamartha\u1e25\u2014unable; asi\u2014you are;\nmat-karma\u2014My work; parama\u1e25\u2014supreme; bhava\u2014you become; mat-artham\u2014for My sake;\napi\u2014even though; karm\u0101\u1e47i\u2014what; kurvan\u2014performing; siddhim\u2014perfection;\nav\u0101psyasi\u2014achieve.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nIf you cannot practice the regulations of bhakti-yoga, then just try to work for\nMe, because by working for Me you will come to the perfect stage.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nOne who is not able even to practice the regulative principles of bhakti-yoga,\nunder the guidance of a spiritual master, can still be drawn to this\nperfectional stage by working for the Supreme Lord. How to do this work has\nalready been explained in the fifty-fifth verse of the Eleventh Chapter. One\nshould be sympathetic to the propagation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. There are many\ndevotees who are engaged in the propagation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, and they\nrequire help. So, even if one cannot directly practice the regulated principles\nof bhakti-yoga, he can try to help such work. Every endeavor requires land,\ncapital, organization, and labor. Just as, in business, one requires a place to\nstay, some capital to use, some labor, and some organization to expand, so the\nsame is required in the service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The only difference is that in\nmaterialism one works for sense gratification. The same work, however, can be\nperformed for the satisfaction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and that is spiritual activity. If one\nhas sufficient money, he can help in building an office or temple for\npropagating K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Or he can help with publications. There are\nvarious fields of activity, and one should be interested in such activities. If\none cannot sacrifice the result of such activities, the same person can still\nsacrifice some percentage to propagate K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. This voluntary\nservice to the cause of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness will help one to rise to a higher\nstate of love for God, whereupon one becomes perfect.\n\n\n12.11\n\n\nathaitad apy a\u015bakto \u2019si\n\n\nkartu\u1e41 mad-yogam \u0101\u015brita\u1e25\n\n\nsarva-karma-phala-ty\u0101ga\u1e41\n\n\ntata\u1e25 kuru yat\u0101tmav\u0101n\n\n\natha\u2014even though; etat\u2014this; api\u2014also; a\u015bakta\u1e25\u2014unable; asi\u2014you are; kartum\u2014to\nperform; mat\u2014unto Me; yogam\u2014devotional service; \u0101\u015brita\u1e25\u2014refuge; sarva-karma\u2014all\nactivities; phala\u2014result; ty\u0101gam\u2014for renunciation; tata\u1e25\u2014therefore; kuru\u2014do;\nyata-\u0101tmavan\u2014self-situated.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nIf, however, you are unable to work in this consciousness, then try to act\ngiving up all results of your work and try to be self-situated.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nIt may be that one is unable to even sympathize with the activities of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness because of social, familial or religious considerations or because\nof some other impediments. If one attaches himself directly to the activities of\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, there may be objection from family members, or so many\nother difficulties. For one who has such a problem, it is advised that he\nsacrifice the accumulated result of his activities to some good cause. Such\nprocedures are described in the Vedic rules. There are many descriptions of\nsacrifices and special functions of the pumundi or special work in which the\nresult of one\u2019s previous action may be applied. Thus one may gradually become\nelevated to the state of knowledge. It is also found that when one who is not\neven interested in the activities of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness gives charity to some\nhospital or some other social institution, he gives up the hard-earned results\nof his activities. That is also recommended here because by the practice of\ngiving up the fruits of one\u2019s activities one is sure to purify his mind\ngradually, and in that purified stage of mind one becomes able to understand\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Of course K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is not dependant on any other\nexperience because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness itself can purify one\u2019s mind, but if\nthere are impediments to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, one may try to give up the result\nof his action. In that respect, social service, community service, national\nservice, sacrifice for one\u2019s country, etc., may be accepted so that some day one\nmay come to the stage of pure devotional service to the Supreme Lord. In\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 we find it is stated: yata\u1e25 prav\u1e5bttir bh\u016bt\u0101n\u0101m: If one decides to\nsacrifice for the supreme cause, even if he does not know that the supreme cause\nis K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he will come gradually to understand that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the supreme cause\nby the sacrificial method.\n\n\n12.12\n\n\n\u015breyo hi j\u00f1\u0101nam abhy\u0101s\u0101j\n\n\nj\u00f1\u0101n\u0101d dhy\u0101na\u1e41 vi\u015bi\u1e63yate\n\n\ndhy\u0101n\u0101t karma-phala-ty\u0101gas\n\n\nty\u0101g\u0101c ch\u0101ntir anantaram\n\n\n\u015breya\u1e25\u2014better; hi\u2014certainly; j\u00f1\u0101nam\u2014knowledge; abhy\u0101s\u0101t\u2014by practice;\njn\u0101n\u0101t\u2014better than knowledge; dhy\u0101nam\u2014meditation; vi\u015bi\u1e63yate\u2014especially\nconsidered; dhy\u0101n\u0101t\u2014from meditation; karma-phala-ty\u0101ga\u1e25\u2014renunciation of the\nresults of fruitive action; ty\u0101g\u0101t\u2014by such renunciation; \u015b\u0101nti\u1e25\u2014peace;\nanantaram\u2014thereafter.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nIf you cannot take to this practice, then engage yourself in the cultivation of\nknowledge. Better than knowledge, however, is meditation, and better than\nmeditation is renunciation of the fruits of action, for by such renunciation one\ncan attain peace of mind.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nAs mentioned in the previous verses, there are two kinds of devotional service:\nthe way of regulated principles, and the way of full attachment in love to the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead. For those who are actually not able to follow\nthe principles of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, it is better to cultivate knowledge\nbecause by knowledge one can be able to understand his real position. Gradually\nknowledge will develop to the point of meditation. By meditation one can be able\nto understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead by a gradual process. There are\nprocesses which make one understand that one himself is the Supreme, and that\nsort of meditation is preferred if one is unable to engage in devotional\nservice. If one is not able to meditate in such a way, then there are prescribed\nduties, as enjoined in the Vedic literature, for the br\u0101hma\u1e47as, vai\u015byas, and\n\u015b\u016bdras, which we shall find in a later chapter of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. But in all\ncases, one should give up the result or fruits of labor; this means to employ\nthe result of karma for some good cause. In summary, to reach the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead, the highest goal, there are two processes: one process\nis by gradual development, and the other process is direct. Devotional service\nin K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is the direct method, and the other method involves\nrenouncing the fruits of one\u2019s activities. Then one can come to the stage of\nknowledge, then to the stage of meditation, then to the stage of understanding\nthe Supersoul, and then to the stage of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One\nmay either take the step by step process or the direct path. The direct process\nis not possible for everyone; therefore the indirect process is also good. It\nis, however, to be understood that the indirect process is not recommended for\nArjuna because he is already at the stage of loving devotional service to the\nSupreme Lord. It is for others who are not at this state; for them the gradual\nprocess of renunciation, knowledge, meditation and realization of the Supersoul\nand Brahman should be followed. But as far as Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is concerned, it is\nthe direct method that is stressed. Everyone is advised to take to the direct\nmethod and surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\n\n\n12.13-14\n\n\nadve\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101 sarva-bh\u016bt\u0101n\u0101\u1e41\n\n\nmaitra\u1e25 karu\u1e47a eva ca\n\n\nnirmamo niraha\u1e45k\u0101ra\u1e25\n\n\nsama-du\u1e25kha-sukha\u1e25 k\u1e63am\u012b\n\n\nsantu\u1e63\u1e6da\u1e25 satata\u1e41 yog\u012b\n\n\nyat\u0101tm\u0101 d\u1e5b\u1e0dha-ni\u015bcaya\u1e25\n\n\nmayy arpita-mano-buddhir\n\n\nyo mad-bhakta\u1e25 sa me priya\u1e25\n\n\nadve\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u2014not envious; sarva-bh\u016bt\u0101n\u0101m\u2014for all living entities; maitra\u1e25\u2014friendly;\nkaru\u1e47a\u1e25\u2014kindly; eva\u2014certainly; ca\u2014also; nirmama\u1e25\u2014with no sense of\nproprietorship; niraha\u1e45k\u0101ra\u1e25\u2014without false ego; sama\u2014equally; du\u1e25kha\u1e25\u2014distress;\nsukha\u1e25\u2014happiness; k\u1e63am\u012b\u2014forgiving; santu\u1e63\u1e6da\u1e25\u2014satisfied; satatam\u2014satisfied;\nyog\u012b\u2014engaged in devotion; yat\u0101-atm\u0101\u2014endeavoring; d\u1e5bd\u1e25ani\u015bcaya\u1e25\u2014with\ndetermination; mayi\u2014upon Me; arpita\u2014engaged; mana\u1e25\u2014mind; buddhi\u1e25\u2014intelligent;\nya\u1e25\u2014one who; mat-bhakta\u1e25\u2014My devotee; sa\u1e25 me priya\u1e25\u2014he is dear to Me.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nOne who is not envious but who is a kind friend to all living entities, who does\nnot think himself a proprietor, who is free from false ego and equal both in\nhappiness and distress, who is always satisfied and engaged in devotional\nservice with determination and whose mind and intelligence are in agreement with\nMe\u2014he is very dear to Me.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nComing again to the point of pure devotional service, the Lord is describing the\ntranscendental qualifications of a pure devotee in these two verses. A pure\ndevotee is never disturbed in any circumstances. Nor is he envious of anyone.\nNor does a devotee become his enemy\u2019s enemy; he thinks that one is acting as his\nenemy due to his own past misdeeds. Thus it is better to suffer than to protest.\nIn the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam it is stated: tat te \u2019nukamp\u0101\u1e41 su-sam\u012bk\u1e63yama\u1e47o.\nWhenever a devotee is in distress or has fallen into difficulty, he thinks that\nit is the Lord\u2019s mercy upon him. He thinks: \u201cThanks to my past misdeeds I should\nsuffer far, far greater than I am suffering now. So it is by the mercy of the\nSupreme Lord that I am not getting all the punishment I am due. I am just\ngetting a little, by the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\u201d Therefore\nhe is always calm, quiet and patient, despite many distressful conditions. A\ndevotee is also always kind to everyone, even to his enemy. Nirmama means that a\ndevotee does not attach much importance to the peace and trouble pertaining to\nthe body because he knows perfectly well that he is not the material body. He\ndoes not identify with the body; therefore he is freed from the conception of\nfalse ego and is equiposed both in happiness and distress. He is tolerant, and\nhe is satisfied with whatever comes by the grace of the Supreme Lord. He does\nnot endeavor much to achieve something with great difficulty; therefore he is\nalways joyful. He is a completely perfect mystic because he is fixed in the\ninstructions received from the spiritual master, and because his senses are\ncontrolled, he is determined. He is not swayed by false argument because no one\ncan lead him from the fixed determination of devotional service. He is fully\nconscious that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the eternal Lord, so no one can disturb him. All his\nqualifications enable him to depend entirely on the Supreme Lord. Such a\nstandard of devotional service is undoubtably very rare, but a devotee becomes\nsituated in that stage by following the regulative principles of devotional\nservice. Furthermore, the Lord says that such a devotee is very dear to Him, for\nthe Lord is always pleased with all his activities in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\n\n\n12.15\n\n\nyasm\u0101n nodvijate loko\n\n\nlok\u0101n nodvijate ca ya\u1e25\n\n\nhar\u1e63\u0101mar\u1e63a-bhayodvegair\n\n\nmukto ya\u1e25 sa ca me priya\u1e25\n\n\nyasm\u0101t\u2014from whom; na\u2014never; udvijate\u2014ag\u012bt\u0101tes; loka\u1e25\u2014persons; lok\u0101t\u2014persons;\nna\u2014never; advijate\u2014disturbed; ca\u2014also; ya\u1e25\u2014anyone; har\u1e63a\u2014happiness;\namar\u1e63a\u2014distress; bhaya\u2014fearfulness; udvegai\u1e25\u2014with anxiety; mukta\u1e25\u2014freed;\nya\u1e25\u2014who; sa\u1e25\u2014anyone; ca\u2014also; me\u2014My; priya\u1e25\u2014very dear.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nHe for whom no one is put into difficulty and who is not dirturbed by anxiety,\nwho is steady in happiness and distress, is very dear to Me.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nA few of a devotee\u2019s qualifications are further being described. No one is put\ninto difficulty, anxiety, fearfulness, or dissatisfaction by such a devotee.\nSince a devotee is kind to everyone, he does not act in such a way to put others\ninto anxiety. At the same time, if others try to put a devotee into anxiety, he\nis not disturbed. It is by the grace of the Lord that he is so practiced that he\nis not disturbed by any outward disturbance. Actually because a devotee is\nalways engrossed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and engaged in devotional service, all\nsuch material circumstances cannot woo him. Generally a materialistic person\nbecomes very happy when there is something for his sense gratification and his\nbody, but when he sees that others have something for their sense gratification\nand he hasn\u2019t, he is sorry and envious. When he is expecting some retaliation\nfrom an enemy, he is in a state of fear, and when he cannot successfully execute\nsomething he becomes dejected. But a devotee is always transcendental to all\nthese disturbances; therefore he is very dear to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\n\n\n12.16\n\n\nanapek\u1e63a\u1e25 \u015bucir dak\u1e63a\n\n\nud\u0101s\u012bno gata-vyatha\u1e25\n\n\nsarv\u0101rambha-parity\u0101g\u012b\n\n\nyo mad-bhakta\u1e25 sa me priya\u1e25\n\n\nanapek\u1e63a\u1e25\u2014neutral; \u015buci\u1e25\u2014pure; dak\u1e63a\u1e25\u2014expert; ud\u0101s\u012bna\u1e25\u2014free from care;\ngata-vyatha\u1e25\u2014freed from all distress; sarva-\u0101rambha\u2014all endeavors;\nparity\u0101g\u012b\u2014renouncer; ya\u1e25\u2014anyone; mat-bhakta\u1e25\u2014My devotee; sa\u1e25\u2014he; me\u2014Me;\npriya\u1e25\u2014very dear\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nA devotee who is not dependant on the ordinary course of activities, who is\npure, expert, without cares, free from all pains, and who does not strive for\nsome result, is very dear to Me.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nMoney may be offered to a devotee, but he should not struggle to acquire it. If\nautomatically, by the grace of the Supreme, money comes to him, he is not\nag\u012bt\u0101ted. Naturally a devotee takes bath at least twice in a day and rises early\nin the morning for devotional service. Thus he is naturally clean both inwardly\nand outwardly. A devotee is always expert because he fully knows the sense of\nall activities of life, and he is convinced of the authoritative scriptures. A\ndevotee never takes the part of a particular party; therefore he is carefree. He\nis never pained because he is free from all designations; he knows that his body\nis a designation, so if there are some bodily pains, he is free. The pure\ndevotee does not endeavor for anything which is against the principles of\ndevotional service. For example, constructing a big building requires great\nenergy, and a devotee does not take to such business if it does not benefit him\nby advancing his devotional service. He may construct a temple for the Lord, and\nfor that he may take all kinds of anxiety, but he does not construct a big house\nfor his personal relations.\n\n\n12.17\n\n\nyo na h\u1e5b\u1e63yati na dve\u1e63\u1e6di\n\n\nna \u015bocati na k\u0101\u1e45k\u1e63ati\n\n\n\u015bubh\u0101\u015bubha-parity\u0101g\u012b\n\n\nbhaktim\u0101n ya\u1e25 sa me priya\u1e25\n\n\nya\u1e25\u2014one who: na\u2014never; h\u1e5b\u1e63yati\u2014takes pleasure; na\u2014never; dve\u1e63\u1e6di\u2014grieves;\nna\u2014never; \u015bocati\u2014laments; na\u2014never; k\u0101\u1e45k\u1e63ati\u2014desires; \u015bubha\u2014auspicious;\na\u015bubha\u2014inauspicious; parity\u0101g\u012b\u2014renouncer; bhaktim\u0101n\u2014devotee; ya\u1e25\u2014one who; sa\u1e25\u2014he\nis; me\u2014My; priya\u1e25\u2014dear.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nOne who neither grasps pleasure or grief, who neither laments nor desires, and\nwho renounces both auspicious and inauspicious things, is very dear to Me.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nA pure devotee is neither happy nor distressed over material gain and loss, nor\nis he very much anxious to get a son or disciple, nor is he distressed by not\ngetting them. If he loses anything which is very dear to him, he does not\nlament. Similarly, if he does not get what he desires, he is not distressed. He\nis transcendental in the face of all kinds of auspicious, inauspicious and\nsinful activities. He is prepared to accept all kinds of risks for the\nsatisfaction of the Supreme Lord. Nothing is an impediment in the discharge of\nhis devotional service.

Sometimes one is praised and\nsometimes one is defamed; that is the nature of human society. But a devotee is\nalways transcendental to artificial fame and infamy, distress or happiness. He\nis very patient. He does not speak of anything but the topics about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a;\ntherefore he is called silent. Silent does not mean that one should not speak;\nsilent means that one should not speak nonsense. One should speak only of\nessentials, and the most essential speech for the devotee is to speak of the\nSupreme Lord. He is happy in all conditions; sometimes he may get very palatable\nfoodstuffs, sometimes not, but he is satisfied. Nor does he care for any\nresidential facility. He may sometimes live underneath a tree, and he may\nsometimes live in a very palatial building; he is attracted to neither. He is\ncalled fixed because he is fixed in his determination and knowledge. We may find\nsome repetition in the descriptions of the qualifications of a devotee, but this\nis just to give an illustration of the fact that a devotee must acquire all\nthese qualifications. Without good qualifications, one cannot be a pure devotee.\nOne who is not a devotee has no good qualification. One who wants to be\nrecognized as a devotee should develop the good qualifications. Of course he\ndoes not extraneously endeavor to acquire these qualifications, but engagement\nin K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and devotional service automatically helps him develop\nthem.\n\n\n12.20\n\n\nye tu dharm\u0101m\u1e5btam ida\u1e41\n\n\nyathokta\u1e41 paryup\u0101sate\n\n\n\u015braddadh\u0101n\u0101 mat-param\u0101\n\n\nbhakt\u0101s te \u2019t\u012bva me priy\u0101\u1e25\n\n\nye\u2014one who; tu\u2014but; dharmya\u2014generosity; am\u1e5btam\u2014understanding; idam\u2014this;\nyath\u0101\u2014as; uktam\u2014said; paryup\u0101sate\u2014completely engages; sraddadh\u0101n\u0101\u1e25\u2014with faith;\nmat-param\u0101\u1e25\u2014taking the Supreme Lord as everything; bhakt\u0101\u1e25\u2014devotees; te\u2014such\npersons; at\u012bva\u2014very, very; me\u2014Me; priy\u0101\u1e25\u2014dear.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nHe who follows this imperishable path of devotional service and who completely\nengages himself with faith, making Me the supreme goal, is very, very dear to\nMe.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nIn this chapter the religion of eternal engagement, the explanation of the\nprocess of transcendental service for approaching the Supreme Lord, is given.\nThis process is very dear to the Lord, and He accepts a person who is engaged in\nsuch a process. The question who is better\u2014one who is engaged in the path of\nimpersonal Brahman or one who is engaged in the personal service of the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead\u2014was raised by Arjuna, and the Lord replied to him so\nexplicitly that there is no doubt that devotional service to the Personality of\nGodhead is the best of all processes of spiritual realization. In other words,\nin this chapter it is decided that through good association, one develops\nattachment for pure devotional service and thereby accepts a bona fide spiritual\nmaster and from him begins to hear and chant and observe the regulative\nprinciples of devotional service with faith, attachment and devotion and thus\nbecomes engaged in the transcendental service of the Lord. This path is\nrecommended in this chapter; therefore there is no doubt that devotional service\nis the only absolute path for self-realization, for the attainment of the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead. The impersonal conception of the Supreme\nAbsolute Truth, as described in this chapter, is recommended only up to the time\none surrenders himself for self-realization. In other words, as long as one does\nnot have the chance to associate with a pure devotee, the impersonal conception\nmay be beneficial. In the impersonal conception of the Absolute Truth one works\nwithout fruitive result, meditates and cultivates knowledge to understand spirit\nand matter. This is necessary as long as one is not in the association of a pure\ndevotee. Fortunately, if one develops directly a desire to engage in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness in pure devotional service, he does not need to undergo step by\nstep improvements in spiritual realization. Devotional service, as described in\nthe middle six chapters of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, is more congenial. One need not bother\nabout materials to keep body and soul together because by the grace of the Lord\neverything is carried out automatically.",

TRANSLATION  Arjuna inquired: Which is considered to be more perfect: those who are properly\nengaged in Your devotional service, or those who worship the impersonal Brahman,\nthe unmanifested?  PURPORT  K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has now explained about the personal, the impersonal and the universal and\nhas described all kinds of devotees and yog\u012bs. Generally, the transcendentalists\ncan be divided into two classes. One is the impersonalist, and the other is the\npersonalist. The personalist devotee engages himself with all energy in the\nservice of the Supreme Lord. The impersonalist engages himself not directly in\nthe service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a but in meditation on the impersonal Brahman, the\nunmanifested.  We find in this chapter that of the different processes for realization of the\nAbsolute Truth, bhakti-yoga, devotional service, is the highest. If one at all\ndesires to have the association of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, then he\nmust take to devotional service.  Those who worship the Supreme Lord directly by devotional service are called\npersonalists. Those who engage themselves in meditation on the impersonal\nBrahman are called impersonalists. Arjuna is here questioning which position is\nbetter. There are different ways to realize the Absolute Truth, but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nindicates in this chapter that bhakti-yoga, or devotional service to Him, is\nhighest of all. It is the most direct, and it is the easiest means for\nassociation with the Godhead.  In the Second Chapter the Lord explains that a living entity is not the material\nbody but is a spiritual spark, a part of the Absolute Truth. In the Seventh\nChapter He speaks of the living entity as part and parcel of the supreme whole\nand recommends that he transfer his attention fully to the whole. In the Eighth\nChapter it is stated that whoever thinks of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a at the moment of death is at\nonce transferred to the spiritual sky, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s abode. And at the end of the\nSixth Chapter the Lord says that out of all the yog\u012bs, he who thinks of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nwithin himself is considered to be the most perfect. So throughout the G\u012bt\u0101\npersonal devotion to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is recommended as the highest form of spiritual\nrealization. Yet there are those who are still attracted to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s impersonal\nbrahmajyoti effulgence, which is the all-pervasive aspect of the Absolute Truth\nand which is unmanifest and beyond the reach of the senses. Arjuna would like to\nknow which of these two types of transcendentalists is more perfect in\nknowledge. In other words, he is clarifying his own position because he is\nattached to the personal form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He is not attached to the impersonal\nBrahman. He wants to know whether his position is secure. The impersonal\nmanifestation, either in this material world or in the spiritual world of the\nSupreme Lord, is a problem for meditation. Actually, one cannot perfectly\nconceive of the impersonal feature of the Absolute Truth. Therefore Arjuna wants\nto say, \u201cWhat is the use of such a waste of time?\u201d Arjuna experienced in the\nEleventh Chapter that to be attached to the personal form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is best\nbecause he could thus understand all other forms at the same time and there was\nno disturbance to his love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This important question asked of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by\nArjuna will clarify the distinction between the impersonal and personal\nconceptions of the Absolute Truth.",

For one in such K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness there are\nno material activities because everything is done by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.

TRANSLATION  For those whose minds are attached to the unmanifested, impersonal feature of\nthe Supreme, advancement is very troublesome. To make progrese in that\ndiscipline is always difficult for those who are embodied.  PURPORT  The group of transcendentalists who follow the path of the inconceivable,\nunmanifested, impersonal feature of the Supreme Lord are called j\u00f1\u0101na-yog\u012bs, and\npersons who are in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, engaged in devotional service to\nthe Lord, are called bhakti-yog\u012bs. Now, here the difference between j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga\nand bhakti-yoga is definitely expressed. The process of j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga, although\nultimately bringing one to the same goal, is very troublesome, whereas the path\nof bhakti-yoga, the process of being in direct service to the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead, is easier and is natural for the embodied soul. The\nindividual soul is embodied since time immemorial. It is very difficult for him\nto simply theoretically understand that he is not the body. Therefore, the\nbhakti-yog\u012b accepts the Deity of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as worshipable because there is some\nbodily conception fixed in the mind, which can thus be applied. Of course,\nworship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His form within the temple is\nnot idol worship. There is evidence in the Vedic literature that worship may be\nsagu\u1e47a and nirgu\u1e47a\u2014of the Supreme possessing or not possessing attributes.\nWorship of the Deity in the temple is sagu\u1e47a worship, for the Lord is\nrepresented by material qualities. But the form of the Lord, though represented\nby material qualities such as stone, wood, or oil paint, is not actually\nmaterial. That is the absolute nature of the Supreme Lord.  A crude example may be given here. We may find some mailboxes on the street, and\nif we post our letters in those boxes, they will naturally go to their\ndestination without difficulty. But any old box, or an imitation, which we may\nfind somewhere, which is not authorized by the post office, will not do the\nwork. Similarly, God has an authorized representation in the Deity form, which\nis called arca-vigraha. This arca-vigraha is an incarnation of the Supreme Lord.\nGod will accept service through that form. The Lord is omnipotent and\nall-powerful; therefore, by His incarnation as arca-vigraha, He can accept the\nservices of the devotee, just to make it convenient for the man in conditioned\nlife.  So, for a devotee, there is no difficulty in approaching the Supreme immediately\nand directly, but for those who are following the impersonal way to spiritual\nrealization, the path is difficult. They have to understand the unmanifested\nrepresentation of the Supreme through such Vedic literatures as the Upani\u1e63ads,\nand they have to learn the language, understand the nonperceptual feelings, and\nthey have to realize all these processes. This is not very easy for a common\nman. A person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, engaged in devotional service, simply by\nthe guidance of the bona fide spiritual master, simply by offering regulative\nobeisances unto the Deity, simply by hearing the glories of the Lord, and simply\nby eating the remnants of foodstuffs offered to the Lord, realizes the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead very easily. There is no doubt that the impersonalists\nare unnecessarily taking a troublesome path with the risk of not realizing the\nAbsolute Truth at the ultimate end. But the personalist, without any risk,\ntrouble, or difficulty, approaches the Supreme Personality directly. A similar\npassage appears in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. It is stated there that if one has to\nultimately surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead (This surrendering\nprocess is called bhakti.), but instead takes the trouble to understand what is\nBrahman and what is not Brahman and spends his whole life in that way, the\nresult is simply troublesome. Therefore it is advised here that one should not\ntake up this troublesome path of self-realization because there is uncertainty\nin the ultimate result.  A living entity is eternally an individual soul, and if he wants to merge into\nthe spiritual whole, he may accomplish the realization of the eternal and\nknowledgeable aspects of his original nature, but the blissful portion is not\nrealized. By the grace of some devotee, such a transcendentalist, highly learned\nin the process of j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga, may come to the point of bhakti-yoga, or\ndevotional service. At that time, long practice in impersonalism also becomes a\nsource of trouble, because he cannot give up the idea. Therefore an embodied\nsoul is always in difficulty with the unmanifest, both at the time of practice\nand at the time of realization. Every living soul is partially independant, and\none should know for certain that this unmanifested realization is against the\nnature of his spiritual blissful self. One should not take up this process. For\nevery individual living entity the process of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, which entails\nfull engagement in devotional service, is the best way. If one wants to ignore\nthis devotional service, there is the danger of turning to atheism. Thus this\nprocess of centering attention on the unmanifested, the inconceivable, which is\nbeyond the approach of the senses, as already expressed in this verse, should\nnever be encouraged at any time, especially in this age. It is not advised by\nLord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",

TRANSLATION  For one who worships Me, giving up all his activities unto Me and being devoted\nto Me without deviation, engaged in devotional service and always meditating\nupon Me, who has fixed his mind upon Me, O son of P\u1e5bth\u0101, for him I am the swift\ndeliverer from the ocean of birth and death.  PURPORT  It is explicitly stated here that the devotees are very fortunate to be\ndelivered very soon from material existence by the Lord. In pure devotional\nservice one comes to the realization that God is great and that the individual\nsoul is subordinate to Him. His duty is to render service to the Lord\u2014if not,\nthen he will render service to m\u0101y\u0101.  As stated before, the Supreme Lord can only be appreciated by devotional\nservice. Therefore, one should be fully devoted. One should fix his mind fully\non K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in order to achieve Him. One should work only for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. It does not\nmatter in what kind of work one engages, but that work should be done only for\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. That is the standard of devotional service. The devotee does not desire\nany achievement other than pleasing the Supreme Personality of Godhead. His\nlife\u2019s mission is to please K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and he can sacrifice everything for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s\nsatisfaction, just as Arjuna did in the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra. The process is\nvery simple: one can devote himself in his occupation and engage at the same\ntime in chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare\nR\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare. Such transcendental chanting attracts the devotee to\nthe Personality of Godhead.  The Supreme Lord herein promises that He will without delay deliver a pure\ndevotee thus engaged from the ocean of material existence. Those who are\nadvanced in yoga practice can willfully transfer the soul to whatever planet\nthey like by the yoga process, and others take the opportunity in various ways,\nbut as far as the devotee is concerned, it is clearly stated here that the Lord\nHimself takes him. He does not need to wait to become very experienced in order\nto transfer himself to the spiritual sky.  In the Var\u0101ha Pur\u0101\u1e47a this verse appears:  nay\u0101mi parama\u1e41 sth\u0101nam arcir\u0101di-gati\u1e41 vin\u0101 garu\u1e0da-skandham \u0101ropya yatheccham\naniv\u0101rita\u1e25  The purport of this verse is that a devotee does not need to practice\na\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45ga-yoga in order to transfer his soul to the spiritual planets. The\nresponsibility is taken by the Supreme Lord Himself. He clearly states here that\nHe Himself becomes the deliverer. A child is completely cared for by his\nparents, and thus his position is secure. Similarly, a devotee does not need to\nendeavor to transfer himself by yoga practice to other planets. Rather, the\nSupreme Lord, by His great mercy, comes at once, riding on His bird carrier\nGaru\u1e0da, and at once delivers the devotee from this material existence. Although\na man who has fallen in the ocean may struggle very hard and may be very expert\nin swimming, he cannot save himself. But if someone comes and picks him up from\nthe water, then he is easily rescued. Similarly, the Lord picks up the devotee\nfrom this material existence. One simply has to practice the easy process of\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and fully engage himself in devotional service. Any\nintelligent man should always prefer the process of devotional service to all\nother paths. In the N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47\u012bya this is confirmed as follows:  y\u0101 vai s\u0101dhana-sampatti-puru\u1e63\u0101rtha-catu\u1e63\u1e6daye tay\u0101 vin\u0101 tad-\u0101pnoti naro\nn\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47\u0101\u015braya\u1e25  The purport of this verse is that one should not engage in the different\nprocesses of fruitive activity or cultivate knowledge by the mental speculative\nprocess. One who is devoted to the Supreme Personality can attain all the\nbenefits derived from other yogic processes, speculation, rituals, sacrifices,\ncharities, etc. That is the specific benediction of devotional service.  Simply by chanting the holy name of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2014Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a,\nHare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare\u2014a devotee of the Lord can\napproach the supreme destination easily and happily, but this destination cannot\nbe approached by any other process of religion.  The conclusion of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is stated in the Eighteenth Chapter:  sarva-dharm\u0101n parityajya m\u0101m eka\u1e41 \u015bara\u1e47a\u1e41 vraja aha\u1e41 tv\u0101\u1e41 sarva-p\u0101pebhyo\nmok\u1e63ayi\u1e63y\u0101mi m\u0101 \u015buca\u1e25.  One should give up all other processes of self-realization and simply execute\ndevotional service in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. That will enable one to reach the\nhighest perfection of life. There is no need for one to consider the sinful\nactions of his past life because the Supreme Lord fully takes charge of him.\nTherefore one should not futilely try to deliver himself in spiritual\nrealization. Let everyone take shelter of the supreme omnipotent Godhead K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\nThat is the highest perfection of life.",

When he offers K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a food,\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a directly accepts these eatables, and the devotee becomes K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-ized by\neating the remnants.

TRANSLATION  My dear Arjuna, O winner of wealth, if you cannot fix your mind upon Me without\ndeviation, then follow the regulated principles of bhakti-yoga In this way you\nwill develop a desire to attain to Me.  PURPORT  In this verse, two different processes of bhakti-yoga are indicated. The first\napplies to one who has actually developed an attachment for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead, by transcendental love. And the other is for one who has\nnot developed an attachment for the Supreme Person by transcendental love. For\nthis second class there are different prescribed rules and regulations, which\none can follow to be ultimately elevated to the stage of attachment to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.  Bhakti-yoga is the purification of the senses. At the present moment in material\nexistence the senses are always impure, being engaged in sense gratification.\nBut, by the practice of bhakti-yoga these senses can become purified, and in the\npurified state they come directly in contact with the Supreme Lord. In this\nmaterial existence, I may be engaged in some service to some master, but I don\u2019t\nreally lovingly serve my master. I simply serve to get some money. And the\nmaster also is not in love; he takes service from me and pays me. So there is no\nquestion of love. But for spiritual life, one must be elevated to the pure stage\nof love. That stage of love can be achieved by practice of devotional service,\nperformed with the present senses.  This love of God is now in a dormant state in everyone\u2019s heart. And, there, love\nof God is manifested in different ways, but it is contaminated by the material\nassociation. Now the material association has to be purified, and that dormant,\nnatural love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has to be revived. That is the whole process.  To practice the regulative principles of bhakti-yoga one should, under the\nguidance of an expert spiritual master, follow certain principles: one should\nrise early in the morning, take bath, enter the temple and offer prayers and\nchant Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, then collect flowers to offer to the Deity, cook foodstuffs to\noffer to the Deity, take pras\u0101dam, and so on. There are various rules and\nregulations which one should follow. And one should constantly hear\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam from pure devotees. This practice can help\nanyone to rise to the level of love of God, and then he is sure of his progress\ninto the spiritual kingdom of God. This practice of bhakti-yoga, under the rules\nand regulations, with the direction of a spiritual master, will surely bring one\nto the stage of love of God.",

PURPORT  One who is not able even to practice the regulative principles of bhakti-yoga,\nunder the guidance of a spiritual master, can still be drawn to this\nperfectional stage by working for the Supreme Lord. How to do this work has\nalready been explained in the fifty-fifth verse of the Eleventh Chapter. One\nshould be sympathetic to the propagation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. There are many\ndevotees who are engaged in the propagation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, and they\nrequire help. So, even if one cannot directly practice the regulated principles\nof bhakti-yoga, he can try to help such work. Every endeavor requires land,\ncapital, organization, and labor. Just as, in business, one requires a place to\nstay, some capital to use, some labor, and some organization to expand, so the\nsame is required in the service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The only difference is that in\nmaterialism one works for sense gratification. The same work, however, can be\nperformed for the satisfaction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and that is spiritual activity. If one\nhas sufficient money, he can help in building an office or temple for\npropagating K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Or he can help with publications. There are\nvarious fields of activity, and one should be interested in such activities. If\none cannot sacrifice the result of such activities, the same person can still\nsacrifice some percentage to propagate K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. This voluntary\nservice to the cause of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness will help one to rise to a higher\nstate of love for God, whereupon one becomes perfect.",

TRANSLATION  If, however, you are unable to work in this consciousness, then try to act\ngiving up all results of your work and try to be self-situated.  PURPORT  It may be that one is unable to even sympathize with the activities of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness because of social, familial or religious considerations or because\nof some other impediments. If one attaches himself directly to the activities of\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, there may be objection from family members, or so many\nother difficulties. For one who has such a problem, it is advised that he\nsacrifice the accumulated result of his activities to some good cause. Such\nprocedures are described in the Vedic rules. There are many descriptions of\nsacrifices and special functions of the pumundi or special work in which the\nresult of one\u2019s previous action may be applied. Thus one may gradually become\nelevated to the state of knowledge. It is also found that when one who is not\neven interested in the activities of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness gives charity to some\nhospital or some other social institution, he gives up the hard-earned results\nof his activities. That is also recommended here because by the practice of\ngiving up the fruits of one\u2019s activities one is sure to purify his mind\ngradually, and in that purified stage of mind one becomes able to understand\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Of course K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is not dependant on any other\nexperience because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness itself can purify one\u2019s mind, but if\nthere are impediments to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, one may try to give up the result\nof his action. In that respect, social service, community service, national\nservice, sacrifice for one\u2019s country, etc., may be accepted so that some day one\nmay come to the stage of pure devotional service to the Supreme Lord. In\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 we find it is stated: yata\u1e25 prav\u1e5bttir bh\u016bt\u0101n\u0101m: If one decides to\nsacrifice for the supreme cause, even if he does not know that the supreme cause\nis K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he will come gradually to understand that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the supreme cause\nby the sacrificial method.",

TRANSLATION  If you cannot take to this practice, then engage yourself in the cultivation of\nknowledge. Better than knowledge, however, is meditation, and better than\nmeditation is renunciation of the fruits of action, for by such renunciation one\ncan attain peace of mind.  PURPORT  As mentioned in the previous verses, there are two kinds of devotional service:\nthe way of regulated principles, and the way of full attachment in love to the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead. For those who are actually not able to follow\nthe principles of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, it is better to cultivate knowledge\nbecause by knowledge one can be able to understand his real position. Gradually\nknowledge will develop to the point of meditation. By meditation one can be able\nto understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead by a gradual process. There are\nprocesses which make one understand that one himself is the Supreme, and that\nsort of meditation is preferred if one is unable to engage in devotional\nservice. If one is not able to meditate in such a way, then there are prescribed\nduties, as enjoined in the Vedic literature, for the br\u0101hma\u1e47as, vai\u015byas, and\n\u015b\u016bdras, which we shall find in a later chapter of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. But in all\ncases, one should give up the result or fruits of labor; this means to employ\nthe result of karma for some good cause. In summary, to reach the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead, the highest goal, there are two processes: one process\nis by gradual development, and the other process is direct. Devotional service\nin K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is the direct method, and the other method involves\nrenouncing the fruits of one\u2019s activities. Then one can come to the stage of\nknowledge, then to the stage of meditation, then to the stage of understanding\nthe Supersoul, and then to the stage of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One\nmay either take the step by step process or the direct path. The direct process\nis not possible for everyone; therefore the indirect process is also good. It\nis, however, to be understood that the indirect process is not recommended for\nArjuna because he is already at the stage of loving devotional service to the\nSupreme Lord. It is for others who are not at this state; for them the gradual\nprocess of renunciation, knowledge, meditation and realization of the Supersoul\nand Brahman should be followed. But as far as Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is concerned, it is\nthe direct method that is stressed. Everyone is advised to take to the direct\nmethod and surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",

TRANSLATION  One who is not envious but who is a kind friend to all living entities, who does\nnot think himself a proprietor, who is free from false ego and equal both in\nhappiness and distress, who is always satisfied and engaged in devotional\nservice with determination and whose mind and intelligence are in agreement with\nMe\u2014he is very dear to Me.  PURPORT  Coming again to the point of pure devotional service, the Lord is describing the\ntranscendental qualifications of a pure devotee in these two verses. A pure\ndevotee is never disturbed in any circumstances. Nor is he envious of anyone.\nNor does a devotee become his enemy\u2019s enemy; he thinks that one is acting as his\nenemy due to his own past misdeeds. Thus it is better to suffer than to protest.\nIn the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam it is stated: tat te \u2019nukamp\u0101\u1e41 su-sam\u012bk\u1e63yama\u1e47o.\nWhenever a devotee is in distress or has fallen into difficulty, he thinks that\nit is the Lord\u2019s mercy upon him. He thinks: \u201cThanks to my past misdeeds I should\nsuffer far, far greater than I am suffering now. So it is by the mercy of the\nSupreme Lord that I am not getting all the punishment I am due. I am just\ngetting a little, by the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\u201d Therefore\nhe is always calm, quiet and patient, despite many distressful conditions. A\ndevotee is also always kind to everyone, even to his enemy. Nirmama means that a\ndevotee does not attach much importance to the peace and trouble pertaining to\nthe body because he knows perfectly well that he is not the material body. He\ndoes not identify with the body; therefore he is freed from the conception of\nfalse ego and is equiposed both in happiness and distress. He is tolerant, and\nhe is satisfied with whatever comes by the grace of the Supreme Lord. He does\nnot endeavor much to achieve something with great difficulty; therefore he is\nalways joyful. He is a completely perfect mystic because he is fixed in the\ninstructions received from the spiritual master, and because his senses are\ncontrolled, he is determined. He is not swayed by false argument because no one\ncan lead him from the fixed determination of devotional service. He is fully\nconscious that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the eternal Lord, so no one can disturb him. All his\nqualifications enable him to depend entirely on the Supreme Lord. Such a\nstandard of devotional service is undoubtably very rare, but a devotee becomes\nsituated in that stage by following the regulative principles of devotional\nservice. Furthermore, the Lord says that such a devotee is very dear to Him, for\nthe Lord is always pleased with all his activities in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.",

TRANSLATION  He for whom no one is put into difficulty and who is not dirturbed by anxiety,\nwho is steady in happiness and distress, is very dear to Me.  PURPORT  A few of a devotee\u2019s qualifications are further being described. No one is put\ninto difficulty, anxiety, fearfulness, or dissatisfaction by such a devotee.\nSince a devotee is kind to everyone, he does not act in such a way to put others\ninto anxiety. At the same time, if others try to put a devotee into anxiety, he\nis not disturbed. It is by the grace of the Lord that he is so practiced that he\nis not disturbed by any outward disturbance. Actually because a devotee is\nalways engrossed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and engaged in devotional service, all\nsuch material circumstances cannot woo him. Generally a materialistic person\nbecomes very happy when there is something for his sense gratification and his\nbody, but when he sees that others have something for their sense gratification\nand he hasn\u2019t, he is sorry and envious. When he is expecting some retaliation\nfrom an enemy, he is in a state of fear, and when he cannot successfully execute\nsomething he becomes dejected. But a devotee is always transcendental to all\nthese disturbances; therefore he is very dear to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",

PURPORT  Money may be offered to a devotee, but he should not struggle to acquire it. If\nautomatically, by the grace of the Supreme, money comes to him, he is not\nag\u012bt\u0101ted. Naturally a devotee takes bath at least twice in a day and rises early\nin the morning for devotional service. Thus he is naturally clean both inwardly\nand outwardly. A devotee is always expert because he fully knows the sense of\nall activities of life, and he is convinced of the authoritative scriptures. A\ndevotee never takes the part of a particular party; therefore he is carefree. He\nis never pained because he is free from all designations; he knows that his body\nis a designation, so if there are some bodily pains, he is free. The pure\ndevotee does not endeavor for anything which is against the principles of\ndevotional service. For example, constructing a big building requires great\nenergy, and a devotee does not take to such business if it does not benefit him\nby advancing his devotional service. He may construct a temple for the Lord, and\nfor that he may take all kinds of anxiety, but he does not construct a big house\nfor his personal relations.",

PURPORT  A devotee is always free from all bad association. Sometimes one is praised and\nsometimes one is defamed; that is the nature of human society. But a devotee is\nalways transcendental to artificial fame and infamy, distress or happiness. He\nis very patient. He does not speak of anything but the topics about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a;\ntherefore he is called silent. Silent does not mean that one should not speak;\nsilent means that one should not speak nonsense. One should speak only of\nessentials, and the most essential speech for the devotee is to speak of the\nSupreme Lord. He is happy in all conditions; sometimes he may get very palatable\nfoodstuffs, sometimes not, but he is satisfied. Nor does he care for any\nresidential facility. He may sometimes live underneath a tree, and he may\nsometimes live in a very palatial building; he is attracted to neither. He is\ncalled fixed because he is fixed in his determination and knowledge. We may find\nsome repetition in the descriptions of the qualifications of a devotee, but this\nis just to give an illustration of the fact that a devotee must acquire all\nthese qualifications. Without good qualifications, one cannot be a pure devotee.\nOne who is not a devotee has no good qualification. One who wants to be\nrecognized as a devotee should develop the good qualifications.

PURPORT  In this chapter the religion of eternal engagement, the explanation of the\nprocess of transcendental service for approaching the Supreme Lord, is given.\nThis process is very dear to the Lord, and He accepts a person who is engaged in\nsuch a process. The question who is better\u2014one who is engaged in the path of\nimpersonal Brahman or one who is engaged in the personal service of the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead\u2014was raised by Arjuna, and the Lord replied to him so\nexplicitly that there is no doubt that devotional service to the Personality of\nGodhead is the best of all processes of spiritual realization. In other words,\nin this chapter it is decided that through good association, one develops\nattachment for pure devotional service and thereby accepts a bona fide spiritual\nmaster and from him begins to hear and chant and observe the regulative\nprinciples of devotional service with faith, attachment and devotion and thus\nbecomes engaged in the transcendental service of the Lord. This path is\nrecommended in this chapter; therefore there is no doubt that devotional service\nis the only absolute path for self-realization, for the attainment of the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead. The impersonal conception of the Supreme\nAbsolute Truth, as described in this chapter, is recommended only up to the time\none surrenders himself for self-realization. In other words, as long as one does\nnot have the chance to associate with a pure devotee, the impersonal conception\nmay be beneficial. In the impersonal conception of the Absolute Truth one works\nwithout fruitive result, meditates and cultivates knowledge to understand spirit\nand matter. This is necessary as long as one is not in the association of a pure\ndevotee. Fortunately, if one develops directly a desire to engage in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness in pure devotional service, he does not need to undergo step by\nstep improvements in spiritual realization. Devotional service, as described in\nthe middle six chapters of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, is more congenial. One need not bother\nabout materials to keep body and soul together because by the grace of the Lord\neverything is carried out automatically.",

The Blessed Lord then said: This body, O son of Kunt\u012b, is\ncalled the field, and one who knows this body is called the knower of the field.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nArjuna was inquisitive about prak\u1e5bti or nature, puru\u1e63a, the enjoyer, k\u1e63etra, the\nfield, k\u1e63etraj\u00f1a, its knower, and of knowledge and the object of knowledge. When\nhe inquired about all these, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a said that this body is called the field and\nthat one who knows this body is called the knower of the field. This body is the\nfield of activity for the conditioned soul. The conditioned soul is entrapped in\nmaterial existence, and he attempts to lord over material nature. And so,\naccording to his capacity to dominate material nature, he gets a field of\nactivity. That field of activity is the body. And what is the body? The body is\nmade of senses. The conditioned soul wants to enjoy sense gratification, and,\naccording to his capacity to enjoy sense gratification, he is offered a body, or\nfield of activity. Therefore the body is called k\u1e63etra, or the field of activity\nfor the conditioned soul. Now, the person who does not identify himself with the\nbody is called k\u1e63etraj\u00f1a, the knower of the field. It is not very difficult to\nunderstand the difference between the field and its knower, the body and the\nknower of the body. Any person can consider that from childhood to old age he\nundergoes so many changes of body and yet is still one person, remaining. Thus\nthere is a difference between the knower of the field of activities and the\nactual field of activities. A living conditioned soul can thus understand that\nhe is different from the body. It is described in the beginning\u2014dehe \u2019smin\u2014that\nthe living entity is within the body and that the body is changing from\nchildhood to boyhood and from boyhood to youth and from youth to old age, and\nthe person who owns the body knows that the body is changing. The owner is\ndistinctly k\u1e63etraj\u00f1a. Sometimes we understand that I am happy, I am mad, I am a\nwoman, I am a dog, I am a cat: these are the knowers. The knower is different\nfrom the field. Although we use many articles\u2014our clothes, etc.\u2014we know- that we\nare different from the things used. Similarly, we also understand by a little\ncontemplation that we are different from the body.\n\n\nIn the first six chapters of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, the knower of the body, the living\nentity, and the position by which he can understand the Supreme Lord are\ndescribed. In the middle six chapters of the G\u012bt\u0101, the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead and the relationship between the individual soul and the Supersoul in\nregard to devotional service are described. The superior position of the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead and the subordinate position of the individual soul are\ndefinitely defined in these chapters. The living entities are subordinate under\nall circumstances, but in their forgetfulness they are suffering. When\nenlightened by pious activities, they approach the Supreme Lord in different\ncapacities\u2014as the distressed, those in want of money, the inquisitive, and those\nin search of knowledge. That is also described. Now, starting with the\nThirteenth Chapter, how the living entity comes into contact with material\nnature, how he is delivered by the Supreme Lord through the different methods of\nfruitive activities, cultivation of knowledge, and the discharge of devotional\nservice are explained. Although the living entity is completely different from\nthe material body, he somehow becomes related. This also is explained.\n\n\n13.3\n\n\nk\u1e63etra-j\u00f1a\u1e41 c\u0101pi m\u0101\u1e41 viddhi\n\n\nsarva-k\u1e63etre\u1e63u bh\u0101rata\n\n\nk\u1e63etra-k\u1e63etraj\u00f1ayor j\u00f1\u0101na\u1e41\n\n\nyat taj j\u00f1\u0101na\u1e41 mata\u1e41 mama\n\n\nk\u1e63etraj\u00f1am\u2014the knower; ca\u2014also; api\u2014certainly; m\u0101m\u2014Me; viddhi\u2014know; sarva\u2014all;\nk\u1e63etre\u1e63u\u2014in bodily fields; bh\u0101rata\u2014O son of Bharata; k\u1e63etra\u2014field of activities\n(the body); k\u1e63etraj\u00f1ayo\u1e25\u2014the knower of the field; j\u00f1\u0101nam\u2014knowledge; yat\u2014that\nwhich is taught; tat\u2014that; j\u00f1\u0101nam\u2014knowledge; matam\u2014opinion; mama\u2014that.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nO scion of Bharata, you should understand that I am also the knower in all\nbodies, and to understand this body and its owner is called knowledge. That is\nMy opinion.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nWhile discussing the subject of this body and the owner of the body, the soul\nand the Supersoul, we shall find three different topics of study: the Lord, the\n1iving entity, and matter. In every field of activities, in every body, there\nare two souls: the individual soul and the Supersoul. Because the Supersoul is\nthe plenary expansion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says,\n\u201cI am also the knower, but I am not the individual owner of the body. I am the\nsuperknower. I am present in every body as the Param\u0101tm\u0101, or Supersoul.\u201d\n\n\nOne who studies the subject matter of the field of activity and the knower of\nthe field very minutely, in terms of this Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, can attain to\nknowledge.\n\n\nThe Lord says: \u201cI am the knower of the field of activities in every individual\nbody.\u201d The individual may be the knower of his own body, but he is not in\nknowledge of other bodies. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is present as\nthe Supersoul in all bodies, knows everything about all bodies. He knows all the\ndifferent bodies of all the various species of life. A citizen may know\neverything about his patch of land, but the king knows not only his palace but\nall the properties possessed by the individual citizens. Similarly, one may be\nthe proprietor of the body individually, but the Supreme Lord is the proprietor\nof all bodies. The king is the original proprietor of the kingdom, and the\ncitizen is the secondary proprietor. Similarly, the Supreme Lord is the supreme\nproprietor of all bodies.\n\n\nThe body consists of the senses. The Supreme Lord is H\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba, which means\ncontroller of the senses. He is the original controller of the senses, just as\nthe king is the original controller of all the activities of the state, and the\ncitizens are secondary controllers. The Lord also says: \u201cI am also the knower.\u201d\nThis means that He is the superknower; the individual soul knows only his\nparticular body. In the Vedic literature, it is stated as follows:\n\n\nk\u1e63etr\u0101\u1e47i hi \u015bar\u012br\u0101\u1e47i b\u012bja\u1e41 c\u0101pi \u015bubh\u0101\u015bubhe t\u0101ni vetti sa yog\u0101tm\u0101 tata\u1e25 k\u1e63etraj\u00f1a\nucyate.\n\n\nThis body is called the k\u1e63etra, and within it dwells the owner of the body and\nthe Supreme Lord who knows both the body and the owner of the body. Therefore He\nis called the knower of all fields. The distinction between the field of\nactivities, the owner of activities and the supreme owner of activities is\ndescribed as follows. Perfect knowledge of the constitution of the body, the\nconstitution of the individual soul, and the constitution of the Supersoul is\nknown in terms of Vedic literature as j\u00f1\u0101nam. That is the opinion of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. To\nunderstand both the soul and the Supersoul as one yet distinct is knowledge. One\nwho does not understand the field of activity and the knower of activity is not\nin perfect knowledge. One has to understand the position of prak\u1e5bti, nature, and\npuru\u1e63a, the enjoyer of the nature, and \u012b\u015bvara, the knower who dominates or\ncontrols nature and the individual soul. One should not confuse the three in\ntheir different capacities. One should not confuse the painter, the painting and\nthe easel. This material world, which is the field of activities, is nature, and\nthe enjoyer of nature is the living entity, and above them both is the supreme\ncontroller, the Personality of Godhead. It is stated in the Vedic language:\n\u201cbhokt\u0101 bhogya\u1e41 prerit\u0101ra\u1e41 ca matv\u0101 sarva\u1e41 prokta\u1e41 tri-vidha\u1e41 brahmam etat.\u201d\nThere are three Brahman conceptions: prak\u1e5bti is Brahman as the field of\nactivities, and the j\u012bva (individual soul) is also Brahman and is trying to\ncontrol material nature, and the controller of both of them is also Brahman, but\nHe is the factual controller.\n\n\nIn this chapter it will be also explained that out of the two knowers, one is\nfallible and the other is infallible. One is superior and the other is\nsubordinate. One who understands the two knowers of the field to be one and the\nsame contradicts the Supreme Personality of Godhead who states here very clearly\nthat \u201cI am also the knower of the field of activity.\u201d One who misunderstands a\nrope to be a serpent is not in knowledge. There are different kinds of bodies,\nand there are different owners of the bodies. Because each individual soul has\nhis individual capacity of lording it over material nature, there are different\nbodies. But the Supreme also is present in them as the controller. The word ca\nis significant, for it indicates the total number of bodies. That is the opinion\nof \u015ar\u012bla Baladeva Vidy\u0101bh\u016b\u1e63a\u1e47a: K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supersoul present in each and every\nbody apart from the individual soul. And K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a explicitly says here that the\nSupersoul is the controller of both the field of activities and the finite\nenjoyer.\n\n\n13.4\n\n\ntat k\u1e63etra\u1e41 yac ca y\u0101d\u1e5bk ca\n\n\nyad-vik\u0101ri yata\u015b ca yat\n\n\nsa ca yo yat-prabh\u0101va\u015b ca\n\n\ntat sam\u0101sena me \u015b\u1e5b\u1e47u\n\n\ntat\u2014that; k\u1e63etram\u2014field of activities; yat\u2014as; ca\u2014also; y\u0101d\u1e5bk\u2014as it is; ca\u2014also;\nyat\u2014what is; vik\u0101ri\u2014changes; yata\u1e25\u2014from which; ca\u2014also; yat\u2014one; sa\u1e25\u2014he;\nca\u2014also; ya\u1e25\u2014one; yat\u2014which; prabh\u0101va\u1e25 ca\u2014influence also; tat\u2014that; sam\u0101sena\u2014in\ndetail; me\u2014from Me; \u015b\u1e5b\u1e47u\u2014understand.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nNow please hear My brief description of this field of activity and how it is\nconstituted, what its changes are, whence it is produced, who that knower of the\nfield of activities is, and what his influences are.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe Lord is describing the field of activities and the knower of the field of\nactivities in their constitutional positions. One has to know how this body is\nconstituted, the materials of which this body is made, under whose control this\nbody is working, how the changes are taking place, wherefrom the changes are\ncoming, what the causes are, what the reasons are, what the ultimate goal of the\nindividual is, and what the actual form of the individual soul is. One should\nalso know the distinction between the individual living soul and the Supersoul,\nthe different influences, their potentials, etc. One just has to understand this\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 directly from the description given by the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead, and all this will be clarified. But one should be careful not to\nconsider the Supreme Personality of Godhead in every body and individual soul to\nbe the j\u012bva. This is something like equalizing the potent and the impotent.\n\n\n13.5\n\n\n\u1e5b\u1e63ibhir bahudh\u0101 g\u012bta\u1e41\n\n\nchandobhir vividhai\u1e25 p\u1e5bthak\n\n\nbrahma-s\u016btra-padai\u015b caiva\n\n\nhetumadbhir vini\u015bcitai\u1e25\n\n\n\u1e5b\u1e63ibhi\u1e25\u2014by the wise sages; bahudh\u0101\u2014in many ways; g\u012bt\u0101m\u2014described;\nchandobhi\u1e25\u2014Vedic hymns; vividhai\u1e25\u2014in various; p\u1e5bthak\u2014variously; brahma-s\u016btra\u2014the\nVed\u0101nta; padai\u1e25\u2014aphorism; ca\u2014also; eva\u2014certainly; hetumadbhi\u1e25\u2014with cause and\neffect; vini\u015bcitai\u1e25\u2014ascertain.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThat knowledge of the field of activities and of the knower of activities is\ndescribed by various sages in various Vedic writings\u2014especially in the\nVed\u0101nta-s\u016btra\u2014and is presented with all reasoning as to cause and effect.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is the highest authority in\nexplaining this knowledge. Still, as a matter of course, learned scholars and\nstandard authorities always give evidence from previous authorities. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is\nexplaining this most controversial point regarding the duality and non-duality\nof the soul and the Supersoul by referring to Scriptures, the Ved\u0101nta, which are\naccepted as authority. First, He says, this is according to different sages. As\nfar as the sages are concerned, besides Himself, Vy\u0101sadeva, the author of the\nVed\u0101nta-s\u016btra, is a great sage, and in the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra duality is perfectly\nexplained. And Vy\u0101sadeva\u2019s father, Par\u0101\u015bara, was also a great sage, and he\nwrites in his books of religiosity: \u201caham tva\u1e41 ca ath\u0101nye\u2026\u201d \u201cWe\u2014you, I and\nvarious other living entities\u2014are all transcendental, although in material\nbodies. Now we are fallen into the ways of the three modes of material nature\naccording to our different karma. As such, some are on higher levels, and some\nare in the lower nature. The higher and lower natures exist due to ignorance and\nare being manifested in an infinite number of living entities. But the\nSupersoul, which is infallible, is uncontaminated by the three qualities of\nnature and is transcendental.\u201d Similarly, in the original Vedas, a distinction\nbetween the soul, the Supersoul and the body is made, especially in the Ka\u1e6dha\nUpani\u1e63ad.\n\n\nThere is a manifestation of the Supreme Lord\u2019s energy known as annamaya by which\none depends simply upon food for existence. This is a materialistic realization\nof the Supreme. Then there is pr\u0101\u1e47amaya; this means that after realizing the\nSupreme Absolute Truth in foodstuff, one can realize the Absolute Truth in the\nliving symptoms, or life forms. In j\u00f1\u0101namaya the living symptom develops to the\npoint of thinking, feeling, and willing. Then there is Brahman realization and\nthe realization called vij\u00f1\u0101namaya by which the living entity\u2019s mind and life\nsymptoms are distinguished from the living entity himself. The next and supreme\nstage is \u0101nandamaya, realization of the all-blissful nature. Thus there are five\nstages of Brahman realization, which is called brahma puccham. Out of these the\nfirst three\u2014annamaya, pr\u0101\u1e47amaya, and j\u00f1\u0101namaya\u2014involve the fields of activities\nof the living entities. Transcendental to all these fields of activities is the\nSupreme Lord, who is called \u0101nandamaya. In the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra also the Supreme is\ncalled \u0101nandamayo \u2019bhy\u0101s\u0101t. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is by nature full\nof joy, and to enjoy His transcendental bliss, He expands into vij\u00f1\u0101namaya,\npr\u0101\u1e47amaya, j\u00f1\u0101namaya, and annamaya. In this field of activities the living\nentity is considered to be the enjoyer, and different from him is the\n\u0101nandamaya. That means that if the living entity decides to enjoy, in\ndovetailing himself with the \u0101nandamaya, then he becomes perfect. This is the\nreal picture of the Supreme Lord, as supreme knower of the field, the living\nentity, as subordinate knower, and the nature of the field of activities.\n\n\n13.6-7\n\n\nmah\u0101-bh\u016bt\u0101ny aha\u1e45k\u0101ro\n\n\nbuddhir avyaktam eva ca\n\n\nindriy\u0101\u1e47i da\u015baika\u1e41 ca\n\n\npa\u00f1ca cendriya-gocar\u0101\u1e25\n\n\nicch\u0101 dve\u1e63a\u1e25 sukha\u1e41 du\u1e25kha\u1e41\n\n\nsa\u1e45gh\u0101ta\u015b cetan\u0101 dh\u1e5bti\u1e25\n\n\netat k\u1e63etra\u1e41 sam\u0101sena\n\n\nsa-vik\u0101ram ud\u0101h\u1e5btam\n\n\nmah\u0101-bh\u016bt\u0101ni\u2014great elements; aha\u1e45k\u0101ra\u1e25\u2014false ego; buddhi\u1e25\u2014intelligence;\navyaktam\u2014the unmanifested; eva\u2014certainly; ca\u2014also; indriy\u0101\u1e47i\u2014senses ; da\u015ba\nekam\u2014eleven; ca\u2014also; pa\u00f1ca\u2014five; ca\u2014also; indriya-gocar\u0101\u1e25\u2014objects of the\nsenses; icch\u0101\u2014desire; dve\u1e63a\u1e25\u2014hatred; sukham\u2014happiness; du\u1e25kham\u2014distress;\nsa\u1e45ghata\u1e25\u2014the aggregate; cetan\u0101\u2014living symptoms; dh\u1e5bti\u1e25\u2014conviction; etat\u2014all\nthis; k\u1e63etram\u2014field of activities; sam\u0101sena\u2014in summary; sa-vik\u0101ram\u2014interaction;\nud\u0101h\u1e5btam\u2014exemplified.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThe five great elements, false ego, intelligence, the unmanifested, the ten\nsenses, the mind, the five sense objects, desire, hatred, happiness, distress,\nthe aggregate, the life symptoms, and convictions\u2014all these are considered, in\nsummary, to be the field of activities and its interactions.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nFrom all the authoritative statements of the great sages, the Vedic hymns and\nthe aphorisms of the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra, the components of this world are earth,\nwater, fire, air and ether. These are the five great elements (mah\u0101bh\u016bta). Then\nthere are false ego, intelligence and the unmanifested stage of the three modes\nof nature. Then there are five senses for acquiring knowledge: the eyes, ears,\nnose, tongue and touch. Then five working senses: voice, legs, hands, the anus\nand the genitals. Then, above the senses, there is the mind, which is within and\nwhich can be called the sense within. Therefore, including the mind, there are\neleven senses altogether. Then there are the five objects of the senses: smell,\ntaste, warmth, touch and sound. Now the aggregate of these twenty-four elements\nis called the field of activity. If one makes an analytical study of these\ntwenty-four subjects, then he can very well understand the field of activity.\nThen there is desire, hatred, pleasure and pain, which are interactions,\nrepresentations of the five great elements in the gross body. The living\nsymptoms, represented by consciousness and conviction, are the manifestation of\nthe subtle body\u2014mind, ego and intelligence. These subtle elements are included\nwithin the field of activities.\n\n\nThe five great elements are a gross representation of the subtle false ego. They\nare a representation in the material conception. Consciousness is represented by\nintelligence, of which the unmanifested stage is the three modes of material\nnature. The unmanifested three modes of material nature is called pradh\u0101na.\n\n\nOne who desires to know the twenty-four elements in detail along with their\ninteractions should study the philosophy in more detail.

But actually this is the real\nprocess of knowledge. If one accepts this process, then the possibility of\napproaching the Absolute Truth exists. This is not the interaction of the\ntenfold elements, as described before, This is actually the means to get out of\nit. Of all the descriptions of the process of knowledge, the most important\npoint is described in the first line of the tenth verse: The process of\nknowledge terminates in unalloyed devotional service to the Lord. So, if one\ndoes not approach, or is not able to approach, the transcendental service of the\nLord, then the other nineteen items are of no particular value. But, if one\ntakes to devotional service in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, the other nineteen\nitems automatically develop within him. The principle of accepting a spiritual\nmaster, as mentioned in the seventh verse, is essential. Even for one who takes\nto devotional service, it is most important. Transcendental life begins when one\naccepts a bona fide spiritual master. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, \u015ar\u012b\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, clearly states here that this process of knowledge is the actual path.\nAnything speculated beyond this is nonsense.\n\n\nAs for the knowledge outlined here, the items may be analyzed as follows:\nHumility means that one should not be anxious to have the satisfaction of being\nhonored by others. The material conception of life makes us very eager to\nreceive honor from others, but from the point of view of a man in perfect\nknowledge\u2014who knows that he is not this body\u2014anything, honor or dishonor,\npertaining to this body is useless. One should not be hankering after this\nmaterial deception. People are very anxious to be famous for their religion, and\nconsequently sometimes it is found that without understanding the principles of\nreligion, one enters into some group, which is not actually following religious\nprinciples, and then wants to advertise himself as a religious mentor. As for\nactual advancement in spiritual science, one should have a test to see how far\nhe is progressing. He can judge by these items.\n\n\nNonviolence is generally taken to mean not killing or destroying the body, but\nactually nonviolence means not to put others into distress. People in general\nare trapped by ignorance in the material concept of life, and they perpetually\nsuffer material pains. So, unless one elevates people to spiritual knowledge,\none is practicing violence. One should try his best to distribute real knowledge\nto the people, so that they may become enlightened and leave this material\nentanglement. That is nonviolence.\n\n\nTolerance means that one should be practiced to bear insult and dishonor from\nothers. If one is engaged in the advancement of spiritual knowledge, there will\nbe so many insults and much dishonor from others. This is expected because\nmaterial nature is so constituted. Even a boy like Prahl\u0101da, who, only five\nyears old, was engaged in the cultivation of spiritual knowledge, was endangered\nwhen his father became antagonistic to his devotion. The father tried to kill\nhim in so many ways, but Prahlada tolerated him. So, for making advancement in\nspiritual knowledge, there may be many impediments, but we should be tolerant\nand continue our progress with determination.\n\n\nSimplicity means that without diplomacy one should be so straightforward that he\ncan disclose the real truth even to an enemy. As for acceptance of the spiritual\nmaster, that is essential, because without the instruction of a bona fide\nspiritual master, one cannot progress in the spiritual science. One should\napproach the spiritual master with all humility and offer him all services so\nthat he will be pleased to bestow his blessings upon the disciple. Because a\nbona fide spiritual master is a representative of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, if he bestows any\nblessings upon his disciple, that will make the disciple immediately advanced\nwithout the disciple\u2019s following the regulated principles. Or, the regulated\nprinciples will be easier for one who has served the spiritual master without\nreservation.\n\n\nCleanliness is essential for making advancement in spiritual life. There are two\nkinds of cleanliness: external and internal. External cleanliness means taking a\nbath, but for internal cleanliness, one has to think of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a always and chant\nHare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/Hare R\u0101ma. Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma\nHare Hare. This process cleans the accumulated dust of past karma from the mind.\n\n\nSteadiness means that one should be very determined to make progress in\nspiritual life. Without such determination, one cannot make tangible progress.\nAnd self-control means that one should not accept anything which is detrimental\nto the path of spiritual progress. One should become accustomed to this and\nreject anything which is against the path of spiritual progress. This is real\nrenunciation. The senses are so strong that they are always anxious to have\nsense gratification. One should not cater to these demands, which are not\nnecessary. The senses should only be gratified to keep the body fit so that one\ncan discharge his duty in advancing in spiritual life. The most important and\nuncontrollable sense is the tongue. If one can control the tongue, then there is\nevery possibility of controlling the other senses. The function of the tongue is\nto taste and to vibrate. Therefore, by systematic regulation, the tongue should\nalways be engaged in tasting the remnants of foodstuffs offered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and\nchanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. As far as the eyes are concerned, they should not be\nallowed to see anything but the beautiful form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. That will control the\neyes. Similarly, the ears should be engaged in hearing about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and the nose\nin smelling the flowers offered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This is the process of devotional\nservice, and it is understood here that Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is simply expounding the\nscience of devotional service. Devotional service is the main and sole\nobjective. Unintelligent commentators on the G\u012bt\u0101 try to divert the mind of the\nreader to other subjects, but there is no other subject in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 but\ndevotional service.\n\n\nFalse ego means accepting this body as oneself. When one understands that he is\nnot his body and is spirit soul, that is real ego. Ego is there. False ego is\ncondemned, but not real ego. In the Vedic literature, it is said: aha\u1e41\nbrahm\u0101smi. I am Brahman, I am spirit. This \u201cI am,\u201d the sense of self, also\nexists in the liberated stage of self-realization. This sense of \u201cI am\u201d is ego,\nbut when the sense of \u201cI am\u201d is applied to this false body, it is false ego.\nWhen the sense of self is applied to reality, that is real ego. There are some\nphilosophers who say we should give up our ego, but we cannot give up our ego\nbecause ego means identity. We ought, of course, to give up the false\nidentification with the body.\n\n\nOne should try to understand the distress of accepting birth, death, old age and\ndisease. There are descriptions in various Vedic literatures of birth. In the\n\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam the world of the unborn, the child\u2019s stay in the womb of the\nmother, its suffering, etc., are all very graphically described. It should be\nthoroughly understood that birth is distressful. Because we forget how much\ndistress we have suffered within the womb of the mother, we do not make any\nsolution to the repetition of birth and death. Similarly at the time of death,\nthere are all kinds of sufferings, and they are also mentioned in the\nauthoritative scriptures. These should be discussed. And as far as disease and\nold age are concerned, everyone gets practical experience. No one wants to be\ndiseased, and no one wants to become old, but there is no avoiding these. Unless\nwe have a pessimistic view of this material life, considering the distresses of\nbirth, death, old age and disease, there is no impetus for our making\nadvancement in spiritual life.\n\n\nAs for detachment from children, wife and home, it is not meant that one should\nhave no feeling for these. They are natural objects of affection, but when they\nare not favorable to spiritual progress, then one should not be attached to\nthem. The best process for making the home pleasant is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. If\none is in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, he can make his home very happy because this\nprocess of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is very easy. One need only chant Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a,\nHare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare,\naccept the remnants of foodstuffs offered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, have some discussion on\nbooks like Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, and engage oneself in Deity\nworship. These four will make one happy. One should train the members of his\nfamily in this way. The family members can sit down morning and evening and\nchant together Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/Hare R\u0101ma, Hare\nR\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare. If one can mold his family life in this way to\ndevelop K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, following these four principles, then there is no\nneed to change from family life to renounced life. But if it is not congenial,\nnot favorable for spiritual advancement, then family life should be abandoned.\nOne must sacrifice everything to realize or serve K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, just as Arjuna did.\nArjuna did not want to kill his family members, but when he understood that\nthese family members were impediments to his K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a realization, he accepted the\ninstruction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and fought and killed them. In all cases, one should be\ndetached from the happiness and distress of family life because in this world\none can never be fully happy or fully miserable. Happiness and distress are\nconcommitant factors of material life. One should learn to tolerate, as advised\nin Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. One can never restrict the coming and going of happiness and\ndistress, so one should be detached from the materialistic way of life and be\nautomatically equiposed in both cases. Generally, when we get something\ndesirable, we are very happy, and when we get something undesirable, we are\ndistressed. But if we are actually in the spiritual position, these things will\nnot agitate us. To reach that stage, we have to practice unbreakable devotional\nservice; devotional service to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a without deviation means engaging oneself in\nthe nine processes of devotional service, chanting, hearing, worshiping,\noffering respect, etc., as described in the last verse of the Ninth Chapter.\nThat process should be followed. Naturally, when one is adapted to the spiritual\nway of life, he will not want to mix with materialistic men. That would go\nagainst his grain. One may test himself by seeing how far he is inclined to live\nin a solitary place without unwanted association.\n\n\nNaturally a devotee has no taste for unnecessary sporting or cinema-going or\nenjoying some social function, because he understands that these are simply a\nwaste of time. There are many research scholars and philosophers who study sex\nlife or some other subject, but according to Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, such research work\nand philosophical speculation have no value. That is more or less nonsensical.\nAccording to Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, one should make research by philosophical discretion\ninto the nature of the soul. One should make research to understand with what\nthe self is concerned. That is recommended here.\n\n\nAs far as self-realization is concerned, it is clearly stated here that\nbhakti-yoga is especially practical. As soon as there is a question of devotion,\none must consider the relationship between the Supersoul and the individual\nsoul. The individual soul and the Supersoul cannot be one, at least not in the\nbhakti conception, the devotional conception of life. This service of the\nindividual soul to the Supreme Soul is eternal, nityam, as is clearly stated. So\nbhakti or devotional service is eternal. One should be established in that\nphilosophical conviction, otherwise it is only a waste of time, ignorance.\n\n\nIn the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, this is explained; vadanti tat tattva-vidas tattva\u1e41\nyaj j\u00f1\u0101nam advayam. \u201cThose who are actually knowers of the Absolute Truth know\nthat the Self is realized in three different phases as Brahman, Param\u0101tm\u0101 and\nBhagav\u0101n.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 1.2.11) Bhagav\u0101n is the last word in the realization of the\nAbsolute Truth; therefore one should reach up to that platform of understanding\nthe Supreme Personality of Godhead and thus engage in the devotional service of\nthe Lord. That is perfection of knowledge.\n\n\nBeginning from practicing humility up to the point of realization of the Supreme\nTruth, the Absolute Personality of Godhead, this process is just like a\nstaircase beginning from the ground floor up to the top floor. Now on this\nstaircase there are so many people who have reached the first floor, the second\nor third floor, etc., but unless one reaches the top floor, which is the\nunderstanding of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he is at a lower stage of knowledge. If anyone wants to\ncompete with God and at the same time make advancement in spiritual knowledge,\nhe will be frustrated. It is clearly stated that without humility understanding\nis harmful. To think oneself God is most puffed up. Although the living entity\nis always being kicked by the stringent laws of material nature, still he\nthinks, \u201cI am God\u201d because of ignorance. One should be humble and know that he\nis subordinate to the Supreme Lord. Due to rebellion against the Supreme Lord,\none becomes subordinate to material nature. One must know and be convinced of\nthis truth.\n\n\n13.13\n\n\nj\u00f1eya\u1e41 yat tat pravak\u1e63y\u0101mi\n\n\nyaj j\u00f1\u0101tv\u0101m\u1e5btam a\u015bnute\n\n\nan\u0101di mat-para\u1e41 brahma\n\n\nna sat tan n\u0101sad ucyate\n\n\nj\u00f1eyam\u2014knowable; yat\u2014that; tat\u2014which; pravak\u1e63y\u0101mi\u2014I shall now explain;\nyat\u2014which; j\u00f1\u0101tv\u0101\u2014knowing; am\u1e5btam\u2014nectar; a\u015bnute\u2014taste; an\u0101di\u2014beginningless;\nmat-param\u2014subordinate to Me; brahma\u2014spirit; na\u2014neither; sat\u2014cause; tat\u2014that;\nna\u2014nor; asat\u2014effect; ucyate\u2014is called.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nI shall now explain the knowable, knowing which you will taste the eternal. This\nis beginningless, and it is subordinate to Me. It is called Brahman, the spirit,\nand it lies beyond the cause and effect of this material world.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe Lord has explained the field of activities and the knower of the field. He\nhas also explained the process of knowing the knower of the field of activities.\nNow He is explaining the knowable, both the soul and the Supersoul respectively.\nBy knowledge of the knower, both the soul and the Supersoul, one can relish the\nnectar of life. As explained in the Second Chapter, the living entity is\neternal. This is also confirmed here. There is no specific date at which the\nj\u012bva was born. Nor can anyone trace out the history of j\u012bv\u0101tm\u0101\u2019s manifestation\nfrom the Supreme Lord. Therefore it is beginningless. The Vedic literature\nconfirms this: na j\u0101yate m\u1e5bjayate v\u0101 vipa\u015bcit. The knower of the body is never\nborn and never dies, and he is full of knowledge. The Supreme Lord is also\nstated in the Vedic literature as pradh\u0101na-k\u1e63etraj\u00f1a-patir gu\u1e47e\u015ba\u1e25. The Supreme\nLord as the Supersoul is the chief knower of the body, and He is the master of\nthe three modes of material nature. In the sm\u1e5bti it is said: d\u0101sa-bh\u016bto harer\neva n\u0101nyasvaiva kad\u0101cana. The living entities are eternally in the service of\nthe Supreme Lord. This is also confirmed by Lord Caitanya in His teaching;\ntherefore the description of Brahman mentioned in this verse is in relation to\nthe individual soul, and when the word Brahman is applied to the living entity,\nit is to be understood that he is vij\u00f1\u0101na\u1e41 brahma as opposed to ananta-brahma.\nAnanta-brahma is the Supreme Brahman Personality of Godhead.\n\n\n13.14\n\n\nsarvata\u1e25 p\u0101\u1e47i-p\u0101da\u1e41 tat\n\n\nsarvato \u2019k\u1e63i-\u015biro-mukham\n\n\nsarvata\u1e25 \u015brutimal loke\n\n\nsarvam \u0101v\u1e5btya ti\u1e63\u1e6dhati\n\n\nsarvata\u1e25\u2014everywhere; p\u0101\u1e47i\u2014hands; p\u0101dam\u2014legs; tat\u2014that; sarvata\u1e25\u2014everywhere;\nak\u1e63i\u2014eyes; \u015bira\u1e25\u2014head; mukham\u2014face; sarvata\u1e25\u2014everywhere; \u015brutimat\u2014hearing;\nloke\u2014in the world; sarvam\u2014everywhere, \u0101v\u1e5btya\u2014covering; ti\u1e63\u1e6dhati\u2014exists.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nEverywhere are His hands and legs, His eyes and faces, and He hears everything.\nIn this way the Supersoul exists.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nAs the sun exists diffusing its unlimited rays, so does the Supersoul, or\nSupreme Personality of Godhead. He exists in His all-pervading form, and in Him\nexist all the individual living entities, beginning from the first great\nteacher, Brahm\u0101, down to the small ants. There are unlimited heads, legs, hands\nand eyes, and unlimited living entities. All are existing in and on the\nSupersoul. Therefore the Supersoul is all-pervading. The individual soul,\nhowever, cannot say that he has his hands, legs and eyes everywhere. That is not\npossible. If he thinks that although under ignorance he is not conscious that\nhis hands and legs are diffused all over, but when he attains to proper\nknowledge he will come to that stage, his thinking is contradictory. This means\nthat the individual soul, having become conditioned by material nature, is not\nsupreme. The Supreme is different from the individual soul. The Supreme Lord can\nextend His hand without limit; the individual soul cannot. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 the\nLord says that if anyone offers Him a flower, or a fruit, or a little water, He\naccepts. If the Lord is a far distance away, how can He accept things? This is\nthe omnipotence of the Lord: even though He is situated in His own abode, far,\nfar away from earth, He can extend His hand to accept what anyone offers. That\nis His potency. In the Brahm\u0101-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 it is stated, goloka eva nivasati:\nalthough He is always engaged in pastimes in His transcendental planet, He is\nall-pervading. The individual soul cannot claim that he is all-pervading.\nTherefore this verse describes the Supreme Soul, the Personality of Godhead, not\nthe individual soul.\n\n\n13.15\n\n\nsarvendriya-gu\u1e47\u0101bh\u0101sa\u1e41\n\n\nsarvendriya-vivarjitam\n\n\nasakta\u1e41 sarva-bh\u1e5bc caiva\n\n\nnirgu\u1e47a\u1e41 gu\u1e47a-bhokt\u1e5b ca\n\n\nsarve\u2014all; indriya\u2014senses; gu\u1e47a\u2014qualities; \u0101bh\u0101sam\u2014original source; sarva\u2014all;\nindriya\u2014senses; vivarjitam\u2014being without; asaktam\u2014without attachment;\nsarva-bh\u1e5bt\u2014maintainer of everyone; ca\u2014also; eva\u2014certainly; nirgu\u1e47am\u2014without\nmaterial qualities; gu\u1e47a-bhokt\u1e5b\u2014simultaneously master of the gu\u1e47as; ca\u2014also.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThe Supersoul is the original source of all senses, yet He is without senses. He\nis unattached, although He is the maintainer of all living beings. He transcends\nthe modes of nature, and at the same time He is the master of all modes of\nmaterial nature.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe Supreme Lord, although the source of all the senses of the living entities,\ndoesn\u2019t have material senses like they have. Actually, the individual souls have\nspiritual senses, but in condemned life they are covered with the material\nelements and therefore the sense activities are exhibited through matter. The\nSupreme Lord\u2019s senses are not so covered. His senses are transcendental and are\ntherefore called nirgu\u1e47a. Gu\u1e47a means the material modes, but His senses are\nwithout material covering. It should be understood that His senses are not\nexactly like ours. Although He is the source of all our sensual activities, He\nhas His transcendental senses which are uncontaminated. This is very nicely\nexplained in the \u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad in the verse: sarvata\u1e25 p\u0101\u1e47i-p\u0101dam. The\nSupreme Personality of Godhead has no hands which are materially contaminated,\nbut He has His hands and accepts whatever sacrifice is offered to Him. That is\nthe distinction between the conditioned soul and the Supersoul. He has no\nmaterial eyes, but He has eyes\u2014otherwise how could He see? He sees everything,\npast, present and future. He lives within the heart of the living being, and He\nknows what we have done in the past, what we are doing now, and what is awaiting\nus in the future. This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101: He knows everything,\nbut no one knows Him. It is said that the Supreme Lord has no legs like us, but\nHe can travel throughout space because He has spiritual legs. In other words,\nthe Lord is not impersonal; He has His eyes, legs, hands and everything else,\nand because we are part and parcel of the Supreme Lord we also have these\nthings. But His hands, legs, eyes and senses are not contaminated by material\nnature.\n\n\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 also confirms that when the Lord appears He appears as He is by\nHis internal potency. He is not contaminated by the material energy because He\nis the Lord of material energy. In the Vedic literature we find that His whole\nembodiment is spiritual. He has His eternal form called sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha.\nHe is full of all opulence. He is the proprietor of all wealth and the owner of\nall energy. He is the most intelligent and is full of knowledge. These are some\nof the symptoms of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is maintainer of all\nliving entities and the witness of all activities. As far as we can understand\nfrom Vedic literature, the Supreme Lord is always transcendental. Although we do\nnot see His head, face, hands, or legs, He has them, and when we are elevated to\nthe transcendental situation then we can see the Lord\u2019s form. Due to materially\ncontaminated senses, we cannot see His form. Therefore the impersonalists who\nare still materially affected cannot understand the Personality of Godhead.\n\n\n13.16\n\n\nbahir anta\u015b ca bh\u016bt\u0101n\u0101m\n\n\nacara\u1e41 caram eva ca\n\n\ns\u016bk\u1e63matv\u0101t tad avij\u00f1eya\u1e41\n\n\nd\u016bra-stha\u1e41 c\u0101ntike ca tat\n\n\nbahi\u1e25\u2014outside; anta\u1e25\u2014inside; ca\u2014also; bh\u016bt\u0101n\u0101m\u2014of all living entities;\nacaram\u2014not moving; caram\u2014moving; eva\u2014also; ca\u2014and; s\u016bk\u1e63matv\u0101t\u2014on account of\nbeing subtle; tat\u2014that; avij\u00f1eyam\u2014unknowable; d\u016brastha\u1e41\u2014far away; ca antike\u2014near\nalso; ca\u2014and; tat\u2014that.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThe Supreme Truth exists both internally and externally, in the moving and\nnonmoving. He is beyond the power of the material senses to see or to know.\nAlthough far, far away, He is also near to all.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nIn Vedic literature we understand that N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, the Supreme Person, is residing\nboth outside and inside of every living entity. He is present both in the\nspiritual and material world. Although He is far, far away, still He is near to\nus. These are the statements of Vedic literature. \u0100s\u012bno d\u016bra\u1e41 vrajati \u015bay\u0101no\ny\u0101ti sarvata\u1e25. And, because He is always engaged in transcendental bliss, we\ncannot understand how He is enjoying His full opulence. We cannot see or\nunderstand with these material senses. Therefore in the Vedic language it is\nsaid that to understand Him our material mind and senses cannot act. But one who\nhas purified his mind and senses by practicing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness in devotional\nservice can see Him constantly. It is confirmed in Brahm\u0101-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 that the\ndevotee who has developed love for the Supreme God can see Him always, without\ncessation. And it is confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (11.54) that He can be seen and\nunderstood only by devotional service.

He is\nsituated as one. Although He is the maintainer of every living entity, it is to\nbe understood that He devours and develops all.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe Lord is situated in everyone\u2019s heart as the Supersoul. Does that mean that\nHe has become divided? No. Actually, He is one. The example is given of the sun:\nthe sun, at the meridian, is situated in his place. But if one goes for five\nthousand miles in all directions and asks, \u201cWhere is the sun?\u201d everyone will say\nthat it is shining on his head. In the Vedic literature this example is given to\nshow that although He is undivided, He is situated as if divided. Also it is\nsaid in Vedic literature that one Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is present everywhere by His\nomnipotence, just as the sun appears in many places to many persons. And the\nSupreme Lord, although the maintainer of every living entity, devours everything\nat the time of annihilation. This was confirmed in the Eleventh Chapter when the\nLord said that He has come to devour all the warriors assembled at Kuruk\u1e63etra.\nHe also mentions that in the form of time He devours also. He is the\nannihilator, the killer of all. When there is creation, He develops all from\ntheir original state, and at the time of annihilation He devours them. The Vedic\nhymns confirm the fact that He is the origin of all living entities and the rest\nof al1. After creation, everything rests in His omnipotence, and after\nannihilation, everything again returns to rest in Him. These are the\nconfirmations of Vedic hymns.

He is beyond the darkness of\nmatter and is unmanifested. He is knowledge, He is the object of knowledge, and\nHe is the goal of knowledge. He is situated in everyone\u2019s heart.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe Supersoul, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the source of light in all\nluminous objects like the sun, moon, stars, etc. In the Vedic literature we find\nthat in the spiritual kingdom there is no need of sun or moon because the\neffulgence of the Supreme Lord is there. In the material world that brahmajyoti\nthe Lord\u2019s spiritual effulgence, is covered by the mahat-tattva, the material\nelements; therefore in this material world we require the assistance of sun,\nmoon, electricity, etc., for light. But in the spiritual world there is no need\nof such things. It is clearly stated in the Vedic literature that because of His\nluminous effulgence, everything is illuminated. It is clear, therefore, that His\nsituation is not in the material world. He is situated in the spiritual world\nwhich is far, far away in the spiritual sky. That is also confirmed in the Vedic\nliterature. \u0100ditya-var\u1e47am tamasa\u1e25 parast\u0101t. He is just like the sun, eternally\nluminous, but He is far, far beyond the darkness of this material world. His\nknowledge is transcendental. The Vedic literature confirms that Brahman is\nconcentrated transcendental knowledge. To one who is anxious to be transferred\nto that spiritual world, knowledge is given by the Supreme Lord who is situated\nin everyone\u2019s heart.\n\n\nOne Vedic mantra says: ta\u1e41 ha devam \u0101tma-buddhi-prak\u0101\u015ba\u1e41 mumuk\u1e63ur vai \u015bara\u1e47am\naham prapadye. One must surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead if he\nat all wants liberation. As far as the goal of ultimate knowledge is concerned,\nit is also confirmed in Vedic literature: tam eva viditv\u0101tim\u1e5btyum eti. \u201cOnly by\nknowing You can one surpass the boundary of birth and death.\u201d He is situated in\neveryone\u2019s heart as the supreme controller. The Supreme has legs and hands\ndistributed everywhere, and this cannot be said of the individual soul.\nTherefore that there are two knowers of the field of activity, the individual\nsoul and the Supersoul, must be admitted. One\u2019s hands and legs are distributed\nlocally, but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s hands and legs are distributed everywhere. This is\nconfirmed in the \u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad: sarvasya prabhum \u012b\u015b\u0101na\u1e41 sarvasya \u015bara\u1e47a\u1e41\nb\u1e5bhat. That Supreme Personality of Godhead, Supersoul, is the prabhu or master\nof all living entities; therefore He is the ultimate center of all living\nentities. So there is no denying the fact that the Supreme Supersoul and the\nindividual soul are always different.\n\n\n13.19\n\n\niti k\u1e63etra\u1e41 tath\u0101 j\u00f1\u0101na\u1e41\n\n\nj\u00f1eya\u1e41 cokta\u1e41 sam\u0101sata\u1e25\n\n\nmad-bhakta etad vij\u00f1\u0101ya\n\n\nmad-bh\u0101v\u0101yopapadyate\n\n\niti\u2014thus; k\u1e63etram\u2014field of activities (the body); tath\u0101\u2014also; j\u00f1\u0101nam\u2014knowledge;\nj\u00f1eyam\u2014knowable; ca\u2014also; uktam\u2014describe; sam\u0101sata\u1e25\u2014in summary; mat-bhakta\u1e25\u2014My\ndevotee; etat\u2014all this; vij\u00f1\u0101ya\u2014after understanding; mat-bh\u0101v\u0101ya\u2014My nature;\nupapadyate\u2014attains.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThus the field of activities [the body], knowledge, and the knowable have been\nsummarily described by Me. Only My devotees can understand this thoroughly and\nthus attain to My nature.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe Lord has described in summary the body, knowledge and the knowable. This\nknowledge is of three things: the knower, the knowable and the process of\nknowing. Combined, these are called vij\u00f1\u0101nam, or the science of knowledge.\nPerfect knowledge can be understood by the unalloyed devotees of the Lord\ndirectly. Others are unable to understand. The monists say that at the ultimate\nstage these three items become one, but the devotees do not accept this.\nKnowledge and development of knowledge mean understanding oneself in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness. We are being led by material consciousness, but as soon as we\ntransfer all consciousness to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s activities and realize that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is\neverything, then we attain real knowledge. In other words, knowledge is nothing\nbut the preliminary stage of understanding devotional service perfectly.\n\n\n13.20\n\n\nprak\u1e5bti\u1e41 puru\u1e63a\u1e41 caiva\n\n\nviddhy an\u0101d\u012b ubh\u0101v api\n\n\nvik\u0101r\u0101\u1e41\u015b ca gu\u1e47\u0101\u1e41\u015b caiva\n\n\nviddhi prak\u1e5bti-sambhav\u0101n\n\n\nprak\u1e5btim\u2014material nature; puru\u1e63am\u2014living entities; ca\u2014also; eva\u2014certainly;\nviddhi\u2014must know; an\u0101d\u012b\u2014without beginning; ubhau\u2014both; api\u2014also;\nvik\u0101r\u0101n\u2014transformation; ca\u2014also; gu\u1e47\u0101n\u2014three modes of nature; ca\u2014also;\neva\u2014certainly; viddhi\u2014know; prak\u1e5bti\u2014material nature; sambhav\u0101n\u2014produced of.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nMaterial nature and the living entities should be understood to be\nbeginningless. Their transformations and the modes of matter are products of\nmaterial nature.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nBy this knowledge, the body, the field of activities and the knowers of the body\n(both the individual soul and the Supersoul) can be known. The body is the field\nof activity and is composed of material nature. It is the individual soul which\nis embodied. Enjoying the activities of the body is the puru\u1e63a, or the living\nentity. He is one knower, and the other is the Supersoul. Of course, it is to be\nunderstood that both the Supersoul and the individual entity are different\nmanifestations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The living entity is in\nthe category of His energy, and the Supersoul is in the category of His personal\nexpansion.\n\n\nBoth material nature and the living entity are eternal. That is to say that they\nexisted before the creation. The material manifestation is from the energy of\nthe Supreme Lord and so also are the living entities, but they are of the\nsuperior energy. Both of them existed before this cosmos was manifested.\nMaterial nature was absorbed in the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Mah\u0101-Vis\u1e47u,\nand when it was required, it was manifested by the agency of mahat-tattva.\nSimilarly, the living entities are also in Him, and because they are\nconditioned, they are adverse to serving the Supreme Lord. Thus they are not\nallowed to enter into the spiritual sky. After the winding up of material\nnature, these living entities are again given a chance to act in the material\nworld and prepare themselves to enter into the spiritual world. That is the\nmystery of this material creation. Actually the living entity is originally the\nspiritual part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, but due to his rebellious nature,\nhe is conditioned within material nature. It really does not matter how these\nliving entities or superior entities of the Supreme Lord have come in contact\nwith material nature. The Supreme Personality of Godhead knows, however, how and\nwhy this actually took place. In the scriptures the Lord says that those\nattracted by this material nature are undergoing a hard struggle for existence.\nBut we should know it with certainty from the descriptions of these few verses\nthat all the transformations and influences of material nature by the three\nmodes are also productions of material nature. All transformations and variety\nin respect to living entities are due to the body. As far as spirit is\nconcerned, living entities are all the same.\n\n\n13.21\n\n\nk\u0101rya-k\u0101ra\u1e47a-kart\u1e5btve\n\n\nhetu\u1e25 prak\u1e5btir ucyate\n\n\npuru\u1e63a\u1e25 sukha-du\u1e25kh\u0101n\u0101\u1e41\n\n\nbhokt\u1e5btve hetur ucyate\n\n\nk\u0101rya\u2014effect; k\u0101ra\u1e47a\u2014cause; kart\u1e5btve\u2014in the matter of creation;\nhetu\u1e25\u2014instrument; prak\u1e5bti\u1e25\u2014material nature; ucyate\u2014is said to be; puru\u1e63a\u1e25\u2014the\nliving entities; sukha\u2014happiness; du\u1e25kh\u0101n\u0101m\u2014of distresses; bhokt\u1e5btve\u2014in\nenjoyment; hetu\u1e25\u2014instrument; ucyate\u2014is said to be.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nNature is said to be the cause of all material activities and effects, whereas\nthe living entity is the cause of the various sufferings and enjoyments in this\nworld.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe different manifestations of body and senses among the living entities are\ndue to material nature. There are 8,400,000 different species of life, and these\nvarieties are the creation of the material nature. They arise from the different\nsensual pleasures of the 1iving entity, who thus desires to live in this body or\nthat. When he is put into different bodies, he enjoys different kinds of\nhappiness and distress. His material happiness and distress are due to his body,\nand not to himself as he is. In his original state there is no doubt of\nenjoyment; therefore that is his real state. Because of the desire to lord it\nover material nature, he is in the material world. In the spiritual world there\nis no such thing. The spiritual world is pure, but in the material world\neveryone is struggling hard to acquire victims who present different pleasures\nto the body. It might be more clear to state that this body is the effect of the\nsenses. The senses are instruments for gratifying desire. Now, the sum\ntotal\u2014body and instrument senses\u2014are offered by material nature, and, as will be\nclear in the next verse, the living entity is blessed or damned with\ncircumstances according to his past desire and activity. According to one\u2019s\ndesires and activities, material nature places one in various residential\nquarters. The being himself is the cause of his attaining such residential\nquarters and his attendant enjoyment or suffering. Once placed in some\nparticular kind of body, he comes under the control of nature because the body,\nbeing matter, acts according to the laws of nature. At that time, the 1iving\nentity has no power to change that law. Suppose an entity is put into the body\nof a dog. As soon as he is put into the body of a dog, he must act like a dog.\nHe cannot act otherwise. And if the living entity is put into the body of a hog,\nthen he is forced to eat stool and act like a hog. Similarly, if the living\nentity is put into the body of a demigod, he must act according to his body.\nThis is the law of nature. But in all circumstances, the Supersoul is with the\nindividual soul. That is explained in the Vedas as follows: dv\u0101 supar\u1e47\u0101 sayuj\u0101\nsakh\u0101y\u0101. The Supreme Lord is so kind upon the living entity that He always\naccompanies the individual soul and in all circumstances is present as the\nSupersoul or Param\u0101tm\u0101.\n\n\n13.22\n\n\npuru\u1e63a\u1e25 prak\u1e5bti-stho hi\n\n\nbhu\u1e45kte prak\u1e5bti-j\u0101n gu\u1e47\u0101n\n\n\nk\u0101ra\u1e47a\u1e41 gu\u1e47a-sa\u1e45go \u2019sya\n\n\nsad-asad-yoni-janmasu\n\n\npuru\u1e63a\u1e25\u2014the living entity; prak\u1e5bti-stha\u1e25\u2014being situated in the material energy;\nhi\u2014certainly; bhu\u1e45kte\u2014enjoys; prak\u1e5bti-j\u0101n\u2014produced by the material nature;\ngu\u1e47\u0101n\u2014modes of nature; k\u0101ra\u1e47am\u2014cause; gu\u1e47a-sa\u1e45ga\u1e25\u2014association with the modes of\nnature; asya\u2014of the living entity; sat-asat\u2014good and bad; yoni\u2014species of life;\njanmasu\u2014birth.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThe living entity in material nature thus follows the ways of life, enjoying the\nthree modes of nature. This is due to his association with that material nature.\nThus he meets with good and evil amongst various species.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThis verse is very important for an understanding of how the living entities\ntransmigrate from one body to another. It is explained in the Second Chapter\nthat the living entity is transmigrating from one body to another just as one\nchanges dress. This change of dress is due to his attachment to material\nexistence. As long as he is captivated by this false manifestation, he has to\ncontinue transmigrating from one body to another. Due to his desire to lord it\nover material nature, he is put into such undesirable circumstances. Under the\ninfluence of material desire, the entity is born sometimes as a demigod,\nsometimes as a man, sometimes as a beast, as a bird, as a worm, as an aquatic,\nas a saintly man, as a bug. This is going on. And in all cases the living entity\nthinks himself to be the master of his circumstances, yet he is under the\ninfluence of material nature.\n\n\nHow he is put into such different bodies is explained here. It is due to\nassociation with the different modes of nature. One has to rise, therefore,\nabove the three material modes and become situated in the transcendental\nposition. That is called K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Unless one is situated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness, his material consciousness will oblige him to transfer from one\nbody to another because he has material desires since time immemorial. But he\nhas to change that conception. That change can be effected only by hearing from\nauthoritative sources. The best example is here: Arjuna is hearing the science\nof God from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The living entity, if he submits to this hearing process,\nwill lose his long-cherished desire to dominate material nature, and gradually\nand proportionately, as he reduces his long desire to dominate, he comes to\nenjoy spiritual happiness. In a Vedic mantra it is said that as he becomes\nlearned in association with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he\nproportionately relishes his eternal blissful life.\n\n\n13.23\n\n\nupadra\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101numant\u0101 ca\n\n\nbhart\u0101 bhokt\u0101 mahe\u015bvara\u1e25\n\n\nparam\u0101tmeti c\u0101py ukto\n\n\ndehe \u2019smin puru\u1e63a\u1e25 para\u1e25\n\n\nupadra\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u2014overseer; anumant\u0101\u2014permitter; ca\u2014also; bhart\u0101\u2014master; bhokt\u0101\u2014supreme\nenjoyer; mahe\u015bvara\u1e25\u2014the Supreme Lord; param\u0101tm\u0101\u2014Supersoul; iti\u2014also; ca\u2014and; api\nukta\u1e25\u2014is said; dehe\u2014in this body; asmin\u2014this; puru\u1e63a\u1e25\u2014enjoyer;\npara\u1e25\u2014transcendental.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nYet in this body there is another, a transcendental enjoyer who is the Lord, the\nsupreme proprietor, who exists as the overseer and permitter, and who is known\nas the Supersoul.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nIt is stated here that the Supersoul, who is always with the individual soul, is\nthe representation of the Supreme Lord. He is not an ordinary living entity.\nBecause the monist philosophers take the knower of the body to be one, they\nthink that there is no difference between the Supersoul and the individual soul.\nTo clarify this, the Lord says that He is the representation of Param\u0101tm\u0101 in\nevery body. He is different from the individual soul; He is para\u1e25,\ntranscendental. The individual soul enjoys the activities of a particular field,\nbut the Supersoul is present not as finite enjoyer nor as one taking part in\nbodily activities, but as the witness, overseer, permitter and supreme enjoyer.\nHis name is Param\u0101tm\u0101, not \u0101tm\u0101, and He is transcendental. It is distinctly\nclear that the \u0101tm\u0101 and Param\u0101tm\u0101 are different. The Supersoul, the Param\u0101tm\u0101,\nhas legs and hands everywhere, but the individual soul does not. And because He\nis the Supreme Lord, He is present within to sanction the individual soul\u2019s\ndesiring material enjoyment. Without the sanction of the Supreme Soul, the\nindividual soul cannot do anything. The individual is bhakta or the sustained,\nand He is bhukta or the maintainer. There are innumerable living entities, and\nHe is staying in them as a friend.\n\n\nThe fact is that individual living entities are eternally part and parcel of the\nSupreme Lord, and both of them are very intimately related as friends. But the\nliving entity has the tendency to reject the sanction of the Supreme Lord and\nact independantly in an attempt to dominate the supreme nature, and because he\nhas this tendency, he is called the marginal energy of the Supreme Lord. The\nliving entity can be situated either in the material energy or the spiritual\nenergy. As long as he is conditioned by the material energy, the Supreme Lord,\nas his friend, the Supersoul, stays with him just to get him to return to the\nspiritual energy. The Lord is always eager to take him back to the spiritual\nenergy, but due to his minute independence, the individual entity is continually\nrejecting the association of spiritual light. This misuse of independence is the\ncause of his material strife in the conditioned nature. The Lord, therefore, is\nalways giving instruction from within and from without. From without He gives\ninstructions as stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, and from within He tries to convince\nhim that his activities in the material field are not conducive to real\nhappiness. \u201cJust give it up and turn your faith toward Me. Then you will be\nhappy,\u201d He says. Thus the intelligent person who places his faith in the\nParam\u0101tm\u0101 or the Supreme Personality of Godhead begins to advance toward a\nblissful eternal life of knowledge\n\n\n13.24\n\n\nya eva\u1e41 vetti puru\u1e63a\u1e41\n\n\nprak\u1e5bti\u1e41 ca gu\u1e47ai\u1e25 saha\n\n\nsarvath\u0101 vartam\u0101no \u2019pi\n\n\nna sa bh\u016byo \u2019bhij\u0101yate\n\n\nya\u1e25\u2014anyone; evam\u2014thus; vetti\u2014understands; puru\u1e63am\u2014the living entities;\nprak\u1e5btim\u2014material nature; ca\u2014and; gu\u1e47ai\u1e25\u2014modes of material nature; saha\u2014with;\nsarvath\u0101\u2014by all means; vartam\u0101na\u1e25\u2014situated; api\u2014in spite of; na\u2014never; sa\u1e25\u2014he;\nbh\u016bya\u1e25\u2014again; abhij\u0101yate\u2014takes his birth.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nOne who understands this philosophy concerning material nature, the living\nentity and the interaction of the modes of nature is sure to attain liberation.\nHe will not take birth here again, regardless of his present position.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nClear understanding of material nature, the Supersoul, the individual soul and\ntheir interrelation makes one eligible to become liberated and turn to the\nspiritual atmosphere without being forced to return to this material nature.\nThis is the result of knowledge. The purpose of knowledge is to understand\ndistinctly that the living entity has by chance fallen into this material\nexistence. By his personal endeavor in association with authorities, saintly\npersons and a spiritual master, he has to understand his position and then\nrevert to spiritual consciousness or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness by understanding\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 as it is explained by the Personality of Godhead. Then it is\ncertain that he will never come again into this material existence; he will be\ntransferred into the spiritual world for a blissful eternal life of knowledge.\n\n\n13.25\n\n\ndhy\u0101nen\u0101tmani pa\u015byanti\n\n\nkecid \u0101tm\u0101nam \u0101tman\u0101\n\n\nanye s\u0101\u1e45khyena yogena\n\n\nkarma-yogena c\u0101pare\n\n\ndhy\u0101nena\u2014by meditation; \u0101tmani\u2014self; pa\u015byanti\u2014see; kecit\u2014one; \u0101tm\u0101nam\u2014Supersoul;\n\u0101tman\u0101\u2014by the mind; anye\u2014others; s\u0101\u1e45khyena\u2014by philosophical discussion;\nyogena\u2014by the yoga system; karma-yogena\u2014by activities without fruitive desire;\nca\u2014also; apare\u2014others.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThat Supersoul is perceived by some through meditation, by some through the\ncultivation of knowledge, and by others through working without fruitive desire.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe Lord informs Arjuna that the conditioned soul can be divided into two\nclasses as far as man\u2019s search for self-realization is concerned. Those who are\natheists, agnostics and skeptics are beyond the sense of spiritual\nunderstanding. But there are others who are faithful in their understanding of\nspiritual life, and they are called workers who have renounced fruitive results.\nThose who always try to establish the doctrine of monism are also counted among\nthe atheists and agnostics. In other words, only the devotees of the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead are really capable of spiritual understanding because\nthey understand that beyond this material nature there is the spiritual world\nand the Supreme Personality of Godhead who is expanded as the Param\u0101tm\u0101, the\nSupersoul in everyone, the all-pervading Godhead. Of course there are those who\ntry to understand the Supreme Absolute Truth by cultivation of knowledge, and\nthey can be counted in the second class. The atheistic philosophers analyze this\nmaterial world into twenty-four elements, and they place the individual soul as\nthe twenty-fifth item. When they are able to understand the nature of the\nindividual soul to be transcendental to the material elements, they are able to\nunderstand also that above the individual soul there is the Supreme Personality\nof Godhead. He is the twenty-sixth element. Thus gradually they also come to the\nstandard of devotional service in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Those who work without\nfruitive results are also perfect in their attitude. They are given a chance to\nadvance to the platform of devotional service in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Here it is\nstated that there are some people who are pure in consciousness and who try to\nfind out the Supersoul by meditation, and when they discover the Supersoul\nwithin themselves, they become transcendentally situated. Similarly, there are\nothers who also try to understand the Supreme Soul by cultivation of knowledge,\nand there are others who cultivate the ha\u1e6dha-yoga system and who try to satisfy\nthe Supreme Personality of Godhead by childish activities.\n\n\n13.26\n\n\nanye tv evam aj\u0101nanta\u1e25\n\n\n\u015brutv\u0101nyebhya up\u0101sate\n\n\nte \u2019pi c\u0101titaranty eva\n\n\nm\u1e5btyu\u1e41 \u015bruti-par\u0101ya\u1e47\u0101\u1e25\n\n\nanye\u2014others; tu\u2014but; evam\u2014this; aj\u0101nanta\u1e25\u2014without spiritual knowledge; \u015brutv\u0101\u2014by\nhearing; anyebhya\u1e25\u2014from others; up\u0101sate\u2014begin to worship; te\u2014they; api\u2014also;\nca\u2014and; atitaranti\u2014transcend; eva\u2014certainly; m\u1e5btyum\u2014the path of death;\n\u015bruti-par\u0101ya\u1e47\u0101\u1e25\u2014inclined to the process of hearing.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nAgain there are those who, although not conversant in spiritual knowledge, begin\nto worship the Supreme Person upon hearing about Him from others. Because of\ntheir tendency to hear from authorities, they also transcend the path of birth\nand death.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThis verse is particularly applicable to modern society because in modern\nsociety there is practically no education in spiritual matters. Some of the\npeople may appear to be atheistic or agnostic or philosophical, but actually\nthere is no knowledge of philosophy. As for the common man, if he is a good\nsoul, then there is a chance for advancement by hearing. This hearing process is\nvery important. Lord Caitanya, who preached K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness in the modern\nworld, gave great stress to hearing because if the common man simply hears from\nauthoritative sources, he can progress, especially, according to Lord Caitanya,\nif he hears the transcendental vibration Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a,\nHare Hare/Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare. It is stated, therefore,\nthat all men should take advantage of hearing from realized souls and gradually\nbecome able to understand everything. The worship of the Supreme Lord will then\nundoubtedly take place. Lord Caitanya has said that in this age no one needs to\nchange his position, but one should give up the endeavor to understand the\nAbsolute Truth by speculative reasoning. One should learn to become the servant\nof those who are in knowledge of the Supreme Lord. If one is fortunate enough to\ntake shelter of a pure devotee, hear from him about self-realization and follow\nin his footsteps, he will be gradually elevated to the position of a pure\ndevotee. In this verse particularly the process of hearing is strongly\nrecommended, and this is very appropriate. Although the common man is often not\nas capable as so-called philosophers, faithful hearing from an authoritative\nperson will help one transcend this material existence and go back to Godhead,\nback to home.\n\n\n13.27\n\n\ny\u0101vat sa\u00f1j\u0101yate ki\u00f1cit\n\n\nsattva\u1e41 sth\u0101vara-ja\u1e45gamam\n\n\nk\u1e63etra-k\u1e63etraj\u00f1a-sa\u1e41yog\u0101t\n\n\ntad viddhi bharatar\u1e63abha\n\n\ny\u0101vat\u2014whatever; sa\u1e41j\u0101yate\u2014takes place; ki\u00f1cit\u2014anything; sattvam\u2014existence;\nsth\u0101vara\u2014not moving; ja\u1e45gamam\u2014moving; k\u1e63etra\u2014the body; k\u1e63etraj\u00f1a\u2014knower of the\nbody; sa\u1e41yog\u0101t\u2014union between; tat viddhi\u2014you must know it; bharatar\u1e63abha\u2014O chief\nof the Bh\u0101ratas.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nO chief of the Bh\u0101ratas, whatever you see in existence, both moving and\nunmoving, is only the combination of the field of activities and the knower of\nthe field.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nBoth material nature and the living entity, which were existing before the\ncreation of the cosmos, are explained in this verse. Whatever is created is but\na combination of the living entity and material nature. There are many\nmanifestations like trees, mountains and hills, which are not moving, and there\nare many existences which are moving, and all of them are but combinations of\nmaterial nature and superior nature, the living entity. Without the touch of the\nsuperior nature, the living entity, nothing can grow. Therefore the relationship\nbetween matter and nature is eternally going on, and this combination is\neffected by the Supreme Lord; therefore He is the controller of both the\nsuperior and inferior natures. The material nature is created by Him, and the\nsuperior nature is placed in this material nature, and thus all these activities\nand manifestations take place.\n\n\n13.28\n\n\nsama\u1e41 sarve\u1e63u bh\u016bte\u1e63u\n\n\nti\u1e63\u1e6dhanta\u1e41 parame\u015bvaram\n\n\nvina\u015byatsv avina\u015byanta\u1e41\n\n\nya\u1e25 pa\u015byati sa pa\u015byati\n\n\nsamam\u2014equally; sarve\u1e63u\u2014in all; bh\u016bte\u1e63u\u2014living entities; ti\u1e63\u1e6dhantam\u2014residing;\nparame\u015bvaram\u2014the Supersoul; vina\u015byatsu\u2014in the destructible; avina\u015byantam\u2014not\ndestroyed; ya\u1e25\u2014anyone; pa\u015byati\u2014see; sa\u1e25\u2014he; pa\u015byati\u2014actually sees.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nOne who sees the Supersoul accompanying the individual soul in all bodies and\nwho understands that neither the soul nor the Supersoul is ever destroyed,\nactually sees.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nAnyone who can see three things\u2014the body, the proprietor of the body, or\nindividual soul, and the friend of the individual soul, combined together by\ngood association\u2014is actually in knowledge.

The Sanskrit\nword parame\u015bvaram is sometimes translated as the individual soul because the\nsoul is the master of the body, and after the destruction of the body he\ntransfers to another form. In that way he is master. But there are others who\ninterpret this parame\u015bvaram to be the Supersoul. In either case, both the\nSupersoul and the individual soul continue. They are not destroyed.

No one\nin science can ascertain this.\n\n\n13.34\n\n\nyath\u0101 prak\u0101\u015bayaty eka\u1e25\n\n\nk\u1e5btsna\u1e41 lokam ima\u1e41 ravi\u1e25\n\n\nk\u1e63etra\u1e41 k\u1e63etr\u012b tath\u0101 k\u1e5btsna\u1e41\n\n\nprak\u0101\u015bayati bh\u0101rata\n\n\nyath\u0101\u2014as; prak\u0101\u015bayati\u2014illuminates; eka\u1e25\u2014one; k\u1e5btsnam\u2014the whole; lokam\u2014universe;\nimam\u2014this; ravi\u1e25\u2014the sun, k\u1e63etram\u2014this body; k\u1e63etr\u012b\u2014the soul; tath\u0101\u2014similarly;\nk\u1e5btsnam\u2014all; prak\u0101\u015bayati\u2014illuminates; bh\u0101rata\u2014O son of Bharata.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nO son of Bharata, as the sun alone illuminates all this universe, so does the\nliving entity, one within the body, illuminate the entire body by consciousness.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThere are various theories regarding consciousness. Here in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 the\nexample of the sun and the sunshine is given. As the sun is situated in one\nplace, but is illuminating the whole universe, so a small particle of spirit\nsoul, although situated in the heart of this body, is illuminating the whole\nbody by consciousness. Thus consciousness is the proof of the presence of the\nsoul, as sunshine or light is the proof of the presence of the sun.\n\n\nWhen the soul is present in the body, there is consciousness all over the body,\nand as soon as the soul has passed from the body, there is no more\nconsciousness. This can be easily understood by any intelligent man. Therefore\nconsciousness is not a production of the combinations of matter. It is the\nsymptom of the living entity. The consciousness of the living entity, although\nqualitatively one with the supreme consciousness, is not supreme because the\nconsciousness of one particular body does not share that of another body. But\nthe Supersoul, which is situated in all bodies as the friend of the individual\nsoul, is conscious of all bodies. That is the difference between supreme\nconsciousness and individual consciousness.\n\n\n13.35\n\n\nk\u1e63etra-k\u1e63etraj\u00f1ayor evam\n\n\nantara\u1e41 j\u00f1\u0101na-cak\u1e63u\u1e63\u0101\n\n\nbh\u016bta-prak\u1e5bti-mok\u1e63a\u1e41 ca\n\n\nye vidur y\u0101nti te param\n\n\nk\u1e63etra\u2014body; k\u1e63etraj\u00f1ayo\u1e25\u2014of the proprietor of the body; evam\u2014that;\nantaram\u2014difference; j\u00f1\u0101na-cak\u1e63u\u1e63\u0101\u2014by vision of knowledge; bh\u016bta\u2014living entity;\nprak\u1e5bti\u2014material nature; mok\u1e63am\u2014liberation; ca\u2014also; ye\u2014one who; vidu\u1e25\u2014knows;\ny\u0101nti\u2014approaches; te\u2014they; param\u2014Supreme.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nOne who knowingly sees this difference between the body and the owner of the\nbody and can understand the process of liberation from this bondage, also\nattains to the supreme goal.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe purport of this Thirteenth Chapter is that one should know the distinction\nbetween the body, the owner of the body, and the Supersoul. A faithful person\nshould at first have some good association to hear of God and thus gradually\nbecome enlightened. If one accepts a spiritual master, he can learn to\ndistinguish between matter and spirit, and that becomes the steppingstone for\nfurther spiritual realization. A spiritual master teaches his students to get\nfree from the material concept of life by various instructions. For instance, in\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 we find K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a instructing Arjuna to free him from materialistic\nconsiderations.\n\n\nOne can understand that this body is matter; it can be analyzed with its\ntwenty-four elements. That is the gross manifestation. And the subtle\nmanifestation is the mind and psychological effects. And the symptoms of life\nare the interaction of these features. But over and above this, there is the\nsoul, and there is also the Supersoul. The soul and the Supersoul are two. This\nmaterial world is working by the conjunction of the soul and the twenty-four\nmaterial elements. One who can see the constitution of the whole material\nmanifestation as this combination of the soul and material elements and also can\nsee the situation of the Supreme Soul becomes eligible for transfer to the\nspiritual world. These things are meant for contemplation and for realization,\nand one should have a complete understanding of this chapter with the help of\nthe spiritual master.",

TRANSLATION  Arjuna said: O my dear K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, I wish to know about prak\u1e5bti [nature], Puru\u1e63a [the\nenjoyer], and the field and the knower of the field, and of knowledge and the\nend of knowledge. The Blessed Lord then said: This body, O son of Kunt\u012b, is\ncalled the field, and one who knows this body is called the knower of the field.  PURPORT  Arjuna was inquisitive about prak\u1e5bti or nature, puru\u1e63a, the enjoyer, k\u1e63etra, the\nfield, k\u1e63etraj\u00f1a, its knower, and of knowledge and the object of knowledge. When\nhe inquired about all these, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a said that this body is called the field and\nthat one who knows this body is called the knower of the field. This body is the\nfield of activity for the conditioned soul. The conditioned soul is entrapped in\nmaterial existence, and he attempts to lord over material nature. And so,\naccording to his capacity to dominate material nature, he gets a field of\nactivity. That field of activity is the body. And what is the body? The body is\nmade of senses. The conditioned soul wants to enjoy sense gratification, and,\naccording to his capacity to enjoy sense gratification, he is offered a body, or\nfield of activity. Therefore the body is called k\u1e63etra, or the field of activity\nfor the conditioned soul. Now, the person who does not identify himself with the\nbody is called k\u1e63etraj\u00f1a, the knower of the field. It is not very difficult to\nunderstand the difference between the field and its knower, the body and the\nknower of the body. Any person can consider that from childhood to old age he\nundergoes so many changes of body and yet is still one person, remaining. Thus\nthere is a difference between the knower of the field of activities and the\nactual field of activities. A living conditioned soul can thus understand that\nhe is different from the body. It is described in the beginning\u2014dehe \u2019smin\u2014that\nthe living entity is within the body and that the body is changing from\nchildhood to boyhood and from boyhood to youth and from youth to old age, and\nthe person who owns the body knows that the body is changing. The owner is\ndistinctly k\u1e63etraj\u00f1a. Sometimes we understand that I am happy, I am mad, I am a\nwoman, I am a dog, I am a cat: these are the knowers. The knower is different\nfrom the field. Although we use many articles\u2014our clothes, etc.\u2014we know- that we\nare different from the things used. Similarly, we also understand by a little\ncontemplation that we are different from the body.  In the first six chapters of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, the knower of the body, the living\nentity, and the position by which he can understand the Supreme Lord are\ndescribed. In the middle six chapters of the G\u012bt\u0101, the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead and the relationship between the individual soul and the Supersoul in\nregard to devotional service are described. The superior position of the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead and the subordinate position of the individual soul are\ndefinitely defined in these chapters. The living entities are subordinate under\nall circumstances, but in their forgetfulness they are suffering. When\nenlightened by pious activities, they approach the Supreme Lord in different\ncapacities\u2014as the distressed, those in want of money, the inquisitive, and those\nin search of knowledge. That is also described. Now, starting with the\nThirteenth Chapter, how the living entity comes into contact with material\nnature, how he is delivered by the Supreme Lord through the different methods of\nfruitive activities, cultivation of knowledge, and the discharge of devotional\nservice are explained. Although the living entity is completely different from\nthe material body, he somehow becomes related. This also is explained.",

TRANSLATION  O scion of Bharata, you should understand that I am also the knower in all\nbodies, and to understand this body and its owner is called knowledge. That is\nMy opinion.  PURPORT  While discussing the subject of this body and the owner of the body, the soul\nand the Supersoul, we shall find three different topics of study: the Lord, the\n1iving entity, and matter. In every field of activities, in every body, there\nare two souls: the individual soul and the Supersoul. Because the Supersoul is\nthe plenary expansion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says,\n\u201cI am also the knower, but I am not the individual owner of the body. I am the\nsuperknower. I am present in every body as the Param\u0101tm\u0101, or Supersoul.\u201d  One who studies the subject matter of the field of activity and the knower of\nthe field very minutely, in terms of this Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, can attain to\nknowledge.  The Lord says: \u201cI am the knower of the field of activities in every individual\nbody.\u201d The individual may be the knower of his own body, but he is not in\nknowledge of other bodies. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is present as\nthe Supersoul in all bodies, knows everything about all bodies. He knows all the\ndifferent bodies of all the various species of life. A citizen may know\neverything about his patch of land, but the king knows not only his palace but\nall the properties possessed by the individual citizens. Similarly, one may be\nthe proprietor of the body individually, but the Supreme Lord is the proprietor\nof all bodies. The king is the original proprietor of the kingdom, and the\ncitizen is the secondary proprietor. Similarly, the Supreme Lord is the supreme\nproprietor of all bodies.  The body consists of the senses. The Supreme Lord is H\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba, which means\ncontroller of the senses. He is the original controller of the senses, just as\nthe king is the original controller of all the activities of the state, and the\ncitizens are secondary controllers. The Lord also says: \u201cI am also the knower.\u201d\nThis means that He is the superknower; the individual soul knows only his\nparticular body. In the Vedic literature, it is stated as follows:  k\u1e63etr\u0101\u1e47i hi \u015bar\u012br\u0101\u1e47i b\u012bja\u1e41 c\u0101pi \u015bubh\u0101\u015bubhe t\u0101ni vetti sa yog\u0101tm\u0101 tata\u1e25 k\u1e63etraj\u00f1a\nucyate.  This body is called the k\u1e63etra, and within it dwells the owner of the body and\nthe Supreme Lord who knows both the body and the owner of the body. Therefore He\nis called the knower of all fields. The distinction between the field of\nactivities, the owner of activities and the supreme owner of activities is\ndescribed as follows. Perfect knowledge of the constitution of the body, the\nconstitution of the individual soul, and the constitution of the Supersoul is\nknown in terms of Vedic literature as j\u00f1\u0101nam. That is the opinion of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. To\nunderstand both the soul and the Supersoul as one yet distinct is knowledge. One\nwho does not understand the field of activity and the knower of activity is not\nin perfect knowledge. One has to understand the position of prak\u1e5bti, nature, and\npuru\u1e63a, the enjoyer of the nature, and \u012b\u015bvara, the knower who dominates or\ncontrols nature and the individual soul. One should not confuse the three in\ntheir different capacities. One should not confuse the painter, the painting and\nthe easel. This material world, which is the field of activities, is nature, and\nthe enjoyer of nature is the living entity, and above them both is the supreme\ncontroller, the Personality of Godhead. It is stated in the Vedic language:\n\u201cbhokt\u0101 bhogya\u1e41 prerit\u0101ra\u1e41 ca matv\u0101 sarva\u1e41 prokta\u1e41 tri-vidha\u1e41 brahmam etat.\u201d\nThere are three Brahman conceptions: prak\u1e5bti is Brahman as the field of\nactivities, and the j\u012bva (individual soul) is also Brahman and is trying to\ncontrol material nature, and the controller of both of them is also Brahman, but\nHe is the factual controller.  In this chapter it will be also explained that out of the two knowers, one is\nfallible and the other is infallible. One is superior and the other is\nsubordinate. One who understands the two knowers of the field to be one and the\nsame contradicts the Supreme Personality of Godhead who states here very clearly\nthat \u201cI am also the knower of the field of activity.\u201d One who misunderstands a\nrope to be a serpent is not in knowledge. There are different kinds of bodies,\nand there are different owners of the bodies. Because each individual soul has\nhis individual capacity of lording it over material nature, there are different\nbodies. But the Supreme also is present in them as the controller. The word ca\nis significant, for it indicates the total number of bodies. That is the opinion\nof \u015ar\u012bla Baladeva Vidy\u0101bh\u016b\u1e63a\u1e47a: K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supersoul present in each and every\nbody apart from the individual soul. And K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a explicitly says here that the\nSupersoul is the controller of both the field of activities and the finite\nenjoyer.",

TRANSLATION  Now please hear My brief description of this field of activity and how it is\nconstituted, what its changes are, whence it is produced, who that knower of the\nfield of activities is, and what his influences are.  PURPORT  The Lord is describing the field of activities and the knower of the field of\nactivities in their constitutional positions. One has to know how this body is\nconstituted, the materials of which this body is made, under whose control this\nbody is working, how the changes are taking place, wherefrom the changes are\ncoming, what the causes are, what the reasons are, what the ultimate goal of the\nindividual is, and what the actual form of the individual soul is. One should\nalso know the distinction between the individual living soul and the Supersoul,\nthe different influences, their potentials, etc. One just has to understand this\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 directly from the description given by the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead, and all this will be clarified. But one should be careful not to\nconsider the Supreme Personality of Godhead in every body and individual soul to\nbe the j\u012bva. This is something like equalizing the potent and the impotent.",

TRANSLATION  That knowledge of the field of activities and of the knower of activities is\ndescribed by various sages in various Vedic writings\u2014especially in the\nVed\u0101nta-s\u016btra\u2014and is presented with all reasoning as to cause and effect.  PURPORT  The Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is the highest authority in\nexplaining this knowledge. Still, as a matter of course, learned scholars and\nstandard authorities always give evidence from previous authorities. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is\nexplaining this most controversial point regarding the duality and non-duality\nof the soul and the Supersoul by referring to Scriptures, the Ved\u0101nta, which are\naccepted as authority. First, He says, this is according to different sages. As\nfar as the sages are concerned, besides Himself, Vy\u0101sadeva, the author of the\nVed\u0101nta-s\u016btra, is a great sage, and in the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra duality is perfectly\nexplained. And Vy\u0101sadeva\u2019s father, Par\u0101\u015bara, was also a great sage, and he\nwrites in his books of religiosity: \u201caham tva\u1e41 ca ath\u0101nye\u2026\u201d \u201cWe\u2014you, I and\nvarious other living entities\u2014are all transcendental, although in material\nbodies. Now we are fallen into the ways of the three modes of material nature\naccording to our different karma. As such, some are on higher levels, and some\nare in the lower nature. The higher and lower natures exist due to ignorance and\nare being manifested in an infinite number of living entities. But the\nSupersoul, which is infallible, is uncontaminated by the three qualities of\nnature and is transcendental.\u201d Similarly, in the original Vedas, a distinction\nbetween the soul, the Supersoul and the body is made, especially in the Ka\u1e6dha\nUpani\u1e63ad.  There is a manifestation of the Supreme Lord\u2019s energy known as annamaya by which\none depends simply upon food for existence. This is a materialistic realization\nof the Supreme. Then there is pr\u0101\u1e47amaya; this means that after realizing the\nSupreme Absolute Truth in foodstuff, one can realize the Absolute Truth in the\nliving symptoms, or life forms. In j\u00f1\u0101namaya the living symptom develops to the\npoint of thinking, feeling, and willing. Then there is Brahman realization and\nthe realization called vij\u00f1\u0101namaya by which the living entity\u2019s mind and life\nsymptoms are distinguished from the living entity himself. The next and supreme\nstage is \u0101nandamaya, realization of the all-blissful nature. Thus there are five\nstages of Brahman realization, which is called brahma puccham. Out of these the\nfirst three\u2014annamaya, pr\u0101\u1e47amaya, and j\u00f1\u0101namaya\u2014involve the fields of activities\nof the living entities. Transcendental to all these fields of activities is the\nSupreme Lord, who is called \u0101nandamaya. In the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra also the Supreme is\ncalled \u0101nandamayo \u2019bhy\u0101s\u0101t. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is by nature full\nof joy, and to enjoy His transcendental bliss, He expands into vij\u00f1\u0101namaya,\npr\u0101\u1e47amaya, j\u00f1\u0101namaya, and annamaya. In this field of activities the living\nentity is considered to be the enjoyer, and different from him is the\n\u0101nandamaya. That means that if the living entity decides to enjoy, in\ndovetailing himself with the \u0101nandamaya, then he becomes perfect. This is the\nreal picture of the Supreme Lord, as supreme knower of the field, the living\nentity, as subordinate knower, and the nature of the field of activities.",

TRANSLATION  The five great elements, false ego, intelligence, the unmanifested, the ten\nsenses, the mind, the five sense objects, desire, hatred, happiness, distress,\nthe aggregate, the life symptoms, and convictions\u2014all these are considered, in\nsummary, to be the field of activities and its interactions.  PURPORT  From all the authoritative statements of the great sages, the Vedic hymns and\nthe aphorisms of the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra, the components of this world are earth,\nwater, fire, air and ether. These are the five great elements (mah\u0101bh\u016bta). Then\nthere are false ego, intelligence and the unmanifested stage of the three modes\nof nature. Then there are five senses for acquiring knowledge: the eyes, ears,\nnose, tongue and touch. Then five working senses: voice, legs, hands, the anus\nand the genitals. Then, above the senses, there is the mind, which is within and\nwhich can be called the sense within. Therefore, including the mind, there are\neleven senses altogether. Then there are the five objects of the senses: smell,\ntaste, warmth, touch and sound. Now the aggregate of these twenty-four elements\nis called the field of activity. If one makes an analytical study of these\ntwenty-four subjects, then he can very well understand the field of activity.\nThen there is desire, hatred, pleasure and pain, which are interactions,\nrepresentations of the five great elements in the gross body. The living\nsymptoms, represented by consciousness and conviction, are the manifestation of\nthe subtle body\u2014mind, ego and intelligence. These subtle elements are included\nwithin the field of activities.  The five great elements are a gross representation of the subtle false ego. They\nare a representation in the material conception. Consciousness is represented by\nintelligence, of which the unmanifested stage is the three modes of material\nnature. The unmanifested three modes of material nature is called pradh\u0101na.  One who desires to know the twenty-four elements in detail along with their\ninteractions should study the philosophy in more detail. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, a\nsummary only is given.  The body is the representation of all these factors, and there are changes of\nthe body, which are six in number: the body is born, it grows, it stays, it\nproduces by-products, then begins to decay, and at the last stage it vanishes.\nTherefore the field is a nonpermanent material thing. However, the k\u1e63etraj\u00f1a,\nthe knower of the field, its proprietor, is different.",

TRANSLATION  Humility, pridelessness, nonviolence, tolerance, simplicity, approaching a bona\nfide spiritual master, cleanliness, steadiness and self-control; renunciation of\nthe objects of sense gratification, absence of false ego, the perception of the\nevil of birth, death, old age and disease; nonattachment to children, wife, home\nand the rest, and evenmindedness amid pleasant and unpleasant events; constant\nand unalloyed devotion to Me, resorting to solitary places, detachment from the\ngeneral mass of people; accepting the importance of self-realization, and\nphilosophical search for the Absolute Truth\u2014all these I thus declare to be\nknowledge, and what is contrary to these is ignorance.  PURPORT  This process of knowledge is sometimes misunderstood by less intelligent men as\nbeing the interaction of the field of activity. But actually this is the real\nprocess of knowledge. If one accepts this process, then the possibility of\napproaching the Absolute Truth exists. This is not the interaction of the\ntenfold elements, as described before, This is actually the means to get out of\nit. Of all the descriptions of the process of knowledge, the most important\npoint is described in the first line of the tenth verse: The process of\nknowledge terminates in unalloyed devotional service to the Lord. So, if one\ndoes not approach, or is not able to approach, the transcendental service of the\nLord, then the other nineteen items are of no particular value. But, if one\ntakes to devotional service in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, the other nineteen\nitems automatically develop within him. The principle of accepting a spiritual\nmaster, as mentioned in the seventh verse, is essential. Even for one who takes\nto devotional service, it is most important. Transcendental life begins when one\naccepts a bona fide spiritual master. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, \u015ar\u012b\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, clearly states here that this process of knowledge is the actual path.\nAnything speculated beyond this is nonsense.  As for the knowledge outlined here, the items may be analyzed as follows:\nHumility means that one should not be anxious to have the satisfaction of being\nhonored by others. The material conception of life makes us very eager to\nreceive honor from others, but from the point of view of a man in perfect\nknowledge\u2014who knows that he is not this body\u2014anything, honor or dishonor,\npertaining to this body is useless. One should not be hankering after this\nmaterial deception. People are very anxious to be famous for their religion, and\nconsequently sometimes it is found that without understanding the principles of\nreligion, one enters into some group, which is not actually following religious\nprinciples, and then wants to advertise himself as a religious mentor. As for\nactual advancement in spiritual science, one should have a test to see how far\nhe is progressing. He can judge by these items.  Nonviolence is generally taken to mean not killing or destroying the body, but\nactually nonviolence means not to put others into distress. People in general\nare trapped by ignorance in the material concept of life, and they perpetually\nsuffer material pains. So, unless one elevates people to spiritual knowledge,\none is practicing violence. One should try his best to distribute real knowledge\nto the people, so that they may become enlightened and leave this material\nentanglement. That is nonviolence.  Tolerance means that one should be practiced to bear insult and dishonor from\nothers. If one is engaged in the advancement of spiritual knowledge, there will\nbe so many insults and much dishonor from others. This is expected because\nmaterial nature is so constituted. Even a boy like Prahl\u0101da, who, only five\nyears old, was engaged in the cultivation of spiritual knowledge, was endangered\nwhen his father became antagonistic to his devotion. The father tried to kill\nhim in so many ways, but Prahlada tolerated him. So, for making advancement in\nspiritual knowledge, there may be many impediments, but we should be tolerant\nand continue our progress with determination.  Simplicity means that without diplomacy one should be so straightforward that he\ncan disclose the real truth even to an enemy. As for acceptance of the spiritual\nmaster, that is essential, because without the instruction of a bona fide\nspiritual master, one cannot progress in the spiritual science. One should\napproach the spiritual master with all humility and offer him all services so\nthat he will be pleased to bestow his blessings upon the disciple. Because a\nbona fide spiritual master is a representative of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, if he bestows any\nblessings upon his disciple, that will make the disciple immediately advanced\nwithout the disciple\u2019s following the regulated principles. Or, the regulated\nprinciples will be easier for one who has served the spiritual master without\nreservation.  Cleanliness is essential for making advancement in spiritual life. There are two\nkinds of cleanliness: external and internal. External cleanliness means taking a\nbath, but for internal cleanliness, one has to think of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a always and chant\nHare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/Hare R\u0101ma. Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma\nHare Hare. This process cleans the accumulated dust of past karma from the mind.  Steadiness means that one should be very determined to make progress in\nspiritual life. Without such determination, one cannot make tangible progress.\nAnd self-control means that one should not accept anything which is detrimental\nto the path of spiritual progress. One should become accustomed to this and\nreject anything which is against the path of spiritual progress. This is real\nrenunciation. The senses are so strong that they are always anxious to have\nsense gratification. One should not cater to these demands, which are not\nnecessary. The senses should only be gratified to keep the body fit so that one\ncan discharge his duty in advancing in spiritual life. The most important and\nuncontrollable sense is the tongue. If one can control the tongue, then there is\nevery possibility of controlling the other senses. The function of the tongue is\nto taste and to vibrate. Therefore, by systematic regulation, the tongue should\nalways be engaged in tasting the remnants of foodstuffs offered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and\nchanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. As far as the eyes are concerned, they should not be\nallowed to see anything but the beautiful form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. That will control the\neyes. Similarly, the ears should be engaged in hearing about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and the nose\nin smelling the flowers offered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This is the process of devotional\nservice, and it is understood here that Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is simply expounding the\nscience of devotional service. Devotional service is the main and sole\nobjective. Unintelligent commentators on the G\u012bt\u0101 try to divert the mind of the\nreader to other subjects, but there is no other subject in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 but\ndevotional service.  False ego means accepting this body as oneself. When one understands that he is\nnot his body and is spirit soul, that is real ego. Ego is there. False ego is\ncondemned, but not real ego. In the Vedic literature, it is said: aha\u1e41\nbrahm\u0101smi. I am Brahman, I am spirit. This \u201cI am,\u201d the sense of self, also\nexists in the liberated stage of self-realization. This sense of \u201cI am\u201d is ego,\nbut when the sense of \u201cI am\u201d is applied to this false body, it is false ego.\nWhen the sense of self is applied to reality, that is real ego. There are some\nphilosophers who say we should give up our ego, but we cannot give up our ego\nbecause ego means identity. We ought, of course, to give up the false\nidentification with the body.  One should try to understand the distress of accepting birth, death, old age and\ndisease. There are descriptions in various Vedic literatures of birth. In the\n\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam the world of the unborn, the child\u2019s stay in the womb of the\nmother, its suffering, etc., are all very graphically described. It should be\nthoroughly understood that birth is distressful. Because we forget how much\ndistress we have suffered within the womb of the mother, we do not make any\nsolution to the repetition of birth and death. Similarly at the time of death,\nthere are all kinds of sufferings, and they are also mentioned in the\nauthoritative scriptures. These should be discussed. And as far as disease and\nold age are concerned, everyone gets practical experience. No one wants to be\ndiseased, and no one wants to become old, but there is no avoiding these. Unless\nwe have a pessimistic view of this material life, considering the distresses of\nbirth, death, old age and disease, there is no impetus for our making\nadvancement in spiritual life.  As for detachment from children, wife and home, it is not meant that one should\nhave no feeling for these. They are natural objects of affection, but when they\nare not favorable to spiritual progress, then one should not be attached to\nthem. The best process for making the home pleasant is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. If\none is in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, he can make his home very happy because this\nprocess of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is very easy. One need only chant Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a,\nHare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare,\naccept the remnants of foodstuffs offered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, have some discussion on\nbooks like Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, and engage oneself in Deity\nworship. These four will make one happy. One should train the members of his\nfamily in this way. The family members can sit down morning and evening and\nchant together Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/Hare R\u0101ma, Hare\nR\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare. If one can mold his family life in this way to\ndevelop K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, following these four principles, then there is no\nneed to change from family life to renounced life. But if it is not congenial,\nnot favorable for spiritual advancement, then family life should be abandoned.\nOne must sacrifice everything to realize or serve K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, just as Arjuna did.\nArjuna did not want to kill his family members, but when he understood that\nthese family members were impediments to his K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a realization, he accepted the\ninstruction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and fought and killed them. In all cases, one should be\ndetached from the happiness and distress of family life because in this world\none can never be fully happy or fully miserable. Happiness and distress are\nconcommitant factors of material life. One should learn to tolerate, as advised\nin Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. One can never restrict the coming and going of happiness and\ndistress, so one should be detached from the materialistic way of life and be\nautomatically equiposed in both cases. Generally, when we get something\ndesirable, we are very happy, and when we get something undesirable, we are\ndistressed. But if we are actually in the spiritual position, these things will\nnot agitate us. To reach that stage, we have to practice unbreakable devotional\nservice; devotional service to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a without deviation means engaging oneself in\nthe nine processes of devotional service, chanting, hearing, worshiping,\noffering respect, etc., as described in the last verse of the Ninth Chapter.\nThat process should be followed. Naturally, when one is adapted to the spiritual\nway of life, he will not want to mix with materialistic men. That would go\nagainst his grain. One may test himself by seeing how far he is inclined to live\nin a solitary place without unwanted association.  Naturally a devotee has no taste for unnecessary sporting or cinema-going or\nenjoying some social function, because he understands that these are simply a\nwaste of time. There are many research scholars and philosophers who study sex\nlife or some other subject, but according to Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, such research work\nand philosophical speculation have no value. That is more or less nonsensical.\nAccording to Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, one should make research by philosophical discretion\ninto the nature of the soul. One should make research to understand with what\nthe self is concerned. That is recommended here.  As far as self-realization is concerned, it is clearly stated here that\nbhakti-yoga is especially practical. As soon as there is a question of devotion,\none must consider the relationship between the Supersoul and the individual\nsoul. The individual soul and the Supersoul cannot be one, at least not in the\nbhakti conception, the devotional conception of life. This service of the\nindividual soul to the Supreme Soul is eternal, nityam, as is clearly stated. So\nbhakti or devotional service is eternal. One should be established in that\nphilosophical conviction, otherwise it is only a waste of time, ignorance.  In the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, this is explained; vadanti tat tattva-vidas tattva\u1e41\nyaj j\u00f1\u0101nam advayam. \u201cThose who are actually knowers of the Absolute Truth know\nthat the Self is realized in three different phases as Brahman, Param\u0101tm\u0101 and\nBhagav\u0101n.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 1.2.11) Bhagav\u0101n is the last word in the realization of the\nAbsolute Truth; therefore one should reach up to that platform of understanding\nthe Supreme Personality of Godhead and thus engage in the devotional service of\nthe Lord. That is perfection of knowledge.  Beginning from practicing humility up to the point of realization of the Supreme\nTruth, the Absolute Personality of Godhead, this process is just like a\nstaircase beginning from the ground floor up to the top floor. Now on this\nstaircase there are so many people who have reached the first floor, the second\nor third floor, etc., but unless one reaches the top floor, which is the\nunderstanding of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he is at a lower stage of knowledge. If anyone wants to\ncompete with God and at the same time make advancement in spiritual knowledge,\nhe will be frustrated. It is clearly stated that without humility understanding\nis harmful. To think oneself God is most puffed up. Although the living entity\nis always being kicked by the stringent laws of material nature, still he\nthinks, \u201cI am God\u201d because of ignorance. One should be humble and know that he\nis subordinate to the Supreme Lord. Due to rebellion against the Supreme Lord,\none becomes subordinate to material nature. One must know and be convinced of\nthis truth.",

TRANSLATION  I shall now explain the knowable, knowing which you will taste the eternal. This\nis beginningless, and it is subordinate to Me. It is called Brahman, the spirit,\nand it lies beyond the cause and effect of this material world.  PURPORT  The Lord has explained the field of activities and the knower of the field. He\nhas also explained the process of knowing the knower of the field of activities.\nNow He is explaining the knowable, both the soul and the Supersoul respectively.\nBy knowledge of the knower, both the soul and the Supersoul, one can relish the\nnectar of life. As explained in the Second Chapter, the living entity is\neternal. This is also confirmed here. There is no specific date at which the\nj\u012bva was born. Nor can anyone trace out the history of j\u012bv\u0101tm\u0101\u2019s manifestation\nfrom the Supreme Lord. Therefore it is beginningless. The Vedic literature\nconfirms this: na j\u0101yate m\u1e5bjayate v\u0101 vipa\u015bcit. The knower of the body is never\nborn and never dies, and he is full of knowledge. The Supreme Lord is also\nstated in the Vedic literature as pradh\u0101na-k\u1e63etraj\u00f1a-patir gu\u1e47e\u015ba\u1e25. The Supreme\nLord as the Supersoul is the chief knower of the body, and He is the master of\nthe three modes of material nature. In the sm\u1e5bti it is said: d\u0101sa-bh\u016bto harer\neva n\u0101nyasvaiva kad\u0101cana. The living entities are eternally in the service of\nthe Supreme Lord. This is also confirmed by Lord Caitanya in His teaching;\ntherefore the description of Brahman mentioned in this verse is in relation to\nthe individual soul, and when the word Brahman is applied to the living entity,\nit is to be understood that he is vij\u00f1\u0101na\u1e41 brahma as opposed to ananta-brahma.\nAnanta-brahma is the Supreme Brahman Personality of Godhead.",

TRANSLATION  Everywhere are His hands and legs, His eyes and faces, and He hears everything.\nIn this way the Supersoul exists.  PURPORT  As the sun exists diffusing its unlimited rays, so does the Supersoul, or\nSupreme Personality of Godhead. He exists in His all-pervading form, and in Him\nexist all the individual living entities, beginning from the first great\nteacher, Brahm\u0101, down to the small ants. There are unlimited heads, legs, hands\nand eyes, and unlimited living entities. All are existing in and on the\nSupersoul. Therefore the Supersoul is all-pervading. The individual soul,\nhowever, cannot say that he has his hands, legs and eyes everywhere. That is not\npossible. If he thinks that although under ignorance he is not conscious that\nhis hands and legs are diffused all over, but when he attains to proper\nknowledge he will come to that stage, his thinking is contradictory. This means\nthat the individual soul, having become conditioned by material nature, is not\nsupreme. The Supreme is different from the individual soul. The Supreme Lord can\nextend His hand without limit; the individual soul cannot. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 the\nLord says that if anyone offers Him a flower, or a fruit, or a little water, He\naccepts. If the Lord is a far distance away, how can He accept things? This is\nthe omnipotence of the Lord: even though He is situated in His own abode, far,\nfar away from earth, He can extend His hand to accept what anyone offers. That\nis His potency. In the Brahm\u0101-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 it is stated, goloka eva nivasati:\nalthough He is always engaged in pastimes in His transcendental planet, He is\nall-pervading. The individual soul cannot claim that he is all-pervading.\nTherefore this verse describes the Supreme Soul, the Personality of Godhead, not\nthe individual soul.",

TRANSLATION  The Supersoul is the original source of all senses, yet He is without senses. He\nis unattached, although He is the maintainer of all living beings. He transcends\nthe modes of nature, and at the same time He is the master of all modes of\nmaterial nature.  PURPORT  The Supreme Lord, although the source of all the senses of the living entities,\ndoesn\u2019t have material senses like they have. Actually, the individual souls have\nspiritual senses, but in condemned life they are covered with the material\nelements and therefore the sense activities are exhibited through matter. The\nSupreme Lord\u2019s senses are not so covered. His senses are transcendental and are\ntherefore called nirgu\u1e47a. Gu\u1e47a means the material modes, but His senses are\nwithout material covering. It should be understood that His senses are not\nexactly like ours. Although He is the source of all our sensual activities, He\nhas His transcendental senses which are uncontaminated. This is very nicely\nexplained in the \u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad in the verse: sarvata\u1e25 p\u0101\u1e47i-p\u0101dam. The\nSupreme Personality of Godhead has no hands which are materially contaminated,\nbut He has His hands and accepts whatever sacrifice is offered to Him. That is\nthe distinction between the conditioned soul and the Supersoul. He has no\nmaterial eyes, but He has eyes\u2014otherwise how could He see? He sees everything,\npast, present and future. He lives within the heart of the living being, and He\nknows what we have done in the past, what we are doing now, and what is awaiting\nus in the future. This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101: He knows everything,\nbut no one knows Him. It is said that the Supreme Lord has no legs like us, but\nHe can travel throughout space because He has spiritual legs. In other words,\nthe Lord is not impersonal; He has His eyes, legs, hands and everything else,\nand because we are part and parcel of the Supreme Lord we also have these\nthings. But His hands, legs, eyes and senses are not contaminated by material\nnature.  Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 also confirms that when the Lord appears He appears as He is by\nHis internal potency. He is not contaminated by the material energy because He\nis the Lord of material energy. In the Vedic literature we find that His whole\nembodiment is spiritual. He has His eternal form called sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha.\nHe is full of all opulence. He is the proprietor of all wealth and the owner of\nall energy. He is the most intelligent and is full of knowledge. These are some\nof the symptoms of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is maintainer of all\nliving entities and the witness of all activities. As far as we can understand\nfrom Vedic literature, the Supreme Lord is always transcendental. Although we do\nnot see His head, face, hands, or legs, He has them, and when we are elevated to\nthe transcendental situation then we can see the Lord\u2019s form. Due to materially\ncontaminated senses, we cannot see His form. Therefore the impersonalists who\nare still materially affected cannot understand the Personality of Godhead.",

He is beyond the power of the material senses to see or to know.\nAlthough far, far away, He is also near to all.  PURPORT  In Vedic literature we understand that N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, the Supreme Person, is residing\nboth outside and inside of every living entity. He is present both in the\nspiritual and material world. Although He is far, far away, still He is near to\nus.

But one who\nhas purified his mind and senses by practicing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness in devotional\nservice can see Him constantly. It is confirmed in Brahm\u0101-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 that the\ndevotee who has developed love for the Supreme God can see Him always, without\ncessation. And it is confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (11.54) that He can be seen and\nunderstood only by devotional service. Bhakty\u0101 tvananyay\u0101 \u015bakya\u1e25.",

TRANSLATION  Although the Supersoul appears to be divided, He is never divided. He is\nsituated as one. Although He is the maintainer of every living entity, it is to\nbe understood that He devours and develops all.  PURPORT  The Lord is situated in everyone\u2019s heart as the Supersoul. Does that mean that\nHe has become divided? No. Actually, He is one. The example is given of the sun:\nthe sun, at the meridian, is situated in his place. But if one goes for five\nthousand miles in all directions and asks, \u201cWhere is the sun?\u201d everyone will say\nthat it is shining on his head. In the Vedic literature this example is given to\nshow that although He is undivided, He is situated as if divided. Also it is\nsaid in Vedic literature that one Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is present everywhere by His\nomnipotence, just as the sun appears in many places to many persons. And the\nSupreme Lord, although the maintainer of every living entity, devours everything\nat the time of annihilation. This was confirmed in the Eleventh Chapter when the\nLord said that He has come to devour all the warriors assembled at Kuruk\u1e63etra.\nHe also mentions that in the form of time He devours also. He is the\nannihilator, the killer of all. When there is creation, He develops all from\ntheir original state, and at the time of annihilation He devours them. The Vedic\nhymns confirm the fact that He is the origin of all living entities and the rest\nof al1. After creation, everything rests in His omnipotence, and after\nannihilation, everything again returns to rest in Him. These are the\nconfirmations of Vedic hymns.

He is knowledge, He is the object of knowledge, and\nHe is the goal of knowledge. He is situated in everyone\u2019s heart.  PURPORT  The Supersoul, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the source of light in all\nluminous objects like the sun, moon, stars, etc. In the Vedic literature we find\nthat in the spiritual kingdom there is no need of sun or moon because the\neffulgence of the Supreme Lord is there. In the material world that brahmajyoti\nthe Lord\u2019s spiritual effulgence, is covered by the mahat-tattva, the material\nelements; therefore in this material world we require the assistance of sun,\nmoon, electricity, etc., for light. But in the spiritual world there is no need\nof such things. It is clearly stated in the Vedic literature that because of His\nluminous effulgence, everything is illuminated. It is clear, therefore, that His\nsituation is not in the material world. He is situated in the spiritual world\nwhich is far, far away in the spiritual sky. That is also confirmed in the Vedic\nliterature. \u0100ditya-var\u1e47am tamasa\u1e25 parast\u0101t. He is just like the sun, eternally\nluminous, but He is far, far beyond the darkness of this material world. His\nknowledge is transcendental. The Vedic literature confirms that Brahman is\nconcentrated transcendental knowledge. To one who is anxious to be transferred\nto that spiritual world, knowledge is given by the Supreme Lord who is situated\nin everyone\u2019s heart.  One Vedic mantra says: ta\u1e41 ha devam \u0101tma-buddhi-prak\u0101\u015ba\u1e41 mumuk\u1e63ur vai \u015bara\u1e47am\naham prapadye. One must surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead if he\nat all wants liberation. As far as the goal of ultimate knowledge is concerned,\nit is also confirmed in Vedic literature: tam eva viditv\u0101tim\u1e5btyum eti. \u201cOnly by\nknowing You can one surpass the boundary of birth and death.\u201d He is situated in\neveryone\u2019s heart as the supreme controller. The Supreme has legs and hands\ndistributed everywhere, and this cannot be said of the individual soul.\nTherefore that there are two knowers of the field of activity, the individual\nsoul and the Supersoul, must be admitted. One\u2019s hands and legs are distributed\nlocally, but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s hands and legs are distributed everywhere. This is\nconfirmed in the \u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad: sarvasya prabhum \u012b\u015b\u0101na\u1e41 sarvasya \u015bara\u1e47a\u1e41\nb\u1e5bhat. That Supreme Personality of Godhead, Supersoul, is the prabhu or master\nof all living entities; therefore He is the ultimate center of all living\nentities. So there is no denying the fact that the Supreme Supersoul and the\nindividual soul are always different.",

TRANSLATION  Material nature and the living entities should be understood to be\nbeginningless. Their transformations and the modes of matter are products of\nmaterial nature.  PURPORT  By this knowledge, the body, the field of activities and the knowers of the body\n(both the individual soul and the Supersoul) can be known. The body is the field\nof activity and is composed of material nature. It is the individual soul which\nis embodied. Enjoying the activities of the body is the puru\u1e63a, or the living\nentity. He is one knower, and the other is the Supersoul. Of course, it is to be\nunderstood that both the Supersoul and the individual entity are different\nmanifestations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The living entity is in\nthe category of His energy, and the Supersoul is in the category of His personal\nexpansion.  Both material nature and the living entity are eternal. That is to say that they\nexisted before the creation. The material manifestation is from the energy of\nthe Supreme Lord and so also are the living entities, but they are of the\nsuperior energy. Both of them existed before this cosmos was manifested.\nMaterial nature was absorbed in the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Mah\u0101-Vis\u1e47u,\nand when it was required, it was manifested by the agency of mahat-tattva.\nSimilarly, the living entities are also in Him, and because they are\nconditioned, they are adverse to serving the Supreme Lord. Thus they are not\nallowed to enter into the spiritual sky. After the winding up of material\nnature, these living entities are again given a chance to act in the material\nworld and prepare themselves to enter into the spiritual world. That is the\nmystery of this material creation. Actually the living entity is originally the\nspiritual part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, but due to his rebellious nature,\nhe is conditioned within material nature. It really does not matter how these\nliving entities or superior entities of the Supreme Lord have come in contact\nwith material nature. The Supreme Personality of Godhead knows, however, how and\nwhy this actually took place. In the scriptures the Lord says that those\nattracted by this material nature are undergoing a hard struggle for existence.\nBut we should know it with certainty from the descriptions of these few verses\nthat all the transformations and influences of material nature by the three\nmodes are also productions of material nature. All transformations and variety\nin respect to living entities are due to the body. As far as spirit is\nconcerned, living entities are all the same.",

PURPORT  The different manifestations of body and senses among the living entities are\ndue to material nature. There are 8,400,000 different species of life, and these\nvarieties are the creation of the material nature. They arise from the different\nsensual pleasures of the 1iving entity, who thus desires to live in this body or\nthat. When he is put into different bodies, he enjoys different kinds of\nhappiness and distress. His material happiness and distress are due to his body,\nand not to himself as he is. In his original state there is no doubt of\nenjoyment; therefore that is his real state. Because of the desire to lord it\nover material nature, he is in the material world. In the spiritual world there\nis no such thing. The spiritual world is pure, but in the material world\neveryone is struggling hard to acquire victims who present different pleasures\nto the body. It might be more clear to state that this body is the effect of the\nsenses. The senses are instruments for gratifying desire. Now, the sum\ntotal\u2014body and instrument senses\u2014are offered by material nature, and, as will be\nclear in the next verse, the living entity is blessed or damned with\ncircumstances according to his past desire and activity. According to one\u2019s\ndesires and activities, material nature places one in various residential\nquarters. The being himself is the cause of his attaining such residential\nquarters and his attendant enjoyment or suffering. Once placed in some\nparticular kind of body, he comes under the control of nature because the body,\nbeing matter, acts according to the laws of nature. At that time, the 1iving\nentity has no power to change that law. Suppose an entity is put into the body\nof a dog. As soon as he is put into the body of a dog, he must act like a dog.\nHe cannot act otherwise. And if the living entity is put into the body of a hog,\nthen he is forced to eat stool and act like a hog. Similarly, if the living\nentity is put into the body of a demigod, he must act according to his body.\nThis is the law of nature. But in all circumstances, the Supersoul is with the\nindividual soul. That is explained in the Vedas as follows: dv\u0101 supar\u1e47\u0101 sayuj\u0101\nsakh\u0101y\u0101. The Supreme Lord is so kind upon the living entity that He always\naccompanies the individual soul and in all circumstances is present as the\nSupersoul or Param\u0101tm\u0101.",

TRANSLATION  The living entity in material nature thus follows the ways of life, enjoying the\nthree modes of nature. This is due to his association with that material nature.\nThus he meets with good and evil amongst various species.  PURPORT  This verse is very important for an understanding of how the living entities\ntransmigrate from one body to another. It is explained in the Second Chapter\nthat the living entity is transmigrating from one body to another just as one\nchanges dress. This change of dress is due to his attachment to material\nexistence. As long as he is captivated by this false manifestation, he has to\ncontinue transmigrating from one body to another. Due to his desire to lord it\nover material nature, he is put into such undesirable circumstances. Under the\ninfluence of material desire, the entity is born sometimes as a demigod,\nsometimes as a man, sometimes as a beast, as a bird, as a worm, as an aquatic,\nas a saintly man, as a bug. This is going on. And in all cases the living entity\nthinks himself to be the master of his circumstances, yet he is under the\ninfluence of material nature.  How he is put into such different bodies is explained here. It is due to\nassociation with the different modes of nature. One has to rise, therefore,\nabove the three material modes and become situated in the transcendental\nposition. That is called K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Unless one is situated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness, his material consciousness will oblige him to transfer from one\nbody to another because he has material desires since time immemorial. But he\nhas to change that conception. That change can be effected only by hearing from\nauthoritative sources. The best example is here: Arjuna is hearing the science\nof God from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The living entity, if he submits to this hearing process,\nwill lose his long-cherished desire to dominate material nature, and gradually\nand proportionately, as he reduces his long desire to dominate, he comes to\nenjoy spiritual happiness. In a Vedic mantra it is said that as he becomes\nlearned in association with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he\nproportionately relishes his eternal blissful life.",

TRANSLATION  Yet in this body there is another, a transcendental enjoyer who is the Lord, the\nsupreme proprietor, who exists as the overseer and permitter, and who is known\nas the Supersoul.  PURPORT  It is stated here that the Supersoul, who is always with the individual soul, is\nthe representation of the Supreme Lord. He is not an ordinary living entity.\nBecause the monist philosophers take the knower of the body to be one, they\nthink that there is no difference between the Supersoul and the individual soul.\nTo clarify this, the Lord says that He is the representation of Param\u0101tm\u0101 in\nevery body. He is different from the individual soul; He is para\u1e25,\ntranscendental. The individual soul enjoys the activities of a particular field,\nbut the Supersoul is present not as finite enjoyer nor as one taking part in\nbodily activities, but as the witness, overseer, permitter and supreme enjoyer.\nHis name is Param\u0101tm\u0101, not \u0101tm\u0101, and He is transcendental. It is distinctly\nclear that the \u0101tm\u0101 and Param\u0101tm\u0101 are different. The Supersoul, the Param\u0101tm\u0101,\nhas legs and hands everywhere, but the individual soul does not. And because He\nis the Supreme Lord, He is present within to sanction the individual soul\u2019s\ndesiring material enjoyment. Without the sanction of the Supreme Soul, the\nindividual soul cannot do anything. The individual is bhakta or the sustained,\nand He is bhukta or the maintainer. There are innumerable living entities, and\nHe is staying in them as a friend.  The fact is that individual living entities are eternally part and parcel of the\nSupreme Lord, and both of them are very intimately related as friends. But the\nliving entity has the tendency to reject the sanction of the Supreme Lord and\nact independantly in an attempt to dominate the supreme nature, and because he\nhas this tendency, he is called the marginal energy of the Supreme Lord. The\nliving entity can be situated either in the material energy or the spiritual\nenergy. As long as he is conditioned by the material energy, the Supreme Lord,\nas his friend, the Supersoul, stays with him just to get him to return to the\nspiritual energy. The Lord is always eager to take him back to the spiritual\nenergy, but due to his minute independence, the individual entity is continually\nrejecting the association of spiritual light. This misuse of independence is the\ncause of his material strife in the conditioned nature. The Lord, therefore, is\nalways giving instruction from within and from without. From without He gives\ninstructions as stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, and from within He tries to convince\nhim that his activities in the material field are not conducive to real\nhappiness. \u201cJust give it up and turn your faith toward Me. Then you will be\nhappy,\u201d He says. Thus the intelligent person who places his faith in the\nParam\u0101tm\u0101 or the Supreme Personality of Godhead begins to advance toward a\nblissful eternal life of knowledge",

TRANSLATION  That Supersoul is perceived by some through meditation, by some through the\ncultivation of knowledge, and by others through working without fruitive desire.  PURPORT  The Lord informs Arjuna that the conditioned soul can be divided into two\nclasses as far as man\u2019s search for self-realization is concerned. Those who are\natheists, agnostics and skeptics are beyond the sense of spiritual\nunderstanding. But there are others who are faithful in their understanding of\nspiritual life, and they are called workers who have renounced fruitive results.\nThose who always try to establish the doctrine of monism are also counted among\nthe atheists and agnostics. In other words, only the devotees of the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead are really capable of spiritual understanding because\nthey understand that beyond this material nature there is the spiritual world\nand the Supreme Personality of Godhead who is expanded as the Param\u0101tm\u0101, the\nSupersoul in everyone, the all-pervading Godhead. Of course there are those who\ntry to understand the Supreme Absolute Truth by cultivation of knowledge, and\nthey can be counted in the second class. The atheistic philosophers analyze this\nmaterial world into twenty-four elements, and they place the individual soul as\nthe twenty-fifth item. When they are able to understand the nature of the\nindividual soul to be transcendental to the material elements, they are able to\nunderstand also that above the individual soul there is the Supreme Personality\nof Godhead. He is the twenty-sixth element. Thus gradually they also come to the\nstandard of devotional service in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Those who work without\nfruitive results are also perfect in their attitude. They are given a chance to\nadvance to the platform of devotional service in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Here it is\nstated that there are some people who are pure in consciousness and who try to\nfind out the Supersoul by meditation, and when they discover the Supersoul\nwithin themselves, they become transcendentally situated. Similarly, there are\nothers who also try to understand the Supreme Soul by cultivation of knowledge,\nand there are others who cultivate the ha\u1e6dha-yoga system and who try to satisfy\nthe Supreme Personality of Godhead by childish activities.",

TRANSLATION  Again there are those who, although not conversant in spiritual knowledge, begin\nto worship the Supreme Person upon hearing about Him from others. Because of\ntheir tendency to hear from authorities, they also transcend the path of birth\nand death.  PURPORT  This verse is particularly applicable to modern society because in modern\nsociety there is practically no education in spiritual matters. Some of the\npeople may appear to be atheistic or agnostic or philosophical, but actually\nthere is no knowledge of philosophy. As for the common man, if he is a good\nsoul, then there is a chance for advancement by hearing. This hearing process is\nvery important. Lord Caitanya, who preached K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness in the modern\nworld, gave great stress to hearing because if the common man simply hears from\nauthoritative sources, he can progress, especially, according to Lord Caitanya,\nif he hears the transcendental vibration Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a,\nHare Hare/Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare. It is stated, therefore,\nthat all men should take advantage of hearing from realized souls and gradually\nbecome able to understand everything. The worship of the Supreme Lord will then\nundoubtedly take place. Lord Caitanya has said that in this age no one needs to\nchange his position, but one should give up the endeavor to understand the\nAbsolute Truth by speculative reasoning. One should learn to become the servant\nof those who are in knowledge of the Supreme Lord. If one is fortunate enough to\ntake shelter of a pure devotee, hear from him about self-realization and follow\nin his footsteps, he will be gradually elevated to the position of a pure\ndevotee. In this verse particularly the process of hearing is strongly\nrecommended, and this is very appropriate. Although the common man is often not\nas capable as so-called philosophers, faithful hearing from an authoritative\nperson will help one transcend this material existence and go back to Godhead,\nback to home.",

In the material conception of life, we find someone a\ndemigod, someone a human being, a dog, a cat, etc. This is material vision, not\nactual vision. This material differentiation is due to a material conception of\nlife. After the destruction of the material body, this spirit soul is one. The\nspirit soul, due to contact with material nature, gets different types of\nbodies.

PURPORT  There are various theories regarding consciousness. Here in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 the\nexample of the sun and the sunshine is given. As the sun is situated in one\nplace, but is illuminating the whole universe, so a small particle of spirit\nsoul, although situated in the heart of this body, is illuminating the whole\nbody by consciousness. Thus consciousness is the proof of the presence of the\nsoul, as sunshine or light is the proof of the presence of the sun.  When the soul is present in the body, there is consciousness all over the body,\nand as soon as the soul has passed from the body, there is no more\nconsciousness. This can be easily understood by any intelligent man. Therefore\nconsciousness is not a production of the combinations of matter. It is the\nsymptom of the living entity. The consciousness of the living entity, although\nqualitatively one with the supreme consciousness, is not supreme because the\nconsciousness of one particular body does not share that of another body. But\nthe Supersoul, which is situated in all bodies as the friend of the individual\nsoul, is conscious of all bodies.

A faithful person\nshould at first have some good association to hear of God and thus gradually\nbecome enlightened. If one accepts a spiritual master, he can learn to\ndistinguish between matter and spirit, and that becomes the steppingstone for\nfurther spiritual realization. A spiritual master teaches his students to get\nfree from the material concept of life by various instructions. For instance, in\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 we find K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a instructing Arjuna to free him from materialistic\nconsiderations.  One can understand that this body is matter; it can be analyzed with its\ntwenty-four elements. That is the gross manifestation. And the subtle\nmanifestation is the mind and psychological effects. And the symptoms of life\nare the interaction of these features. But over and above this, there is the\nsoul, and there is also the Supersoul. The soul and the Supersoul are two. This\nmaterial world is working by the conjunction of the soul and the twenty-four\nmaterial elements. One who can see the constitution of the whole material\nmanifestation as this combination of the soul and material elements and also can\nsee the situation of the Supreme Soul becomes eligible for transfer to the\nspiritual world. These things are meant for contemplation and for realization,\nand one should have a complete understanding of this chapter with the help of\nthe spiritual master.",

Now, the Lord\nHimself is further enlightening Arjuna. If one understands this chapter through\nthe process of philosophical speculation, he will come to an understanding of\ndevotional service. In the Thirteenth Chapter, it was clearly explained that by\nhumbly developing knowledge one may possibly be freed from material\nentanglement. It has also been explained that it is due to association with the\nmodes of nature that the living entity is entangled in this material world. Now,\nin this chapter, the Supreme Personality explains what those modes of nature\nare, how they act, how they bind and how they give liberation. The knowledge\nexplained in this chapter is proclaimed by the Supreme Lord to be superior to\nthe knowledge given so far in other chapters. By understanding this knowledge,\nvarious great sages attain perfection and transfer to the spiritual world. The\nLord now explains the same knowledge in a better way. This knowledge is far, far\nsuperior to all other processes of knowledge thus far explained, and knowing\nthis many attain perfection. Thus it is expected that one who understands this\nFourteenth Chapter will attain perfection.\n\n\n14.2\n\n\nida\u1e41 j\u00f1\u0101nam up\u0101\u015britya\n\n\nmama s\u0101dharmyam \u0101gat\u0101\u1e25\n\n\nsarge \u2019pi nopaj\u0101yante\n\n\npralaye na vyathanti ca\n\n\nidam\u2014this; j\u00f1\u0101nam\u2014knowledge; up\u0101\u015britya\u2014taking shelter of; mama\u2014My;\ns\u0101dharmyam\u2014nature; \u0101gat\u0101\u1e25\u2014attain; sarge api\u2014even in the creation; na\u2014never;\nupaj\u0101yante\u2014comes in; pralaye\u2014in the annihilation; na\u2014nor; vyathanti\u2014disturbed;\nca\u2014also.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nBy becoming fixed in this knowledge, one can attain to the transcendental\nnature, which is like My own nature. Thus established, one is not born at the\ntime of creation nor disturbed at the time of dissolution.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nAfter acquiring perfect transcendental knowledge, one acquires qualitative\nequality with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, becoming free from the\nrepetition of birth and death. One does not, however, lose his identity as an\nindividual soul. It is understood from Vedic literature that the liberated souls\nwho have reached the transcendental planets of the spiritual sky always look to\nthe lotus feet of the Supreme Lord, being engaged in His transcendental loving\nservice. So, even after liberation, the devotees do not lose their individual\nidentities.\n\n\nGenerally, in the material world, whatever knowledge we get is contaminated by\nthe three modes of material nature. But knowledge which is not contaminated by\nthe three modes of nature is called transcendental knowledge. As soon as one is\nsituated in that transcendental knowledge, he is on the same platform as that of\nthe Supreme Person. Those who have no knowledge of the spiritual sky hold that\nafter being freed from the material activities of the material form, this\nspiritual identity becomes formless, without any variegatedness. However, just\nas there is material variegatedness in this world, so, in the spiritual world,\nthere is also variegatedness. Those in ignorance of this think that spiritual\nexistence is opposed to material variety. But actually, in the spiritual sky,\none attains spiritual form. There are spiritual activities, and the spiritual\nsituation is called devotional life. That atmosphere is said to be\nuncontaminated, and there one is equal in quality with the Supreme Lord. To\nobtain such knowledge, one must develop all the spiritual qualities. One who\nthus develops the spiritual qualities is not affected either by the creation or\nthe destruction of the material world.\n\n\n14.3\n\n\nmama yonir mahad brahma\n\n\ntasmin garbha\u1e41 dadh\u0101my aham\n\n\nsambhava\u1e25 sarva-bh\u016bt\u0101n\u0101\u1e41\n\n\ntato bhavati bh\u0101rata\n\n\nmama\u2014My; yoni\u1e25\u2014source of birth; mahat\u2014the total material existence;\nbrahma\u2014supreme; tasmin\u2014in that; garbham\u2014pregnancy; dadh\u0101mi\u2014create; aham\u2014I;\nsambhava\u1e25\u2014possibility; sarva-bh\u016bt\u0101n\u0101m\u2014of all living entities; tata\u1e25\u2014thereafter;\nbhavati\u2014becomes; bh\u0101rata\u2014O son of Bharata.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThe total material substance, called Brahman, is the source of birth, and it is\nthat Brahman that I impregnate, making possible the births of all living beings,\nO son of Bharata.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThis is an explanation of the world: everything that takes place is due to the\ncombination of k\u1e63etra and k\u1e63etraj\u00f1a, the body and the spirit soul. This\ncombination of material nature and the living entity is made possible by the\nSupreme God Himself. The mahat-tattva is the total cause of the total cosmic\nmanifestation, and because in the total substance of the material cause there\nare three modes of nature, it is sometimes called Brahman. The Supreme\nPersonality impregnates that total substance, and thus innumerable universes\nbecome possible. This total material substance, the mahat-tattva, is described\nas Brahman in the Vedic literature: tasm\u0101d etad brahma n\u0101ma-r\u016bpam anna\u1e41 ca\nj\u0101yate. Into that Brahman the seeds of the living entities are impregnated by\nthe Supreme Person. The twenty-four elements, beginning from earth, water, fire\nand air, are all material energy, called Mah\u0101-brahman, or the great Brahman, the\nmaterial nature. As is explained in the Seventh Chapter, beyond this there is\nanother, superior nature\u2014the living entity. In material nature the superior\nnature is mixed by the will of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and\nthereafter all living entities are born of this material nature.\n\n\nThe scorpion lays its eggs in piles of rice, and sometimes it is said that the\nscorpion is born out of rice. But the rice is not the cause of the scorpion.\nActually, the eggs were laid by the mother. Similarly, material nature is not\nthe cause of the birth of the living entities. The seed is given by the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead, and they only seem to come out as products of material\nnature. Thus every living entity, according to his past activities, has a\ndifferent body, created by this material nature, and the entity can enjoy or\nsuffer according to his past deeds. The Lord is the cause of all the\nmanifestations of living entities in this material world.\n\n\n14.4\n\n\nsarva-yoni\u1e63u kaunteya\n\n\nm\u016brtaya\u1e25 sambhavanti y\u0101\u1e25\n\n\nt\u0101s\u0101\u1e41 brahma mahad yonir\n\n\naha\u1e41 b\u012bja-prada\u1e25 pit\u0101\n\n\nsarva-yoni\u1e63u\u2014in all species of life; kaunteya\u2014O son of Kunt\u012b; m\u016brtaya\u1e25\u2014forms;\nsambhavanti\u2014as they appear; y\u0101\u1e25\u2014which; t\u0101s\u0101m\u2014all of them; brahma\u2014supreme; mahat\nyoni\u1e25\u2014the source of birth in the material substance; aham\u2014Myself;\nb\u012bja-prada\u1e25\u2014seed-giving; pit\u0101\u2014father.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nIt should be understood that all species of life, O son of Kunt\u012b, are made\npossible by birth in this material nature, and that I am the seed-giving father.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nIn this verse it is clearly explained that the Supreme Personality of Godhead,\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is the original father of all living entities. The living entities are\ncombinations of the material nature and the spiritual nature. Such living\nentities are seen not only on this planet, but in every planet, even in the\nhighest where Brahm\u0101 is situated. Everywhere there are living entities; within\nthe earth there are living entities, even within water and within fire. All\nthese appearances are due to the mother, material nature, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s\nseed-giving process. The purport is that the living entities, being impregnated\nin the material world, come out and form at the time of creation according to\ntheir past deeds.\n\n\n14.5\n\n\nsattva\u1e41 rajas tama iti\n\n\ngu\u1e47\u0101\u1e25 prak\u1e5bti-sambhav\u0101\u1e25\n\n\nnibadhnanti mah\u0101-b\u0101ho\n\n\ndehe dehinam avyayam\n\n\nsattvam\u2014mode of goodness; raja\u1e25\u2014mode of passion; tama\u1e25\u2014mode of ignorance;\niti\u2014thus; gu\u1e47\u0101\u1e25\u2014qualities; prak\u1e5bti\u2014material nature; sambhav\u0101\u1e25\u2014produced of;\nnibadhnanti\u2014does condition; mah\u0101-b\u0101ho\u2014O mighty-armed one; dehe\u2014in this body;\ndehinam\u2014the living entity; avyayam\u2014eternal.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nMaterial nature consists of the three modes\u2014goodness, passion and ignorance.\nWhen the living entity comes in contact with nature, he becomes conditioned by\nthese modes.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe living entity, because he is transcendental, has nothing to do with this\nmaterial nature. Still, because he has become conditioned by the material world,\nhe is acting under the spell of the three modes of material nature. Because\nliving entities have different kinds of bodies, in terms of the different\naspects of nature, they are induced to act according to that nature. This is the\ncause of the varieties of happiness and distress.\n\n\n14.6\n\n\ntatra sattva\u1e41 nirmalatv\u0101t\n\n\nprak\u0101\u015bakam an\u0101mayam\n\n\nsukha-sa\u1e45gena badhn\u0101ti\n\n\nj\u00f1\u0101na-sa\u1e45gena c\u0101nagha\n\n\ntatra\u2014thereafter; sattvam\u2014mode of goodness; nirmalatv\u0101t\u2014being purest in the\nmaterial world; prak\u0101\u015bakam\u2014illuminating; an\u0101mayam\u2014without any sinful reachon;\nsukha\u2014happiness; sa\u1e45gena\u2014association; badhn\u0101ti\u2014conditions; j\u00f1\u0101na\u2014knowledge;\nsa\u1e45gena\u2014association; ca\u2014also; anagha\u2014O sinless one.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nO sinless one, the mode of goodness, being purer than the others, is\nilluminating, and it frees one from all sinful reactions. Those situated in that\nmode develop knowledge, but they become conditioned by the concept of happiness.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe living entities conditioned by material nature are of various types. One is\nhappy, another is very active, and another is helpless. All these types of\npsychological manifestations are causes of the entities\u2019 conditioned status in\nnature. How they are differently conditioned is explained in this section of\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. The mode of goodness is first considered. The effect of\ndeveloping the mode of goodness in the material world is that one becomes wiser\nthan those otherwise conditioned. A man in the mode of goodness is not so much\naffected by material miseries, and he has a sense of advancement in material\nknowledge. The representative type is the br\u0101hma\u1e47a, who is supposed to be\nsituated in the mode of goodness. This sense of happiness is due to\nunderstanding that, in the mode of goodness, one is more or less free from\nsinful reactions. Actually, in the Vedic literature it is said that the mode of\ngoodness means greater knowledge and a greater sense of happiness.\n\n\nThe difficulty here is that when a living entity is situated in the mode of\ngoodness, he becomes conditioned to feel that he is advanced in knowledge and is\nbetter than others. In this way he becomes conditioned. The best examples are\nthe scientist and philosopher: each is very proud of his knowledge, and because\nthey generally improve their living conditions, they feel a sort of material\nhappiness. This sense of advanced happiness in conditioned life makes them bound\nby the mode of goodness of material nature. As such, they are attracted toward\nworking in the mode of goodness, and, as long as they have an attraction for\nworking in that way, they have to take some type of body in the modes of nature.\nThus there is no likelihood of liberation, or of being transferred to the\nspiritual world. Repeatedly, one may become a philosopher, a scientist, or a\npoet, and, repeatedly, become entangled in the same disadvantages of birth and\ndeath. But, due to the illusion of the material energy, one thinks that that\nsort of life is pleasant.\n\n\n14.7\n\n\nrajo r\u0101g\u0101tmaka\u1e41 viddhi\n\n\nt\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47\u0101-sa\u1e45ga-samudbhavam\n\n\ntan nibadhn\u0101ti kaunteya\n\n\nkarma-sa\u1e45gena dehinam\n\n\nraja\u1e25\u2014mode of passion; r\u0101ga-\u0101tmakam\u2014born of desire or lust; viddhi\u2014know;\nt\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47\u0101\u2014hankering; sa\u1e45ga\u2014association; samudbhavam\u2014produced of; tat\u2014that;\nnibadhn\u0101ti\u2014is bound; kaunteya\u2014O son of Kunt\u012b; karma-sa\u1e45gena\u2014association with\nfruitive activity; dehinam\u2014of the embodied.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThe mode of passion is born of unlimited desires and longings, O son of Kunt\u012b,\nand because of this one is bound to material fruitive activities.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe mode of passion is characterized by the attraction between man and woman.\nWoman has attraction for man, and man has attraction for woman. This is called\nthe mode of passion. And, when the mode of passion is increased, one develops\nthe hankering for material enjoyment. He wants to enjoy sense gratification. For\nsense gratification, a man in the mode of passion wants some honor in society,\nor in the nation, and he wants to have a happy family, with nice children, wife,\nand house. These are the products of the mode of passion. As long as one is\nhankering after these things, he has to work very hard. Therefore it is clearly\nstated here that he becomes associated with the fruits of his activities and\nthus becomes bound by such activities. In order to please his wife, children and\nsociety and to keep up his prestige, one has to work. Therefore, the whole\nmaterial world is more or less in the mode of passion. Modern civilization is\nconsidered to be advanced in the standards of the mode of passion. Formerly, the\nadvanced condition was considered to be in the mode of goodness. If there is no\nliberation for those in the mode of goodness, what of those who are entangled in\nthe mode of passion?\n\n\n14.8\n\n\ntamas tv aj\u00f1\u0101na-ja\u1e41 viddhi\n\n\nmohana\u1e41 sarva-dehin\u0101m\n\n\npram\u0101d\u0101lasya-nidr\u0101bhis\n\n\ntan nibadhn\u0101ti bh\u0101rata\n\n\ntama\u1e25\u2014mode of ignorance; tu\u2014but; aj\u00f1\u0101na-jam\u2014products of ignorance;\nviddhi\u2014knowing; mohanam\u2014delusion; sarva-dehin\u0101m\u2014of all embodied beings;\npram\u0101da\u2014madness; \u0101lasya\u2014indolence; nidr\u0101bhi\u1e25\u2014sleep; tat\u2014that; nibadhn\u0101ti\u2014binds;\nbh\u0101rata\u2014O son of Bharata.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nO son of Bharata, the mode of ignorance causes the delusion of all living\nentities. The result of this mode is madness, indolence and sleep, which bind\nthe conditioned soul.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nIn this verse the specific application of the word tu is very significant. This\nmeans that the mode of ignorance is a very peculiar qualification of the\nembodied soul. This mode of ignorance is just the opposite of the mode of\ngoodness. In the mode of goodness, by development of knowledge, one can\nunderstand what is what, but the mode of ignorance is just the opposite.\nEveryone under the spell of the mode of ignorance becomes mad, and a madman\ncannot understand what is what. Instead of making advancement, one becomes\ndegraded. The definition of the mode of ignorance is stated in the Vedic\nliterature: under the spell of ignorance, one cannot understand the thing as it\nis. For example, everyone can see that his grandfather has died, and therefore\nhe will also die; man is mortal. The children that he conceives will also die.\nSo death is sure. Still, people are madly accumulating money and working very\nhard all day and night, not caring for the eternal spirit. This is madness. In\ntheir madness, they are very reluctant to make advancement in spiritual\nunderstanding. Such people are very lazy. When they are invited to associate for\nspiritual understanding, they are not much interested. They are not even active\nlike the man who is controlled by the mode of passion. Thus another symptom of\none embedded in the mode of ignorance is that he sleeps more than is required.\nSix hours of sleep is sufficient, but a man in the mode of ignorance sleeps at\nleast ten or twelve hours a day. Such a man appears to be always dejected, and\nis addicted to intoxicants and sleeping. These are the symptoms of a person\nconditioned by the mode of ignorance.\n\n\n14.9\n\n\nsattva\u1e41 sukhe sa\u00f1jayati\n\n\nraja\u1e25 karma\u1e47i bh\u0101rata\n\n\nj\u00f1\u0101nam \u0101v\u1e5btya tu tama\u1e25\n\n\npram\u0101de sa\u00f1jayaty uta\n\n\nsattvam\u2014mode of goodness; sukhe\u2014in happiness; sa\u00f1jayati\u2014develops; raja\u1e25\u2014mode of\npassion; karma\u1e47i\u2014fruits of activities; bh\u0101rata\u2014O son of Bharata;\nj\u00f1\u0101nam\u2014knowledge; \u0101v\u1e5btya\u2014covering; tu\u2014but; tama\u1e25\u2014the mode of ignorance;\npram\u0101de\u2014in madness; sa\u00f1jayati\u2014develops; uta\u2014it is said.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThe mode of goodness conditions one to happiness, passion conditions him to the\nfruits of action, and ignorance to madness.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nA person in the mode of goodness is satisfied by his work or intellectual\npursuit, just as a philosopher, scientist, or educator may be engaged in a\nparticular field of knowledge and may be satisfied in that way. A man in the\nmodes of passion and goodness may be engaged in fruitive activity; he owns as\nmuch as he can and spends for good causes. Sometimes he tries to open hospitals,\ngive to charity institutions, etc. These are the signs of one in the mode of\npassion. And the mode of ignorance covers knowledge. In the mode of ignorance,\nwhatever one does is neither good for him nor for anyone.\n\n\n14.10\n\n\nrajas tama\u015b c\u0101bhibh\u016bya\n\n\nsattva\u1e41 bhavati bh\u0101rata\n\n\nraja\u1e25 sattva\u1e41 tama\u015b caiva\n\n\ntama\u1e25 sattva\u1e41 rajas tath\u0101\n\n\nraja\u1e25\u2014mode of passion; tama\u1e25\u2014mode of ignorance; ca\u2014also; abhibh\u016bya\u2014also\nsurpassing; sattvam\u2014mode of goodness; bhavati\u2014becomes prominent; bh\u0101rata\u2014O son\nof Bharata; raja\u1e25\u2014mode of passion; sattvam\u2014mode of goodness; tama\u1e25\u2014mode of\nignorance; ca\u2014also; eva\u2014like that; tama\u1e25\u2014mode of ignorance; sattvam\u2014mode of\ngoodness; raja\u1e25\u2014mode of passion; tath\u0101\u2014as in this.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nSometimes the mode of passion becomes prominent, defeating the mode of goodness,\nO son of Bharata. And sometimes the mode of goodness defeats passion, and at\nother times the mode of ignorance defeats goodness and passion. In this way\nthere is always competition for supremacy.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nWhen the mode of passion is prominent, the modes of goodness and ignorance are\ndefeated. When the mode of goodness is prominent, passion and ignorance are\ndefeated. And, when the mode of ignorance is prominent, passion and goodness are\ndefeated. This competition is always going on. Therefore, one who is actually\nintent on advancing in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness has to transcend these three modes.\nThe prominence of some certain mode of nature is manifested in one\u2019s dealings,\nin his activities, in eating, etc. All this will be explained in later chapters.\nBut if one wants, he can develop, by practice, the mode of goodness and thus\ndefeat the modes of ignorance and passion. One can similarly develop the mode of\npassion and defeat goodness and ignorance. Or, one can develop the mode of\nignorance and defeat goodness and passion. Although there are these three modes\nof material nature, if one is determined, he can be blessed by the mode of\ngoodness, and, by transcending the mode of goodness, he can be situated in pure\ngoodness, which is called the v\u0101sudeva state, a state in which one can\nunderstand the science of God. By the manifestation of particular activities, it\ncan be understood in what mode of nature one is situated.\n\n\n14.11\n\n\nsarva-dv\u0101re\u1e63u dehe \u2019smin\n\n\nprak\u0101\u015ba upaj\u0101yate\n\n\nj\u00f1\u0101na\u1e41 yad\u0101 tad\u0101 vidy\u0101d\n\n\nviv\u1e5bddha\u1e41 sattvam ity uta\n\n\nsarva-dv\u0101re\u1e63u\u2014all the gates; dehe asmin\u2014in this body; prak\u0101\u015ba\u1e25\u2014quality of\nillumination; upaj\u0101yate\u2014develops; j\u00f1\u0101nam\u2014knowledge; yad\u0101\u2014when; tad\u0101\u2014at that\ntime; vidy\u0101t\u2014must know; viv\u1e5bddham\u2014increased; sattvam\u2014mode of goodness; iti\u2014thus;\nuta\u2014said.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThe manifestations of the mode of goodness can be experienced when all the gates\nof the body are illuminated by knowledge.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThere are nine gates in the body: two eyes, two ears, two nostrils, the mouth,\nthe genital and the anus.

This is incorrect. According to this verse, if\none develops the mode of ignorance, after his death he is degraded to the animal\nform of life. From there one has to again elevate himself, by evolutionary\nprocess, to come again to the human form of life. Therefore, those who are\nactually serious about human life should take to the mode of goodness and in\ngood association transcend the modes and become situated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\nThis is the aim of human life. Otherwise, there is no guarantee that the human\nbeing will again attain to the human status.\n\n\n14.16\n\n\nkarma\u1e47a\u1e25 suk\u1e5btasy\u0101hu\u1e25\n\n\ns\u0101ttvika\u1e41 nirmala\u1e41 phalam\n\n\nrajasas tu phala\u1e41 du\u1e25kham\n\n\naj\u00f1\u0101na\u1e41 tamasa\u1e25 phalam\n\n\nkarma\u1e47a\u1e25\u2014of work; suk\u1e5btasya\u2014in the mode of goodness; \u0101hu\u1e25\u2014said; s\u0101ttvikam\u2014mode\nof goodness; nirmalam\u2014purified; phalam\u2014result; rajasa\u1e25\u2014of the mode of passion;\ntu\u2014but; phalam\u2014result; du\u1e25kham\u2014misery; aj\u00f1\u0101nam\u2014nonsense; tamasa\u1e25\u2014of the mode of\nignorance; phalam\u2014result.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nBy acting in the mode of goodness, one becomes purified. Works done in the mode\nof passion result in distress, and actions performed in the mode of ignorance\nresult in foolishness.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nBy pious activities in the mode of goodness one is purified; therefore the\nsages, who are free from all illusion, are situated in happiness. Similarly,\nactivities in the mode of passion are simply miserable. Any activity for\nmaterial happiness is bound to be defeated. If, for example, one wants to have a\nskyscraper, so much human misery has to be undergone before a big skyscraper can\nbe built. The financier has to take much trouble to earn a mass of wealth, and\nthose who are slaving to construct the building have to render physical toil.\nThe miseries are there. Thus Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 says that in any activity performed\nunder the spell of the mode of passion, there is definitely great misery. There\nmay be a little so-called mental happiness\u2014\u201cI have this house or this money\u201d\u2014but\nthis is not actual happiness. As far as the mode of ignorance is concerned, the\nperformer is without knowledge, and therefore all his activities result in\npresent misery, and afterwards he will go on toward animal life. Animal life is\nalways miserable, although, under the spell of the illusory energy, m\u0101y\u0101, the\nanimals do not understand this. Slaughtering poor animals is also due to the\nmode of ignorance. The animal killers do not know that in the future the animal\nwill have a body suitable to kill them. That is the law of nature. In human\nsociety, if one kills a man he has to be hanged. That is the law of the state.\nBecause of ignorance, people do not perceive that there is a complete state\ncontrolled by the Supreme Lord. Every living creature is the son of the Supreme\nLord, and He does not tolerate even an ant\u2019s being killed. One has to pay for\nit. So, indulgence in animal killing for the taste of the tongue is the grossest\nkind of ignorance. A human being has no need to kill animals because God has\nsupplied so many nice things. If one indulges in meat-eating anyway, it is to be\nunderstood that he is acting in ignorance and is making his future very dark. Of\nall kinds of animal killing, the killing of cows is most vicious because the cow\ngives us all kinds of pleasure by supplying milk. Cow slaughter is an act of the\ngrossest type of ignorance. In the Vedic literature the words gobhi\u1e25\npr\u012b\u1e47ita-matsaram indicate that one who, being fully satisfied by milk, is\ndesirous of killing the cow, is in the grossest ignorance. There is also a\nprayer in the Vedic literature that states:\n\n\nnamo brahma\u1e47ya-dev\u0101ya go-br\u0101hma\u1e47a-hit\u0101ya ca jagaddhit\u0101ya k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47\u0101ya govind\u0101ya namo\nnama\u1e25.\n\n\n\u201cMy Lord, You are the well-wisher of the cows and the br\u0101hma\u1e47as, and You are the\nwell-wisher of the entire human society and world.\u201d The purport is that special\nmention is given in that prayer for the protection of the cows and the\nbr\u0101hma\u1e47as. Br\u0101hma\u1e47as are the symbol of spiritual education, and cows are the\nsymbol of the most valuable food; these two living creatures, the br\u0101hma\u1e47as and\nthe cows, must be given all protection\u2014that is real advancement of civilization.\nIn modern human society, spiritual knowledge is neglected, and cow killing is\nencouraged. It is to be understood, then, that human society is advancing in the\nwrong direction and is clearing the path to its own condemnation. A civilization\nwhich guides the citizens to become animals in their next lives is certainly not\na human civilization. The present human civilization is, of course, grossly\nmisled by the modes of passion and ignorance. It is a very dangerous age, and\nall nations should take care to provide the easiest process, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness, to save humanity from the greatest danger.\n\n\n14.17\n\n\nsattv\u0101t sa\u00f1j\u0101yate j\u00f1\u0101na\u1e41\n\n\nrajaso lobha eva ca\n\n\npram\u0101da-mohau tamaso\n\n\nbhavato \u2019j\u00f1\u0101nam eva ca\n\n\nsattv\u0101t\u2014from the mode of goodness; sa\u00f1j\u0101yate\u2014develops; j\u00f1\u0101nam\u2014knowledge;\nrajasa\u1e25\u2014from the mode of passion; lobha\u1e25\u2014greed; eva\u2014certainly; ca\u2014also;\npram\u0101da\u2014madness; mohau\u2014illusion; tamasa\u1e25\u2014from the mode of ignorance;\nbhavata\u1e25\u2014develops; aj\u00f1\u0101nam\u2014nonsense; eva\u2014certainly; ca\u2014also.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nFrom the mode of goodness, real knowledge develops; from the mode of passion,\ngrief develops; and from the mode of ignorance, foolishness, madness and\nillusion develop.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nSince the present civilization is not very congenial to the living entities,\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is recommended. Through K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, society will\ndevelop the mode of goodness. When the mode of goodness is developed, people\nwill see things as they are. In the mode of ignorance, people are just like\nanimals and cannot see things clearly. In the mode of ignorance, for example,\nthey do not see that by killing one animal they are taking a chance of being\nkilled by the same animal in the next life. Because people have no education in\nactual knowledge, they become irresponsible. To stop this irresponsibility,\neducation for developing the mode of goodness of the people in general must be\nthere. When they are actually educated in the mode of goodness, they will become\nsober, in full knowledge of things as they are. Then people will be happy and\nprosperous. Even if the majority of the people aren\u2019t happy and prosperous, if a\ncertain percentage of the population develops K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and becomes\nsituated in the mode of goodness, then there is the possibility for peace and\nprosperity all over the world. Otherwise, if the world is devoted to the modes\nof passion and ignorance, there can be no peace or prosperity. In the mode of\npassion, people become greedy, and their hankering for sense enjoyment has no\nlimit. One can see that even if one has enough money and adequate arrangement\nfor sense gratification, there is neither happiness nor peace of mind. That is\nnot possible because one is situated in the mode of passion. If one wants\nhappiness at all, his money will not help him; he has to elevate himself to the\nmode of goodness by practicing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. One engaged in the mode of\npassion is not only mentally unhappy, but his profession and occupation are also\nvery troublesome. He has to devise so many plans and schemes to acquire enough\nmoney to maintain his status quo. This is all miserable. In the mode of\nignorance, people become mad. Being distressed by their circumstances, they take\nshelter of intoxication, and thus they sink further into ignorance. Their future\nin life is very dark.\n\n\n14.18\n\n\n\u016brdhva\u1e41 gacchanti sattva-sth\u0101\n\n\nmadhye ti\u1e63\u1e6dhanti r\u0101jas\u0101\u1e25\n\n\njaghanya-gu\u1e47a-v\u1e5btti-sth\u0101\n\n\nadho gacchanti t\u0101mas\u0101\u1e25\n\n\n\u016brdhvam\u2014upwards; gacchanti\u2014goes; sattva-sth\u0101\u1e25\u2014one who is situated in the mode of\ngoodness; madhye\u2014in the middle; ti\u1e63\u1e6dhanti\u2014dwell; r\u0101jas\u0101\u1e25\u2014those who are situated\nin the mode of passion; jaghanya\u2014abominable; gu\u1e47a\u2014quality;\nv\u1e5btti-sth\u0101\u1e25\u2014occupation; adha\u1e25\u2014down; gacchanti\u2014go; t\u0101mas\u0101\u1e25\u2014persons in the mode of\nignorance.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThose situated in the mode of goodness gradually go upward to the higher\nplanets; those in the mode of passion live on the earthly planets; and those in\nthe mode of ignorance go down to the hellish worlds.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nIn this verse the results of actions in the three modes of nature are more\nexplicitly set forth. There is an upper planetary system, consisting of the\nheavenly planets, where everyone is highly elevated. According to the degree of\ndevelopment of the mode of goodness, the living entity can be transferred to\nvarious planets in this system. The highest planet is Satyaloka, or Brahmaloka,\nwhere the prime person of this universe, Lord Brahm\u0101, resides. We have seen\nalready that we can hardly calculate the wondrous condition of life in\nBrahmaloka, but the highest condition of life, the mode of goodness, can bring\nus to this.\n\n\nThe mode of passion is mixed. It is in the middle, between the modes of goodness\nand ignorance. A person is not always pure, but even if he should be purely in\nthe mode of passion, he will simply remain on this earth as a king or a rich\nman. But because there are mixtures, one can also go down. People on this earth,\nin the modes of passion or ignorance, cannot forcibly approach the higher\nplanets by machine. In the mode of passion, there is also the chance of becoming\nmad in the next life.\n\n\nThe lowest quality, the mode of ignorance, is described here as abominable. The\nresult of developing ignorance is very, very risky. It is the lowest quality in\nmaterial nature. Beneath the human level there are eight million species of\nlife: birds, beasts, reptiles, trees, etc., and, according to the development of\nthe mode of ignorance, people are brought down to these abominable conditions.\nThe word t\u0101mas\u0101\u1e25 is very significant here. T\u0101mas\u0101\u1e25 indicates those who stay\ncontinually in the mode of ignorance without rising to a higher mode. Their\nfuture is very dark.\n\n\nThere is opportunity for men in the modes of ignorance and passion to be\nelevated to the mode of goodness, and that system is called K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\nBut one who does not take advantage of this opportunity certainly will continue\nin the lower modes.\n\n\n14.19\n\n\nn\u0101nya\u1e41 gu\u1e47ebhya\u1e25 kart\u0101ra\u1e41\n\n\nyad\u0101 dra\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101nupa\u015byati\n\n\ngu\u1e47ebhya\u015b ca para\u1e41 vetti\n\n\nmad-bh\u0101va\u1e41 so \u2019dhigacchati\n\n\nna\u2014never; anyam\u2014other than; gu\u1e47ebhya\u1e25\u2014from the qualities; kart\u0101ram\u2014the\nperformer; yad\u0101\u2014when; dra\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101 anupa\u015byati\u2014he who sees properly; gu\u1e47ebhya\u1e25 ca\u2014from\nthe modes of nature; param\u2014transcendental; vetti\u2014know; mat-bh\u0101vam\u2014My spiritual\nnature; sa\u1e25\u2014he; adhigacchati\u2014is promoted.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nWhen you see that there is nothing beyond these modes of nature in all\nactivities and that the Supreme Lord is transcendental to all these modes, then\nyou can know My spiritual nature.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nOne can transcend all the activities of the modes of material nature simply by\nunderstanding them properly by learning from the proper souls. The real\nspiritual master is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and He is imparting this spiritual knowledge to\nArjuna. Similarly, it is from those who are fully in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness that\none has to learn this science of activities in terms of the modes of nature.\nOtherwise, one\u2019s life will be misdirected. By the instruction of a bona fide\nspiritual master, a living entity can know of his spiritual position, his\nmaterial body, his senses, how he is entrapped, and how he is under the spell of\nthe material modes of nature. He is helpless, being in the grip of these modes,\nbut when he can see his real position, then he can attain to the transcendental\nplatform, having the scope for spiritual life. Actually, the living entity is\nnot the performer of different activities. He is forced to act because he is\nsituated in a particular type of body, conducted by some particular mode of\nmaterial nature. Unless one has the help of spiritual authority, he cannot\nunderstand in what position he is actually situated. With the association of a\nbona fide spiritual master, he can see his real position, and, by such an\nunderstanding, he can become fixed in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. A man in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness is not controlled by the spell of the material modes of nature. It\nhas already been stated in the Seventh Chapter that one who has surrendered to\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is relieved from the activities of material nature. Therefore for one who\nis able to see things as they are, the influence of material nature gradually\nceases.\n\n\n14.20\n\n\ngu\u1e47\u0101n et\u0101n at\u012btya tr\u012bn\n\n\ndeh\u012b deha-samudbhav\u0101n\n\n\njanma-m\u1e5btyu-jar\u0101-du\u1e25khair\n\n\nvimukto \u2019m\u1e5btam a\u015bnute\n\n\ngu\u1e47\u0101n\u2014qualities; et\u0101n\u2014all these; at\u012btya\u2014transcending; tr\u012bn\u2014three; deh\u012b\u2014body;\ndeha\u2014body; samudbhav\u0101n\u2014produced of; janma\u2014birth; m\u1e5btyu\u2014death; jar\u0101\u2014old age;\ndu\u1e25khai\u1e25\u2014distresses; vimukta\u1e25\u2014being freed from; am\u1e5btam\u2014nectar; a\u015bnute\u2014enjoys.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nWhen the embodied being is able to transcend these three modes, he can become\nfree from birth, death, old age and their distresses and can enjoy nectar even\nin this life.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nHow one can stay in the transcendental position, even in this body, in full\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, is explained in this verse. The Sanskrit word deh\u012b means\nembodied. Although one is within this material body, by his advancement in\nspiritual knowledge he can be free from the influence of the modes of nature. He\ncan enjoy the happiness of spiritual life even in this body because, after\nleaving this body, he is certainly going to the spiritual sky. But even in this\nbody he can enjoy spiritual happiness. In other words, devotional service in\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is the sign of liberation from this material entanglement,\nand this will be explained in the Eighteenth Chapter. When one is freed from the\ninfluence of the modes of material nature, he enters into devotional service.\n\n\n14.21\n\n\narjuna uv\u0101ca\n\n\nkair li\u1e45gais tr\u012bn gu\u1e47\u0101n et\u0101n\n\n\nat\u012bto bhavati prabho\n\n\nkim \u0101c\u0101ra\u1e25 katha\u1e41 cait\u0101\u1e41s\n\n\ntr\u012bn gu\u1e47\u0101n ativartate\n\n\narjuna\u1e25 uv\u0101ca\u2014Arjuna said; kai\u1e25\u2014by which; li\u1e45gai\u1e25\u2014symptoms; tr\u012bn\u2014three;\ngu\u1e47\u0101n\u2014qualities; et\u0101n\u2014all this; at\u012bta\u1e25\u2014transcend; bhavati\u2014become; prabho\u2014my\nLord; kim\u2014what; \u0101c\u0101ra\u1e25\u2014behavior; katham\u2014what; ca\u2014also; et\u0101n\u2014these; tr\u012bn\u2014three;\ngu\u1e47\u0101n\u2014qualities; ativartate\u2014transcend.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nArjuna inquired: O my dear Lord, by what symptoms is one known who is\ntranscendental to those modes? What is his behavior? And how does he transcend\nthe modes of nature?\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nIn this verse, Arjuna\u2019s questions are very appropriate. He wants to know the\nsymptoms of a person who has already transcended the material modes. He first\ninquires of the symptoms of such a transcendental person. How can one understand\nthat he has already transcended the influence of the modes of material nature?\nThe second question asks how he lives and what his activities are. Are they\nregulated or nonregulated? Then Arjuna inquires of the means by which he can\nattain the transcendental nature. That is very important. Unless one knows the\ndirect means by which one can be situated always transcendentally, there is no\npossibility of showing the symptoms. So all these questions put by Arjuna are\nvery important, and the Lord answers them.\n\n\n14.22-25\n\n\n\u015br\u012b-bhagav\u0101n uv\u0101ca\n\n\nprak\u0101\u015ba\u1e41 ca prav\u1e5btti\u1e41 ca\n\n\nmoham eva ca p\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dava\n\n\nna dve\u1e63\u1e6di samprav\u1e5btt\u0101ni\n\n\nna niv\u1e5btt\u0101ni k\u0101\u1e45k\u1e63ati\n\n\nud\u0101s\u012bna-vad \u0101s\u012bno\n\n\ngu\u1e47air yo na vic\u0101lyate\n\n\ngu\u1e47\u0101 vartanta ity eva\u1e41\n\n\nyo \u2019vati\u1e63\u1e6dhati ne\u1e45gate\n\n\nsama-du\u1e25kha-sukha\u1e25 sva-stha\u1e25\n\n\nsama-lo\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u015bma-k\u0101\u00f1cana\u1e25\n\n\ntulya-priy\u0101priyo dh\u012bras\n\n\ntulya-nind\u0101tma-sa\u1e41stuti\u1e25\n\n\nm\u0101n\u0101pam\u0101nayos tulyas\n\n\ntulyo mitr\u0101ri-pak\u1e63ayo\u1e25\n\n\nsarv\u0101rambha-parity\u0101g\u012b\n\n\ngu\u1e47\u0101t\u012bta\u1e25 sa ucyate\n\n\n\u015br\u012b bhagav\u0101n uv\u0101ca\u2014the Supreme Personality of Godhead said; prak\u0101\u015bam ca\u2014and\nillumination; prav\u1e5bttim ca\u2014and attachment; moham\u2014illusion; eva ca\u2014also;\np\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dava\u2014O son of P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du; na dve\u1e63\u1e6di\u2014does not hate; samprav\u1e5btt\u0101ni\u2014although\ndeveloped; na niv\u1e5btt\u0101ni\u2014nor stop development; k\u0101\u1e45k\u1e63ati\u2014desires; ud\u0101s\u012bnavat\u2014as if\nneutral; \u0101s\u012bna\u1e25\u2014situated; gu\u1e47ai\u1e25\u2014by the qualities; ya\u1e25\u2014one who; na\u2014never;\nvic\u0101lyate\u2014is agitated; gu\u1e47\u0101\u1e25\u2014the qualities; vartante\u2014is situated; iti\nevam\u2014knowing thus; ya\u1e25\u2014one who; avati\u1e63\u1e6dhati\u2014remains; na\u2014never;\ni\u1e45gate\u2014flickering; sama\u2014equally; du\u1e25kha\u2014in distress; sukha\u1e25\u2014in happiness;\nsvastha\u1e25\u2014being situated himself; sama\u2014equally; lo\u1e63\u1e6da\u2014a lump of earth;\na\u015bma\u2014stone; k\u0101\u00f1cana\u1e25\u2014gold; tulya\u2014equally disposed; priya\u2014dear;\napriya\u1e25\u2014undesirable; dh\u012bra\u1e25\u2014steadily; tulya\u2014equally; nind\u0101\u2014in defamation;\n\u0101tma-sa\u1e41stuti\u1e25\u2014in praise of himself; m\u0101na\u2014honor; apam\u0101nayo\u1e25\u2014dishonor;\ntulya\u1e25\u2014equally; tulya\u1e25\u2014equally; mitra\u2014friend; ari\u2014enemy; pak\u1e63ayo\u1e25\u2014in party;\nsarva\u2014all; \u0101rambha\u1e25\u2014endeavor; parity\u0101g\u012b\u2014renouncer; gu\u1e47a-at\u012bta\u1e25\u2014transcendental to\nthe material modes of nature; sa\u1e25\u2014he; ucyate\u2014is said to be.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThe Blessed Lord said: He who does not hate illumination, attachment and\ndelusion when they are present, nor longs for them when they disappear; who is\nseated like one unconcerned, being situated beyond these material reactions of\nthe modes of nature, who remains firm, knowing that the modes alone are active;\nwho regards alike pleasure and pain, and looks on a clod, a stone and a piece of\ngold with an equal eye; who is wise and holds praise and blame to be the same;\nwho is unchanged in honor and dishonor, who treats friend and foe alike, who has\nabandoned all fruitive undertakings\u2014such a man is said to have transcended the\nmodes of nature.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nArjuna submitted the three different questions, and the Lord answers them one\nafter another. In these verses, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a first indicates that a person\ntranscendentally situated neither envies anyone nor hankers for anything. When a\nliving entity stays in this material world embodied by the material body, it is\nto be understood that he is under the control of one of the three modes of\nmaterial nature. When he is actually out of the body, then he is out of the\nclutches of the material modes of nature. But as long as he is not out of the\nmaterial body, he should be neutral. He should engage himself in the devotional\nservice of the Lord so that his identity with the material body will\nautomatically be forgotten. When one is conscious of the material body, he acts\nonly for sense gratification, but when one transfers the consciousness to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a,\nsense gratification automatically stops. One does not need this material body,\nand he does not need to accept the dictations of the material body. The\nqualities of the material modes in the body will act, but as spirit soul the\nself is aloof from such activities. How does he become aloof? He does not desire\nto enjoy the body, nor does he desire to get out of it. Thus transcendentally\nsituated, the devotee becomes automatically free. He need not try to become free\nfrom the influence of the modes of material nature.\n\n\nThe next question concerns the dealings of a transcendentally situated person.\nThe materially situated person is affected by so-called honor and dishonor\noffered to the body, but the transcendentally situated person is not affected by\nsuch false honor and dishonor. He performs his duty in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and\ndoes not mind whether a man honors or dishonors him. He accepts things that are\nfavorable for his duty in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, otherwise he has no necessity of\nanything material, either a stone or gold. He takes everyone as his dear friend\nwho helps him in his execution of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, and he does not hate his\nso-called enemy. He is equally disposed and sees everything on an equal level\nbecause he knows perfectly well that he has nothing to do with material\nexistence. Social and political issues do not affect him because he knows the\nsituation of temporary upheavals and disturbances. He does not attempt anything\nfor his own sake. He can attempt anything for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but for his personal self\nhe does not attain anything. By such behavior one becomes actually\ntranscendentally situated.\n\n\n14.26\n\n\nm\u0101\u1e41 ca yo \u2019vyabhic\u0101re\u1e47a\n\n\nbhakti-yogena sevate\n\n\nsa gu\u1e47\u0101n samat\u012btyait\u0101n\n\n\nbrahma-bh\u016by\u0101ya kalpate\n\n\nm\u0101m\u2014unto Me; ca\u2014also; ya\u1e25\u2014person; avyabhic\u0101re\u1e47a\u2014without fail; bhakti-yogena\u2014by\ndevotional service; sevate\u2014renders service; sa\u1e25\u2014he; gu\u1e47\u0101n\u2014all the modes of\nmaterial nature; samat\u012btya\u2014transcending; et\u0101n\u2014all this; brahma-bh\u016by\u0101ya\u2014to be\nelevated on the Brahman platform; kalpate\u2014is considered.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nOne who engages in full devotional service, who does not fall down in any\ncircumstance, at once transcends the modes of material nature and thus comes to\nthe level of Brahman.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThis verse is a reply to Arjuna\u2019s third question: What is the means of attaining\nto the transcendental position? As explained before, the material world is\nacting under the spell of the modes of material nature. One should not be\ndisturbed by the activities of the modes of nature; instead of putting his\nconsciousness into such activities, he may transfer his consciousness to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nactivities. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a activities are known as bhakti-yoga\u2014always acting for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\nThis includes not only K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but His different plenary expansions such as R\u0101ma\nand N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. He has innumerable expansions. One who is engaged in the service\nof any of the forms of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or of His plenary expansions, is considered to be\ntranscendentally situated. One should also note that all the forms of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are\nfully transcendental, blissful, full of knowledge and eternal. Such\npersonalities of Godhead are omnipotent and omniscient, and they possess all\ntranscendental qualities. So, if one engages himself in the service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or\nHis plenary expansions with unfailing determination, although these modes of\nmaterial nature are very difficult to overcome, he can overcome them easily.\nThis is already explained in the Seventh Chapter. One who surrenders unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nat once surmounts the influence of the modes of material nature. To be in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness or in devotional service means to acquire the equality of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\nThe Lord says that His nature is eternal, blissful and full of knowledge, and\nthe living entities are part and parcel of the Supreme, as gold particles are\npart of a gold mine. Thus the living entity\u2019s spiritual position is as good as\ngold, as good as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in quality. The difference of individuality continues,\notherwise there is no question of bhakti-yoga. Bhakti-yoga means that the Lord\nis there, the devotee is there and the activity of exchange of love between the\nLord and the devotee is there. Therefore the individuality of two persons is\npresent in the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the individual person,\notherwise there is no meaning to bhakti-yoga. If one is not situated in the same\ntranscendental position with the Lord, one cannot serve the Supreme Lord. To be\na personal assistant to a king, one must acquire the qualifications. Thus the\nqualification is to become Brahman, or freed from all material contamination. It\nis said in the Vedic literature: brahmaiva san brahm\u0101pyeti. One can attain the\nSupreme Brahman by becoming Brahman. This means that one must qualitatively\nbecome one with Brahman. By attainment of Brahman, one does not lose his eternal\nBrahman identity as individual soul.\n\n\n14.27\n\n\nbrahma\u1e47o hi prati\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101ham\n\n\nam\u1e5btasy\u0101vyayasya ca\n\n\n\u015b\u0101\u015bvatasya ca dharmasya\n\n\nsukhasyaik\u0101ntikasya ca\n\n\nbrahma\u1e47a\u1e25\u2014of the impersonal brahmajyoti; hi\u2014certainly; prati\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101\u2014the rest;\naham\u2014I am; am\u1e5btasya\u2014of the imperishable; avyayasya\u2014immortal; ca\u2014also;\n\u015b\u0101\u015bvatasya\u2014of eternal; ca\u2014and; dharmasya\u2014of the constitutional position;\nsukhasya\u2014happiness; aik\u0101ntikasya\u2014ultimate; ca\u2014also.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nAnd I am the basis of the impersonal Brahman, which is the constitutional\nposition of ultimate happiness, and which is immortal, imperishable and eternal.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe constitution of Brahman is immortality, imperishability, eternity, and\nhappiness. Brahman is the beginning of transcendental realization. Param\u0101tm\u0101,\nthe Supersoul, is the middle, the second stage in transcendental realization,\nand the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the ultimate realization of the\nAbsolute Truth. Therefore, both Param\u0101tm\u0101 and the impersonal Brahman are within\nthe Supreme Person. It is explained in the Seventh Chapter that material nature\nis the manifestation of the inferior energy of the Supreme Lord. The Lord\nimpregnates the inferior material nature with the fragments of the superior\nnature, and that is the spiritual touch in the material nature. When a living\nentity conditioned by this material nature begins the cultivation of spiritual\nknowledge, he elevates himself from the position of material existence and\ngradually rises up to the Brahman conception of the Supreme. This attainment of\nthe Brahman conception of life is the first stage in self-realization. At this\nstage the Brahman realized person is transcendental to the material position,\nbut he is not actually perfect in Brahman realization. If he wants, he can\ncontinue to stay in the Brahman position and then gradually rise up to Param\u0101tm\u0101\nrealization and then to the realization of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\nThere are many examples of this in Vedic literature. The four Kum\u0101ras were\nsituated first in the impersonal Brahman conception of truth, but then they\ngradually rose to the platform of devotional service. One who cannot elevate\nhimself beyond the impersonal conception of Brahman runs the risk of falling\ndown. In \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam it is stated that although a person may rise to the\nstage of impersonal Brahman, without going farther, with no information of the\nSupreme Person, his intelligence is not perfectly clear. Therefore, in spite of\nbeing raised to the Brahman platform, there is the chance of falling down if one\nis not engaged in the devotional service of the Lord. In the Vedic language it\nis also said: raso vai sa\u1e25; rasa\u1e41 hy ev\u0101ya\u1e41 labdhv\u0101nand\u012b bhavati. \u201cWhen one\nunderstands the Personality of God, the reservoir of pleasure, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he\nactually becomes transcendentally blissful.\u201d The Supreme Lord is full in six\nopulences, and when a devotee approaches Him, there is an exchange of these six\nopulences. The servant of the king enjoys on an almost equal level with the\nking. And so, eternal happiness, imperishable happiness, eternal life accompany\ndevotional service. Therefore, realization of Brahman, or eternity, or\nimperishability is included in devotional service. This is already possessed by\na person who is engaged in devotional service.\n\n\nThe living entity, although Brahman by nature, has the desire to lord it over\nthe material world, and due to this he falls down. In his constitutional\nposition, a living entity is above the three modes of material nature, but\nassociation with material nature entangles him in the different modes of\nmaterial nature, goodness, passion and ignorance. Due to the association of\nthese three modes, his desire to dominate the material world is there. By\nengagement in devotional service in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, he is immediately\nsituated in the transcendental position, and his unlawful desire to control\nmaterial nature is removed. Therefore the process of devotional service\nbeginning with hearing, chanting, remembering\u2014the prescribed nine methods for\nrealizing devotional service\u2014should be practiced in the association of devotees.\nGradually, by such association, by the influence of the spiritual master, one\u2019s\nmaterial desire to dominate is removed, and one becomes firmly situated in the\nLord\u2019s transcendental loving service. This method is prescribed from the\ntwenty-second to the last verse of this chapter. Devotional service to the Lord\nis very simple: one should always engage in the service of the Lord, should eat\nthe remnants of foodstuffs offered to the Deity, smell the flowers offered to\nthe lotus feet of the Lord, see the places where the Lord had His transcendental\npastimes, read of the different activities of the Lord, His reciprocation of\nlove with His devotees, chant always the transcendental vibration Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47na,\nHare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare,\nand observe the fasting days commemorating the appearances and disappearances of\nthe Lord and His devotees. By following such a process one becomes completely\ndetached from all material activities. One who can thus situate himself in the\nbrahmajyoti is equal to the Supreme Personality of Godhead in quality.",

In the Thirteenth Chapter, it was clearly explained that by\nhumbly developing knowledge one may possibly be freed from material\nentanglement. It has also been explained that it is due to association with the\nmodes of nature that the living entity is entangled in this material world. Now,\nin this chapter, the Supreme Personality explains what those modes of nature\nare, how they act, how they bind and how they give liberation. The knowledge\nexplained in this chapter is proclaimed by the Supreme Lord to be superior to\nthe knowledge given so far in other chapters. By understanding this knowledge,\nvarious great sages attain perfection and transfer to the spiritual world. The\nLord now explains the same knowledge in a better way. This knowledge is far, far\nsuperior to all other processes of knowledge thus far explained, and knowing\nthis many attain perfection. Thus it is expected that one who understands this\nFourteenth Chapter will attain perfection.",

TRANSLATION  By becoming fixed in this knowledge, one can attain to the transcendental\nnature, which is like My own nature. Thus established, one is not born at the\ntime of creation nor disturbed at the time of dissolution.  PURPORT  After acquiring perfect transcendental knowledge, one acquires qualitative\nequality with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, becoming free from the\nrepetition of birth and death. One does not, however, lose his identity as an\nindividual soul. It is understood from Vedic literature that the liberated souls\nwho have reached the transcendental planets of the spiritual sky always look to\nthe lotus feet of the Supreme Lord, being engaged in His transcendental loving\nservice. So, even after liberation, the devotees do not lose their individual\nidentities.  Generally, in the material world, whatever knowledge we get is contaminated by\nthe three modes of material nature. But knowledge which is not contaminated by\nthe three modes of nature is called transcendental knowledge. As soon as one is\nsituated in that transcendental knowledge, he is on the same platform as that of\nthe Supreme Person. Those who have no knowledge of the spiritual sky hold that\nafter being freed from the material activities of the material form, this\nspiritual identity becomes formless, without any variegatedness. However, just\nas there is material variegatedness in this world, so, in the spiritual world,\nthere is also variegatedness. Those in ignorance of this think that spiritual\nexistence is opposed to material variety. But actually, in the spiritual sky,\none attains spiritual form. There are spiritual activities, and the spiritual\nsituation is called devotional life. That atmosphere is said to be\nuncontaminated, and there one is equal in quality with the Supreme Lord. To\nobtain such knowledge, one must develop all the spiritual qualities. One who\nthus develops the spiritual qualities is not affected either by the creation or\nthe destruction of the material world.",

TRANSLATION  The total material substance, called Brahman, is the source of birth, and it is\nthat Brahman that I impregnate, making possible the births of all living beings,\nO son of Bharata.  PURPORT  This is an explanation of the world: everything that takes place is due to the\ncombination of k\u1e63etra and k\u1e63etraj\u00f1a, the body and the spirit soul. This\ncombination of material nature and the living entity is made possible by the\nSupreme God Himself. The mahat-tattva is the total cause of the total cosmic\nmanifestation, and because in the total substance of the material cause there\nare three modes of nature, it is sometimes called Brahman. The Supreme\nPersonality impregnates that total substance, and thus innumerable universes\nbecome possible. This total material substance, the mahat-tattva, is described\nas Brahman in the Vedic literature: tasm\u0101d etad brahma n\u0101ma-r\u016bpam anna\u1e41 ca\nj\u0101yate. Into that Brahman the seeds of the living entities are impregnated by\nthe Supreme Person. The twenty-four elements, beginning from earth, water, fire\nand air, are all material energy, called Mah\u0101-brahman, or the great Brahman, the\nmaterial nature. As is explained in the Seventh Chapter, beyond this there is\nanother, superior nature\u2014the living entity. In material nature the superior\nnature is mixed by the will of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and\nthereafter all living entities are born of this material nature.  The scorpion lays its eggs in piles of rice, and sometimes it is said that the\nscorpion is born out of rice. But the rice is not the cause of the scorpion.\nActually, the eggs were laid by the mother. Similarly, material nature is not\nthe cause of the birth of the living entities. The seed is given by the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead, and they only seem to come out as products of material\nnature. Thus every living entity, according to his past activities, has a\ndifferent body, created by this material nature, and the entity can enjoy or\nsuffer according to his past deeds. The Lord is the cause of all the\nmanifestations of living entities in this material world.",

TRANSLATION  O sinless one, the mode of goodness, being purer than the others, is\nilluminating, and it frees one from all sinful reactions. Those situated in that\nmode develop knowledge, but they become conditioned by the concept of happiness.  PURPORT  The living entities conditioned by material nature are of various types. One is\nhappy, another is very active, and another is helpless. All these types of\npsychological manifestations are causes of the entities\u2019 conditioned status in\nnature. How they are differently conditioned is explained in this section of\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. The mode of goodness is first considered. The effect of\ndeveloping the mode of goodness in the material world is that one becomes wiser\nthan those otherwise conditioned. A man in the mode of goodness is not so much\naffected by material miseries, and he has a sense of advancement in material\nknowledge. The representative type is the br\u0101hma\u1e47a, who is supposed to be\nsituated in the mode of goodness. This sense of happiness is due to\nunderstanding that, in the mode of goodness, one is more or less free from\nsinful reactions. Actually, in the Vedic literature it is said that the mode of\ngoodness means greater knowledge and a greater sense of happiness.  The difficulty here is that when a living entity is situated in the mode of\ngoodness, he becomes conditioned to feel that he is advanced in knowledge and is\nbetter than others. In this way he becomes conditioned. The best examples are\nthe scientist and philosopher: each is very proud of his knowledge, and because\nthey generally improve their living conditions, they feel a sort of material\nhappiness. This sense of advanced happiness in conditioned life makes them bound\nby the mode of goodness of material nature. As such, they are attracted toward\nworking in the mode of goodness, and, as long as they have an attraction for\nworking in that way, they have to take some type of body in the modes of nature.\nThus there is no likelihood of liberation, or of being transferred to the\nspiritual world. Repeatedly, one may become a philosopher, a scientist, or a\npoet, and, repeatedly, become entangled in the same disadvantages of birth and\ndeath. But, due to the illusion of the material energy, one thinks that that\nsort of life is pleasant.",

TRANSLATION  The mode of passion is born of unlimited desires and longings, O son of Kunt\u012b,\nand because of this one is bound to material fruitive activities.  PURPORT  The mode of passion is characterized by the attraction between man and woman.\nWoman has attraction for man, and man has attraction for woman. This is called\nthe mode of passion. And, when the mode of passion is increased, one develops\nthe hankering for material enjoyment. He wants to enjoy sense gratification. For\nsense gratification, a man in the mode of passion wants some honor in society,\nor in the nation, and he wants to have a happy family, with nice children, wife,\nand house. These are the products of the mode of passion. As long as one is\nhankering after these things, he has to work very hard.

PURPORT  In this verse the specific application of the word tu is very significant. This\nmeans that the mode of ignorance is a very peculiar qualification of the\nembodied soul. This mode of ignorance is just the opposite of the mode of\ngoodness. In the mode of goodness, by development of knowledge, one can\nunderstand what is what, but the mode of ignorance is just the opposite.\nEveryone under the spell of the mode of ignorance becomes mad, and a madman\ncannot understand what is what. Instead of making advancement, one becomes\ndegraded. The definition of the mode of ignorance is stated in the Vedic\nliterature: under the spell of ignorance, one cannot understand the thing as it\nis. For example, everyone can see that his grandfather has died, and therefore\nhe will also die; man is mortal. The children that he conceives will also die.\nSo death is sure. Still, people are madly accumulating money and working very\nhard all day and night, not caring for the eternal spirit. This is madness. In\ntheir madness, they are very reluctant to make advancement in spiritual\nunderstanding. Such people are very lazy. When they are invited to associate for\nspiritual understanding, they are not much interested. They are not even active\nlike the man who is controlled by the mode of passion. Thus another symptom of\none embedded in the mode of ignorance is that he sleeps more than is required.\nSix hours of sleep is sufficient, but a man in the mode of ignorance sleeps at\nleast ten or twelve hours a day. Such a man appears to be always dejected, and\nis addicted to intoxicants and sleeping. These are the symptoms of a person\nconditioned by the mode of ignorance.",

TRANSLATION  By acting in the mode of goodness, one becomes purified. Works done in the mode\nof passion result in distress, and actions performed in the mode of ignorance\nresult in foolishness.  PURPORT  By pious activities in the mode of goodness one is purified; therefore the\nsages, who are free from all illusion, are situated in happiness. Similarly,\nactivities in the mode of passion are simply miserable. Any activity for\nmaterial happiness is bound to be defeated. If, for example, one wants to have a\nskyscraper, so much human misery has to be undergone before a big skyscraper can\nbe built. The financier has to take much trouble to earn a mass of wealth, and\nthose who are slaving to construct the building have to render physical toil.\nThe miseries are there. Thus Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 says that in any activity performed\nunder the spell of the mode of passion, there is definitely great misery. There\nmay be a little so-called mental happiness\u2014\u201cI have this house or this money\u201d\u2014but\nthis is not actual happiness. As far as the mode of ignorance is concerned, the\nperformer is without knowledge, and therefore all his activities result in\npresent misery, and afterwards he will go on toward animal life. Animal life is\nalways miserable, although, under the spell of the illusory energy, m\u0101y\u0101, the\nanimals do not understand this. Slaughtering poor animals is also due to the\nmode of ignorance. The animal killers do not know that in the future the animal\nwill have a body suitable to kill them. That is the law of nature. In human\nsociety, if one kills a man he has to be hanged. That is the law of the state.\nBecause of ignorance, people do not perceive that there is a complete state\ncontrolled by the Supreme Lord. Every living creature is the son of the Supreme\nLord, and He does not tolerate even an ant\u2019s being killed. One has to pay for\nit. So, indulgence in animal killing for the taste of the tongue is the grossest\nkind of ignorance. A human being has no need to kill animals because God has\nsupplied so many nice things. If one indulges in meat-eating anyway, it is to be\nunderstood that he is acting in ignorance and is making his future very dark. Of\nall kinds of animal killing, the killing of cows is most vicious because the cow\ngives us all kinds of pleasure by supplying milk. Cow slaughter is an act of the\ngrossest type of ignorance. In the Vedic literature the words gobhi\u1e25\npr\u012b\u1e47ita-matsaram indicate that one who, being fully satisfied by milk, is\ndesirous of killing the cow, is in the grossest ignorance. There is also a\nprayer in the Vedic literature that states:  namo brahma\u1e47ya-dev\u0101ya go-br\u0101hma\u1e47a-hit\u0101ya ca jagaddhit\u0101ya k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47\u0101ya govind\u0101ya namo\nnama\u1e25.  \u201cMy Lord, You are the well-wisher of the cows and the br\u0101hma\u1e47as, and You are the\nwell-wisher of the entire human society and world.\u201d The purport is that special\nmention is given in that prayer for the protection of the cows and the\nbr\u0101hma\u1e47as. Br\u0101hma\u1e47as are the symbol of spiritual education, and cows are the\nsymbol of the most valuable food; these two living creatures, the br\u0101hma\u1e47as and\nthe cows, must be given all protection\u2014that is real advancement of civilization.\nIn modern human society, spiritual knowledge is neglected, and cow killing is\nencouraged. It is to be understood, then, that human society is advancing in the\nwrong direction and is clearing the path to its own condemnation. A civilization\nwhich guides the citizens to become animals in their next lives is certainly not\na human civilization. The present human civilization is, of course, grossly\nmisled by the modes of passion and ignorance. It is a very dangerous age, and\nall nations should take care to provide the easiest process, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness, to save humanity from the greatest danger.",

Through K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, society will\ndevelop the mode of goodness. When the mode of goodness is developed, people\nwill see things as they are. In the mode of ignorance, people are just like\nanimals and cannot see things clearly. In the mode of ignorance, for example,\nthey do not see that by killing one animal they are taking a chance of being\nkilled by the same animal in the next life. Because people have no education in\nactual knowledge, they become irresponsible. To stop this irresponsibility,\neducation for developing the mode of goodness of the people in general must be\nthere. When they are actually educated in the mode of goodness, they will become\nsober, in full knowledge of things as they are. Then people will be happy and\nprosperous. Even if the majority of the people aren\u2019t happy and prosperous, if a\ncertain percentage of the population develops K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and becomes\nsituated in the mode of goodness, then there is the possibility for peace and\nprosperity all over the world. Otherwise, if the world is devoted to the modes\nof passion and ignorance, there can be no peace or prosperity. In the mode of\npassion, people become greedy, and their hankering for sense enjoyment has no\nlimit. One can see that even if one has enough money and adequate arrangement\nfor sense gratification, there is neither happiness nor peace of mind. That is\nnot possible because one is situated in the mode of passion. If one wants\nhappiness at all, his money will not help him; he has to elevate himself to the\nmode of goodness by practicing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. One engaged in the mode of\npassion is not only mentally unhappy, but his profession and occupation are also\nvery troublesome. He has to devise so many plans and schemes to acquire enough\nmoney to maintain his status quo. This is all miserable. In the mode of\nignorance, people become mad.

PURPORT  In this verse the results of actions in the three modes of nature are more\nexplicitly set forth. There is an upper planetary system, consisting of the\nheavenly planets, where everyone is highly elevated. According to the degree of\ndevelopment of the mode of goodness, the living entity can be transferred to\nvarious planets in this system. The highest planet is Satyaloka, or Brahmaloka,\nwhere the prime person of this universe, Lord Brahm\u0101, resides. We have seen\nalready that we can hardly calculate the wondrous condition of life in\nBrahmaloka, but the highest condition of life, the mode of goodness, can bring\nus to this.  The mode of passion is mixed. It is in the middle, between the modes of goodness\nand ignorance. A person is not always pure, but even if he should be purely in\nthe mode of passion, he will simply remain on this earth as a king or a rich\nman. But because there are mixtures, one can also go down. People on this earth,\nin the modes of passion or ignorance, cannot forcibly approach the higher\nplanets by machine. In the mode of passion, there is also the chance of becoming\nmad in the next life.  The lowest quality, the mode of ignorance, is described here as abominable. The\nresult of developing ignorance is very, very risky. It is the lowest quality in\nmaterial nature. Beneath the human level there are eight million species of\nlife: birds, beasts, reptiles, trees, etc., and, according to the development of\nthe mode of ignorance, people are brought down to these abominable conditions.\nThe word t\u0101mas\u0101\u1e25 is very significant here. T\u0101mas\u0101\u1e25 indicates those who stay\ncontinually in the mode of ignorance without rising to a higher mode. Their\nfuture is very dark.  There is opportunity for men in the modes of ignorance and passion to be\nelevated to the mode of goodness, and that system is called K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\nBut one who does not take advantage of this opportunity certainly will continue\nin the lower modes.",

PURPORT  One can transcend all the activities of the modes of material nature simply by\nunderstanding them properly by learning from the proper souls. The real\nspiritual master is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and He is imparting this spiritual knowledge to\nArjuna. Similarly, it is from those who are fully in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness that\none has to learn this science of activities in terms of the modes of nature.\nOtherwise, one\u2019s life will be misdirected.

He is helpless, being in the grip of these modes,\nbut when he can see his real position, then he can attain to the transcendental\nplatform, having the scope for spiritual life. Actually, the living entity is\nnot the performer of different activities. He is forced to act because he is\nsituated in a particular type of body, conducted by some particular mode of\nmaterial nature. Unless one has the help of spiritual authority, he cannot\nunderstand in what position he is actually situated.

TRANSLATION  The Blessed Lord said: He who does not hate illumination, attachment and\ndelusion when they are present, nor longs for them when they disappear; who is\nseated like one unconcerned, being situated beyond these material reactions of\nthe modes of nature, who remains firm, knowing that the modes alone are active;\nwho regards alike pleasure and pain, and looks on a clod, a stone and a piece of\ngold with an equal eye; who is wise and holds praise and blame to be the same;\nwho is unchanged in honor and dishonor, who treats friend and foe alike, who has\nabandoned all fruitive undertakings\u2014such a man is said to have transcended the\nmodes of nature.  PURPORT  Arjuna submitted the three different questions, and the Lord answers them one\nafter another. In these verses, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a first indicates that a person\ntranscendentally situated neither envies anyone nor hankers for anything. When a\nliving entity stays in this material world embodied by the material body, it is\nto be understood that he is under the control of one of the three modes of\nmaterial nature. When he is actually out of the body, then he is out of the\nclutches of the material modes of nature. But as long as he is not out of the\nmaterial body, he should be neutral. He should engage himself in the devotional\nservice of the Lord so that his identity with the material body will\nautomatically be forgotten. When one is conscious of the material body, he acts\nonly for sense gratification, but when one transfers the consciousness to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a,\nsense gratification automatically stops. One does not need this material body,\nand he does not need to accept the dictations of the material body. The\nqualities of the material modes in the body will act, but as spirit soul the\nself is aloof from such activities. How does he become aloof? He does not desire\nto enjoy the body, nor does he desire to get out of it. Thus transcendentally\nsituated, the devotee becomes automatically free. He need not try to become free\nfrom the influence of the modes of material nature.  The next question concerns the dealings of a transcendentally situated person.\nThe materially situated person is affected by so-called honor and dishonor\noffered to the body, but the transcendentally situated person is not affected by\nsuch false honor and dishonor. He performs his duty in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and\ndoes not mind whether a man honors or dishonors him. He accepts things that are\nfavorable for his duty in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, otherwise he has no necessity of\nanything material, either a stone or gold. He takes everyone as his dear friend\nwho helps him in his execution of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, and he does not hate his\nso-called enemy. He is equally disposed and sees everything on an equal level\nbecause he knows perfectly well that he has nothing to do with material\nexistence. Social and political issues do not affect him because he knows the\nsituation of temporary upheavals and disturbances. He does not attempt anything\nfor his own sake. He can attempt anything for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but for his personal self\nhe does not attain anything. By such behavior one becomes actually\ntranscendentally situated.",

TRANSLATION  One who engages in full devotional service, who does not fall down in any\ncircumstance, at once transcends the modes of material nature and thus comes to\nthe level of Brahman.  PURPORT  This verse is a reply to Arjuna\u2019s third question: What is the means of attaining\nto the transcendental position? As explained before, the material world is\nacting under the spell of the modes of material nature. One should not be\ndisturbed by the activities of the modes of nature; instead of putting his\nconsciousness into such activities, he may transfer his consciousness to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nactivities. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a activities are known as bhakti-yoga\u2014always acting for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\nThis includes not only K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but His different plenary expansions such as R\u0101ma\nand N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. He has innumerable expansions. One who is engaged in the service\nof any of the forms of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or of His plenary expansions, is considered to be\ntranscendentally situated. One should also note that all the forms of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are\nfully transcendental, blissful, full of knowledge and eternal. Such\npersonalities of Godhead are omnipotent and omniscient, and they possess all\ntranscendental qualities. So, if one engages himself in the service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or\nHis plenary expansions with unfailing determination, although these modes of\nmaterial nature are very difficult to overcome, he can overcome them easily.\nThis is already explained in the Seventh Chapter. One who surrenders unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nat once surmounts the influence of the modes of material nature. To be in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness or in devotional service means to acquire the equality of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\nThe Lord says that His nature is eternal, blissful and full of knowledge, and\nthe living entities are part and parcel of the Supreme, as gold particles are\npart of a gold mine. Thus the living entity\u2019s spiritual position is as good as\ngold, as good as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in quality. The difference of individuality continues,\notherwise there is no question of bhakti-yoga. Bhakti-yoga means that the Lord\nis there, the devotee is there and the activity of exchange of love between the\nLord and the devotee is there. Therefore the individuality of two persons is\npresent in the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the individual person,\notherwise there is no meaning to bhakti-yoga. If one is not situated in the same\ntranscendental position with the Lord, one cannot serve the Supreme Lord. To be\na personal assistant to a king, one must acquire the qualifications. Thus the\nqualification is to become Brahman, or freed from all material contamination. It\nis said in the Vedic literature: brahmaiva san brahm\u0101pyeti. One can attain the\nSupreme Brahman by becoming Brahman. This means that one must qualitatively\nbecome one with Brahman. By attainment of Brahman, one does not lose his eternal\nBrahman identity as individual soul.",

TRANSLATION  And I am the basis of the impersonal Brahman, which is the constitutional\nposition of ultimate happiness, and which is immortal, imperishable and eternal.  PURPORT  The constitution of Brahman is immortality, imperishability, eternity, and\nhappiness. Brahman is the beginning of transcendental realization. Param\u0101tm\u0101,\nthe Supersoul, is the middle, the second stage in transcendental realization,\nand the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the ultimate realization of the\nAbsolute Truth. Therefore, both Param\u0101tm\u0101 and the impersonal Brahman are within\nthe Supreme Person. It is explained in the Seventh Chapter that material nature\nis the manifestation of the inferior energy of the Supreme Lord. The Lord\nimpregnates the inferior material nature with the fragments of the superior\nnature, and that is the spiritual touch in the material nature. When a living\nentity conditioned by this material nature begins the cultivation of spiritual\nknowledge, he elevates himself from the position of material existence and\ngradually rises up to the Brahman conception of the Supreme. This attainment of\nthe Brahman conception of life is the first stage in self-realization. At this\nstage the Brahman realized person is transcendental to the material position,\nbut he is not actually perfect in Brahman realization. If he wants, he can\ncontinue to stay in the Brahman position and then gradually rise up to Param\u0101tm\u0101\nrealization and then to the realization of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\nThere are many examples of this in Vedic literature. The four Kum\u0101ras were\nsituated first in the impersonal Brahman conception of truth, but then they\ngradually rose to the platform of devotional service. One who cannot elevate\nhimself beyond the impersonal conception of Brahman runs the risk of falling\ndown. In \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam it is stated that although a person may rise to the\nstage of impersonal Brahman, without going farther, with no information of the\nSupreme Person, his intelligence is not perfectly clear. Therefore, in spite of\nbeing raised to the Brahman platform, there is the chance of falling down if one\nis not engaged in the devotional service of the Lord. In the Vedic language it\nis also said: raso vai sa\u1e25; rasa\u1e41 hy ev\u0101ya\u1e41 labdhv\u0101nand\u012b bhavati. \u201cWhen one\nunderstands the Personality of God, the reservoir of pleasure, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he\nactually becomes transcendentally blissful.\u201d The Supreme Lord is full in six\nopulences, and when a devotee approaches Him, there is an exchange of these six\nopulences. The servant of the king enjoys on an almost equal level with the\nking. And so, eternal happiness, imperishable happiness, eternal life accompany\ndevotional service. Therefore, realization of Brahman, or eternity, or\nimperishability is included in devotional service. This is already possessed by\na person who is engaged in devotional service.  The living entity, although Brahman by nature, has the desire to lord it over\nthe material world, and due to this he falls down. In his constitutional\nposition, a living entity is above the three modes of material nature, but\nassociation with material nature entangles him in the different modes of\nmaterial nature, goodness, passion and ignorance. Due to the association of\nthese three modes, his desire to dominate the material world is there. By\nengagement in devotional service in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, he is immediately\nsituated in the transcendental position, and his unlawful desire to control\nmaterial nature is removed. Therefore the process of devotional service\nbeginning with hearing, chanting, remembering\u2014the prescribed nine methods for\nrealizing devotional service\u2014should be practiced in the association of devotees.\nGradually, by such association, by the influence of the spiritual master, one\u2019s\nmaterial desire to dominate is removed, and one becomes firmly situated in the\nLord\u2019s transcendental loving service. This method is prescribed from the\ntwenty-second to the last verse of this chapter. Devotional service to the Lord\nis very simple: one should always engage in the service of the Lord, should eat\nthe remnants of foodstuffs offered to the Deity, smell the flowers offered to\nthe lotus feet of the Lord, see the places where the Lord had His transcendental\npastimes, read of the different activities of the Lord, His reciprocation of\nlove with His devotees, chant always the transcendental vibration Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47na,\nHare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare,\nand observe the fasting days commemorating the appearances and disappearances of\nthe Lord and His devotees. By following such a process one becomes completely\ndetached from all material activities. One who can thus situate himself in the\nbrahmajyoti is equal to the Supreme Personality of Godhead in quality.",

One who knows this tree is\nthe knower of the Vedas.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nAfter the discussion of the importance of bhakti-yoga, one may question, \u201cWhat\nabout the Vedas?\u201d It is explained in this chapter that the purpose of Vedic\nstudy is to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore one who is in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, who\nis engaged in devotional service, already knows the Vedas.\n\n\nThe entanglement of this material world is compared here to a banyan tree. For\none who is engaged in fruitive activities, there is no end to the banyan tree.\nHe wanders from one branch to another, to another, to another. The tree of this\nmaterial world has no end, and for one who is attached to this tree, there is no\npossibility of liberation. The Vedic hymns, meant for elevating oneself, are\ncalled the leaves of this tree. This tree\u2019s roots grow upward because they begin\nfrom where Brahm\u0101 is located, the topmost planet of this universe. If one can\nunderstand this indestructible tree of illusion, then one can get out of it.\n\n\nThis process of extrication should be understood. In the previous chapters it\nhas been explained that there are many processes by which to get out of the\nmaterial entanglement. And, up to the Thirteenth Chapter, we have seen that\ndevotional service to the Supreme Lord is the best way. Now, the basic principle\nof devotional service is detachment from material activities and attachment to\nthe transcendental service of the Lord. The process of breaking attachment to\nthe material world is discussed in the beginning of this chapter. The root of\nthis material existence grows upward. This means that it begins from the total\nmaterial substance, from the topmost planet of the universe. From there, the\nwhole universe is expanded, with so many branches, representing the various\nplanetary systems. The fruits represent the results of the living entities\u2019\nactivities, namely, religion, economic development, sense gratification and\nliberation.\n\n\nNow, there is no ready experience in this world of a tree situated with its\nbranches down and its roots upward, but there is such a thing. That tree can be\nfound beside a reservoir of water. We can see that the trees on the bank reflect\nupon the water with their branches down and roots up. In other words, the tree\nof this material world is only a reflection of the real tree of the spiritual\nworld. This reflection of the spiritual world is situated on desire, just as the\ntree\u2019s reflection is situated on water. Desire is the cause of things\u2019 being\nsituated in this reflected material light. One who wants to get out of this\nmaterial existence must know this tree thoroughly through analytical study. Then\nhe can cut off his relationship with it.\n\n\nThis tree, being the reflection of the real tree, is an exact replica.\nEverything is there in the spiritual world. The impersonalists take Brahm\u0101 to be\nthe root of this material tree, and from the root, according to s\u0101\u1e45khya\nphilosophy, come prak\u1e5bti, puru\u1e63a, then the three gu\u1e47as, then the five gross\nelements (pa\u00f1ca-mah\u0101bh\u016bta), then the ten senses (da\u015bendriya), mind, etc. In this\nway they divide up the whole material world. If Brahm\u0101 is the center of all\nmanifestations, then this material world is a manifestation of the center by 180\ndegrees, and the other 180 degrees constitute the spiritual world. The material\nworld is the perverted reflection, so the spiritual world must have the same\nvariegatedness, but in reality. The prak\u1e5bti is the external energy of the\nSupreme Lord, and the puru\u1e63a is the Supreme Lord Himself, and that is explained\nin Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Since this manifestation is material, it is temporary. A\nreflection is temporary, for it is sometimes seen and sometimes not seen. But\nthe origin from whence the reflection is reflected is eternal. The material\nreflection of the real tree has to be cut off. When it is said that a person\nknows the Vedas, it is assumed that he knows how to cut off attachment to this\nmaterial world. If one knows that process, he actually knows the Vedas. One who\nis attracted by the ritualistic formulas of the Vedas is attracted by the\nbeautiful green leaves of the tree. He does not exactly know the purpose of the\nVedas. The purpose of the Vedas, as disclosed by the Personality of Godhead\nHimself, is to cut down this reflected tree and attain the real tree of the\nspiritual world.\n\n\n15.2\n\n\nadha\u015b cordhva\u1e41 pras\u1e5bt\u0101s tasya \u015b\u0101kh\u0101\n\n\ngu\u1e47a-prav\u1e5bddh\u0101 vi\u1e63aya-prav\u0101l\u0101\u1e25\n\n\nadha\u015b ca m\u016bl\u0101ny anusantat\u0101ni\n\n\nkarm\u0101nubandh\u012bni manu\u1e63ya-loke\n\n\nadha\u1e25\u2014downward; ca\u2014and; \u016brdhvam\u2014upward; pras\u1e5bt\u0101\u1e25\u2014extended; tasya\u2014its;\n\u015b\u0101kh\u0101\u1e25\u2014branches; gu\u1e47a\u2014modes of material nature; prav\u1e5bddh\u0101\u1e25\u2014developed;\nvi\u1e63aya\u2014sense objects; prav\u0101l\u0101\u1e25\u2014twigs; adha\u1e25\u2014downward; ca\u2014and; m\u016bl\u0101ni\u2014roots;\nanusantat\u0101ni\u2014extended; karma\u2014according to work; anubandh\u012bni\u2014bound;\nmanu\u1e63ya-loke\u2014in the world of human society.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThe branches of this tree extend downward and upward, nourished by the three\nmodes of material nature. The twigs are the objects of the senses. This tree\nalso has roots going down, and these are bound to the fruitive actions of human\nsociety.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe description of the banyan tree is further explained here. Its branches are\nspread in all directions. In the lower parts, there are variegated\nmanifestations of living entities, such as human beings, animals, horses, cows,\ndogs, cats, etc. These are situated on the lower parts of the branches, whereas\non the upper parts are higher forms of living entities: the demigods, Gandharvas\n(fairies), and many other higher species of life. As a tree is nourished by\nwater, so this tree is nourished by the three modes of material nature.\nSometimes we find that a tract of land is barren for want of sufficient water,\nand sometimes a tract is very green; similarly, where the modes of material\nnature are proportionately greater in quantity, the different species of life\nare manifested in that proportion.\n\n\nThe twigs of the tree are considered to be the sense objects. By development of\nthe different modes of nature, we develop different senses, and, by the senses,\nwe enjoy different varieties of sense objects. The source of the senses\u2014the\nears, the nose, eyes, etc.\u2014is considered to be the upper twigs, tuned to the\nenjoyment of different sense objects. The leaves are sound, form, touch\u2014the\nsense objects. The roots, which are subsidiary, are the by-products of different\nvarieties of suffering and sense enjoyment. Thus we develop attachment and\naversion. The tendencies toward piety and impiety are considered to be the\nsecondary roots, spreading in all directions. The real root is from Brahmaloka,\nand the other roots are in the human planetary systems. After one enjoys the\nresults of virtuous activities in the upper planetary systems, he comes down to\nthis earth and renews his karma or fruitive activities for promotion. This\nplanet of human beings is considered the field of activities.\n\n\n15.3-4\n\n\nna r\u016bpam asyeha tathopalabhyate\n\n\nn\u0101nto na c\u0101dir na ca samprati\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101\n\n\na\u015bvattham ena\u1e41 su-vir\u016b\u1e0dha-m\u016blam\n\n\nasa\u1e45ga-\u015bastre\u1e47a d\u1e5b\u1e0dhena chittv\u0101\n\n\ntata\u1e25 pada\u1e41 tat parim\u0101rgitavya\u1e41\n\n\nyasmin gat\u0101 na nivartanti bh\u016bya\u1e25\n\n\ntam eva c\u0101dya\u1e41 puru\u1e63a\u1e41 prapadye\n\n\nyata\u1e25 prav\u1e5btti\u1e25 pras\u1e5bt\u0101 pur\u0101\u1e47\u012b\n\n\nna\u2014not; r\u016bpam\u2014form; asya\u2014of this tree; iha\u2014in this; tath\u0101\u2014also; upalabhyate\u2014can\nbe perceived; na\u2014never; anta\u1e25\u2014end; na\u2014never; ca\u2014also; \u0101di\u1e25\u2014beginning; na\u2014never;\nca\u2014also; samprati\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101\u2014the foundation; a\u015bvattham\u2014banyan tree; enam\u2014this;\nsuvir\u016b\u1e0dha\u2014strongly; m\u016blam\u2014rooted; asa\u1e45ga-\u015bastre\u1e47a\u2014by the weapon of detachment;\nd\u1e5b\u1e0dhena\u2014strong; chittv\u0101\u2014by cutting; tata\u1e25\u2014thereafter; padam\u2014situation; tat\u2014that;\nparim\u0101rgitavyam\u2014has to be searched out; yasmin\u2014where; gat\u0101\u1e25\u2014going; na\u2014never;\nnivartanti\u2014comes back; bh\u016bya\u1e25\u2014again; tam\u2014to him; eva\u2014certainly; ca\u2014also;\n\u0101dyam\u2014original; puru\u1e63am\u2014the Personality of Godhead; prapadye\u2014surrender;\nyata\u1e25\u2014from whom; prav\u1e5btti\u1e25\u2014beginning; pras\u1e5bt\u0101\u2014extension; pur\u0101\u1e47\u012b\u2014very old.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThe real form of this tree cannot be perceived in this world. No one can\nunderstand where it ends, where it begins, or where its foundation is. But with\ndetermination one must cut down this tree with the weapon of detachment. So\ndoing, one must seek that place from which, having once gone, one never returns,\nand there surrender to that Supreme Personality of Godhead from whom everything\nhas begun and in whom everything is abiding since time immemorial.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nIt is now clearly stated that the real form of this banyan tree cannot be\nunderstood in this material world. Since the root is upwards, the extension of\nthe real tree is at the other end. No one can see how far the tree extends, nor\ncan one see the beginning of this tree. Yet one has to find out the cause. \u201cI am\nthe son of my father, my father is the son of such and such a person, etc.\u201d By\nsearching in this way, one comes to Brahm\u0101, who is generated by the\nGarbhodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Finally, in this way, when one reaches to the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead, that is the end of research work. One has to search out\nthat origin of this tree, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, through the\nassociation of persons who are in the knowledge of that Supreme Personality of\nGodhead. Then by understanding one becomes gradually detached from this false\nreflection of reality, and by knowledge one can cut off the connection and\nactually become situated in the real tree.\n\n\nThe word asa\u1e45ga is very important in this connection because the attachment for\nsense enjoyment and lording it over the material nature is very strong.\nTherefore one must learn detachment by discussion of spiritual science based on\nauthoritative scriptures, and one must hear from persons who are actually in\nknowledge. As a result of such discussion in the association of devotees, one\ncomes to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Then the first thing one must do is\nsurrender to Him. The description of that place whence going no one returns to\nthis false reflected tree is given here. The Supreme Personality of Godhead,\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is the original root from whom everything has emanated. To gain favor of\nthat Personality of Godhead, one has only to surrender, and this is a result of\nperforming devotional service by hearing, chanting, etc. He is the cause of this\nextension of this material world. This is already explained by the Lord Himself:\naha\u1e41 sarvasya prabhava\u1e25. \u201cI am the origin of everything.\u201d\n\n\nTherefore to get out of the entanglement of this strong banyan tree of material\nlife, one must surrender to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. As soon as one surrenders unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he\nbecomes detached automatically from this material extension.\n\n\n15.5\n\n\nnirm\u0101na-moh\u0101 jita-sa\u1e45ga-do\u1e63\u0101\n\n\nadhy\u0101tma-nity\u0101 viniv\u1e5btta-k\u0101m\u0101\u1e25\n\n\ndvandvair vimukt\u0101\u1e25 sukha-du\u1e25kha-sa\u1e41j\u00f1air\n\n\ngacchanty am\u016b\u1e0dh\u0101\u1e25 padam avyaya\u1e41 tat\n\n\nnir\u2014without; m\u0101na\u2014respect; moh\u0101\u1e25\u2014illusion; jita\u2014having conquered;\nsa\u1e45ga\u2014association; do\u1e63\u0101\u1e25\u2014faulty; adhy\u0101tma\u2014spiritual; nity\u0101\u1e25\u2014eternity;\nviniv\u1e5btta\u2014associated; k\u0101m\u0101\u1e25\u2014lusts; dvandvai\u1e25\u2014with duality; vimukt\u0101\u1e25\u2014liberated;\nsukha-du\u1e25kha\u2014happiness and distress; sa\u1e41j\u00f1ai\u1e25\u2014named; gacchanti\u2014attains;\nam\u016b\u1e0dh\u0101\u1e25\u2014unbewildered; padam\u2014situation; avyayam\u2014eternal; tat\u2014that.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nOne who is free from illusion, false prestige, and false association, who\nunderstands the eternal, who is done with material lust and is freed from the\nduality of happiness and distress, and who knows how to surrender unto the\nSupreme Person, attains to that eternal kingdom.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe surrendering process is described here very nicely. The first qualification\nis that one should not be deluded by pride. Because the conditioned soul is\npuffed up, thinking himself the lord of material nature, it is very difficult\nfor him to surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One should know by\nthe cultivation of real knowledge that he is not lord of material nature; the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead is the Lord. When one is free from delusion\ncaused by pride, he can begin the process of surrender. For one who is always\nexpecting some honor in this material world, it is not possible to surrender to\nthe Supreme Person. Pride is due to illusion, for although one comes here, stays\nfor a brief time and then goes away, he has the foolish notion that he is the\nlord of the world. He thus makes all things complicated, and he is always in\ntrouble. The whole world moves under this impression. People are considering\nthat the land, this earth, belongs to human society, and they have divided the\nland under the false impression that they are the proprietors. One has to get\nout of this false notion that human society is the proprietor of this world.\nWhen one is freed from such a false notion, he becomes free from all the false\nassociations caused by familial, social, and national affections. These fake\nassociations bind one to this material world. After this stage, one has to\ndevelop spiritual knowledge. One has to cultivate knowledge of what is actually\nhis own and what is actually not his own. And, when one has an understanding of\nthings as they are, he becomes free from all dual conceptions such as happiness\nand distress, pleasure and pain. He becomes full in knowledge; then it is\npossible for him to surrender to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\n\n\n15.6\n\n\nna tad bh\u0101sayate s\u016bryo\n\n\nna \u015ba\u015b\u0101\u1e45ko na p\u0101vaka\u1e25\n\n\nyad gatv\u0101 na nivartante\n\n\ntad dh\u0101ma parama\u1e41 mama\n\n\nna\u2014not; tat\u2014that; bh\u0101sayate\u2014illuminates; s\u016brya\u1e25\u2014sun; na\u2014nor; \u015ba\u015b\u0101\u1e45ka\u1e25\u2014the moon;\nna\u2014nor; p\u0101vaka\u1e25\u2014fire, electricity; yat\u2014where; gatv\u0101\u2014going; na\u2014never;\nnivartante\u2014comes back; tat dh\u0101ma\u2014that abode; paramam\u2014supreme; mama\u2014My.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThat abode of Mine is not illumined by the sun or moon, nor by electricity. One\nwho reaches it never returns to this material world.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe spiritual world, the abode of the Supreme Personality of Godhead,\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2014which is known as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aloka, Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana\u2014is described here. In the\nspiritual sky there is no need of sunshine, moonshine, fire or electricity,\nbecause all the planets are self-luminous. We have only one planet in this\nuniverse, the sun, which is self-luminous, but all the planets in the spiritual\nsky are self-luminous. The shining effulgence of all those planets (called\nVaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhas) constitutes the shining sky known as the brahmajyoti. Actually, the\neffulgence is emanating from the planet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. Part of that\nshining effulgence is covered by the mahat-tattva, the material world. Other\nthan this, the major portion of that shining sky is full of spiritual planets,\nwhich are called Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhas, chief of which is Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana.\n\n\nAs long as a living entity is in this dark material world, he is in conditional\nlife, but as soon as he reaches the spiritual sky, by cutting through the false,\nperverted tree of this material world, he becomes liberated. Then there is no\nchance of his coming back here. In his conditional life, the living entity\nconsiders himself to be the lord of this material world, but in his liberated\nstate he enters into the spiritual kingdom and becomes the associate of the\nSupreme Lord. There he enjoys eternal bliss, eternal life, and full knowledge.\n\n\nOne should be captivated by this information. He should desire to transfer\nhimself to that eternal world and extricate himself from this false reflection\nof reality. For one who is too much attached to this material world, it is very\ndifficult to cut that attachment, but if he takes to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, there\nis a chance of gradually becoming detached. One has to associate himself with\ndevotees, those who are in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. One should search out a society\ndedicated to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and learn how to discharge devotional service.\nIn this way he can cut off his attachment to the material world. One cannot\nbecome detached from the attraction of the material world simply by dressing\nhimself in saffron cloth. He must become attached to the devotional service of\nthe Lord. Therefore one should take it very seriously that devotional service as\ndescribed in the Twelfth Chapter is the only way to get out of this false\nrepresentation of the real tree. In Chapter Fourteen the contamination of all\nkinds of processes by material nature is described. Only devotional service is\ndescribed as purely transcendental.\n\n\nThe words parama\u1e41 mama are very important here. Actually every nook and corner\nis the property of the Supreme Lord, but the spiritual world is paramam, full of\nsix opulences. In the Upani\u1e63ads it is also confirmed that in the spiritual world\nthere is no need of sunshine or moonshine, for the whole spiritual sky is\nilluminated by the internal potency of the Supreme Lord. That supreme abode can\nbe achieved only by surrender and by no other means.\n\n\n15.7\n\n\nmamaiv\u0101\u1e41\u015bo j\u012bva-loke\n\n\nj\u012bva-bh\u016bta\u1e25 san\u0101tana\u1e25\n\n\nmana\u1e25-\u1e63a\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101n\u012bndriy\u0101\u1e47i\n\n\nprak\u1e5bti-sth\u0101ni kar\u1e63ati\n\n\nmama\u2014My; eva\u2014certainly; a\u1e41\u015ba\u1e25\u2014fragmental particles; j\u012bva-loke\u2014world of\nconditional life; j\u012bva-bh\u016bta\u1e25\u2014the conditioned living entities;\nsan\u0101tana\u1e25\u2014eternal; mana\u1e25\u2014mind; \u1e63a\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101ni\u2014six; indriy\u0101\u1e47i\u2014senses; prak\u1e5bti\u2014material\nnature; sth\u0101ni\u2014situated; kar\u1e63ati\u2014struggling hard.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThe living entities in this conditioned world are My eternal, fragmental parts.\nDue to conditioned life, they are struggling very hard with the six senses,\nwhich include the mind.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nIn this verse the identity of the living being is clearly given. The living\nentity is the fragmental part and parcel of the Supreme Lord\u2014eternally. It is\nnot that he assumes individuality in his conditional life and in his liberated\nstate becomes one with the Supreme Lord. He is eternally fragmented. It is\nclearly said, san\u0101tana\u1e25. According to the Vedic version, the Supreme Lord\nmanifests and expands Himself in innumerable expansions, of which the primary\nexpansions are called Vi\u1e63\u1e47u-tattva, and the secondary expansions are called the\nliving entities. In other words, the Vi\u1e63\u1e47u-tattva is the personal expansion, and\nthe living entities are separated expansions. By His personal expansion, He is\nmanifested in various forms like Lord R\u0101ma, N\u1e5bsi\u1e41hadeva, Vi\u1e63\u1e47um\u016brti and all the\npredominating Deities in the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets. The separated expansions, the\nliving entities, are eternally servitors. The personal expansions of the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead, the individual identities of the Godhead, are always\npresent. Similarly, the separated expansions of living entities have their\nidentities. As fragmental parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord, the living\nentities have also fragmental qualities, of which independence is one. Every\nliving entity has an individual soul, his personal individuality and a minute\nform of independence. By misuse of that independence, one becomes a conditioned\nsoul, and by proper use of independence he is always liberated. In either case,\nhe is qualititatively eternal, as the Supreme Lord is. In his liberated state he\nis freed from this material condition, and he is under the engagement of\ntranscendental service unto the Lord; in his conditioned life he is dominated by\nthe material modes of nature, and he forgets the transcendental loving service\nof the Lord. As a result, he has to struggle very hard to maintain his existence\nin the material world.\n\n\nThe living entities, not only the human beings and the cats and dogs, but even\nthe greater controllers of the material world\u2014Brahm\u0101, Lord \u015aiva, and even\nVi\u1e63\u1e47u\u2014are all parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord. They are all eternal, not\ntemporary manifestations. The word kar\u1e63ati (struggling or grappling hard) is\nvery significant. The conditioned soul is bound up, as though shackled by iron\nchains. He is bound up by the false ego, and the mind is the chief agent which\nis driving him in this material existence. When the mind is in the mode of\ngoodness, his activities are good; when the mind is in the mode of passion, his\nactivities are troublesome; and when the mind is in the mode of ignorance, he\ntravels in the lower species of life. It is clear, however, in this verse, that\nthe conditioned soul is covered by the material body, with the mind and the\nsenses, and when he is liberated this material covering perishes, but his\nspiritual body manifests in its individual capacity. The following information\nis there in the M\u0101dhyandi-n\u0101yana-\u015bruti: sa v\u0101 e\u1e63a brahma-ni\u1e63\u1e6dha ida\u1e41 sar\u012bra\u1e41\nmarttyam atis\u1e5bjya brahm\u0101bhisampadya brahma\u1e47\u0101 pa\u015byati brahma\u1e47\u0101 \u015b\u1e5bnoti\nbrahma\u1e47aiveda\u1e41 sarvam anubhavati. It is stated here that when a living entity\ngives up this material embodiment and enters into the spiritual world, he\nrevives his spiritual body, and in his spiritual body he can see the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead face to face. He can hear and speak to Him face to face,\nand he can understand the Supreme Personality as He is. In sm\u1e5bti also it is\nunderstood that in the spiritual planets everyone lives in bodies featured like\nthe Supreme Personality of Godhead\u2019s. As far as bodily construction is\nconcerned, there is no difference between the part and parcel living entities\nand the expansions of Vi\u1e63\u1e47um\u016brti. In other words, at liberation the living\nentity gets a spiritual body by the grace of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\n\n\nThe word mamaiv\u0101\u1e41\u015ba\u1e25 (fragmental parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord) is also\nvery significant. The fragmental portion of the Supreme Lord is not like some\nmaterial broken part. We have already understood in the Second Chapter that the\nspirit cannot be cut into pieces. This fragment is not materially conceived. It\nis not like matter which can be cut into pieces and joined together again. That\nconception is not applicable here because the Sanskrit word san\u0101tana (eternal)\nis used. The fragmental portion is eternal. It is also stated in the beginning\nof the Second Chapter that (dehino \u2019smin yath\u0101) in each and every individual\nbody, the fragmental portion of the Supreme Lord is present. That fragmental\nportion, when liberated from the bodily entanglement, revives its original\nspiritual body in the spiritual sky in a spiritual planet and enjoys association\nwith the Supreme Lord. It is, however, understood here that the living entity,\nbeing the fragmental part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, is qualitatively one,\njust as the parts and parcels of gold are also gold.\n\n\n15.8\n\n\n\u015bar\u012bra\u1e41 yad av\u0101pnoti\n\n\nyac c\u0101py utkr\u0101mat\u012b\u015bvara\u1e25\n\n\ng\u1e5bh\u012btvait\u0101ni sa\u1e41y\u0101ti\n\n\nv\u0101yur gandh\u0101n iv\u0101\u015bay\u0101t\n\n\n\u015bar\u012bram\u2014body; yat\u2014as much as; av\u0101pnoti\u2014gets; yat\u2014that which; ca\u2014also;\napi\u2014virtually; utkr\u0101mati\u2014gives up; \u012b\u015bvara\u1e25\u2014the lord of the body; g\u1e5bh\u012btv\u0101\u2014taking;\net\u0101ni\u2014all these; sa\u1e41y\u0101ti\u2014goes away; v\u0101yu\u1e25\u2014air; gandh\u0101n\u2014smell; iva\u2014like;\n\u0101\u015bay\u0101t\u2014from the flower.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThe living entity in the material world carries his different conceptions of\nlife from one body to another as the air carries aromas.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nHere the living entity is described as \u012b\u015bvara, the controller of his own body.\nIf he likes, he can change his body to a higher grade, and if he likes he can\nmove to a lower class. Minute independence is there. The change his body\nundergoes depends upon him. At the time of death, the consciousness he has\ncreated will carry him on to the next type of body. If he has made his\nconsciousness like that of a cat or dog, he is sure to change to a cat\u2019s or\ndog\u2019s body. And, if he has fixed his consciousness on godly qualities, he will\nchange into the form of a demigod. And, if he is in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, he will\nbe transferred to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aloka in the spiritual world and will associate with\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. It is a false claim that after the annihilation of this body everything\nis finished. The individual soul is transmigrating from one body to another, and\nhis present body and present activities are the background of his next body. One\ngets a different body according to karma, and he has to quit this body in due\ncourse. It is stated here that the subtle body, which carries the conception of\nthe next body, develops another body in the next life. This process of\ntransmigrating from one body to another and struggling while in the body is\ncalled kar\u1e63ati or struggle for existence.\n\n\n15.9\n\n\n\u015brotra\u1e41 cak\u1e63u\u1e25 spar\u015bana\u1e41 ca\n\n\nrasana\u1e41 ghr\u0101\u1e47am eva ca\n\n\nadhi\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101ya mana\u015b c\u0101ya\u1e41\n\n\nvi\u1e63ay\u0101n upasevate\n\n\n\u015brotram\u2014ears; cak\u1e63u\u1e25\u2014eyes; spar\u015banam\u2014touch; ca\u2014also; rasanam\u2014tongue;\nghr\u0101\u1e47am\u2014smelling power; eva\u2014also; ca\u2014and; adhi\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101ya\u2014being situated; mana\u1e25\u2014mind;\nca\u2014also; ayam\u2014this; vi\u1e63ay\u0101n\u2014sense objects; upasevate\u2014enjoys.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThe living entity, thus taking another gross body, obtains a certain type of\near, tongue, and nose and sense of touch, which are grouped about the mind. He\nthus enjoys a particular set of sense objects.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nIn other words, if the living entity adulterates his consciousness with the\nqualities of cats and dogs, in his next life he gets a cat or dog body and\nenjoys. Consciousness is originally pure, like water. But if we mix water with a\ncertain color, it changes. Similarly, consciousness is pure, for the spirit soul\nis pure. But consciousness is changed according to the association of the\nmaterial qualities. Real consciousness is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. When, therefore,\none is situated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, he is in his pure life. But if his\nconsciousness is adulterated by some type of material mentality, in the next\nlife he gets a corresponding body. He does not necessarily get a human body\nagain; he can get the body of a cat, dog, hog, demigod or one of many other\nforms, for there are 8,400,000 species.\n\n\n15.10\n\n\nutkr\u0101manta\u1e41 sthita\u1e41 v\u0101pi\n\n\nbhu\u00f1j\u0101na\u1e41 v\u0101 gu\u1e47\u0101nvitam\n\n\nvim\u016b\u1e0dh\u0101 n\u0101nupa\u015byanti\n\n\npa\u015byanti j\u00f1\u0101na-cak\u1e63u\u1e63a\u1e25\n\n\nutkr\u0101mantam\u2014quitting the body; sthitam\u2014situated in the body; v\u0101pi\u2014either;\nbhu\u00f1j\u0101nam\u2014enjoying; v\u0101\u2014or; gu\u1e47a-anvitam\u2014under the spell of the modes of material\nnature; vim\u016b\u1e0dh\u0101\u1e25\u2014foolish persons; na\u2014never; anupa\u015byanti\u2014can see; pa\u015byanti\u2014one\ncan see; j\u00f1\u0101na-cak\u1e63u\u1e63a\u1e25\u2014one who has the eyes of knowledge.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThe foolish cannot understand how a living entity can quit his body, nor can\nthey understand what sort of body he enjoys under the spell of the modes of\nnature. But one whose eyes are trained in knowledge can see all this.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe word j\u00f1\u0101na-cak\u1e63u\u1e63a\u1e25 is very significant. Without knowledge, one cannot\nunderstand how a living entity leaves his present body, nor what form of body he\nis going to take in the next life, nor even why he is living in a particular\ntype of body. This requires a great amount of knowledge understood from\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and similar literatures heard from a bona fide spiritual master.\nOne who is trained to perceive all these things is fortunate. Every living\nentity is quitting his body under certain circumstances; he is living under\ncertain circumstances and enjoying under certain circumstances under the spell\nof material nature. As a result, he is suffering different kinds of happiness\nand distress, under the illusion of sense enjoyment. Persons who are\neverlastingly fooled by lust and desire lose all power of understanding their\nchange of body and their stay in a particular body. They cannot comprehend it.\nThose who have developed spiritual knowledge, however, can see that the spirit\nis different from the body and is changing its body and enjoying in different\nways. A person in such knowledge can understand how the conditioned living\nentity is suffering in this material existence. Therefore those who are highly\ndeveloped in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness try their best to give this knowledge to the\npeople in general, for their conditional life is very much troublesome. They\nshould come out of it and be K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious and liberate themselves to transfer\nto the spiritual world.\n\n\n15.11\n\n\nyatanto yogina\u015b caina\u1e41\n\n\npa\u015byanty \u0101tmany avasthitam\n\n\nyatanto \u2019py ak\u1e5bt\u0101tm\u0101no\n\n\nnaina\u1e41 pa\u015byanty acetasa\u1e25\n\n\nyatanta\u1e25\u2014endeavoring; yogina\u1e25\u2014transcendentalists; ca\u2014also; enam\u2014this;\npa\u015byanti\u2014can see; \u0101tmani\u2014in the self; avasthitam\u2014situated; yatanta\u1e25\u2014although\nendeavoring; api\u2014although; ak\u1e5bta-\u0101tm\u0101na\u1e25\u2014without self-realization; na\u2014does not;\nenam\u2014this; pa\u015byanti\u2014can see; acetasa\u1e25\u2014undeveloped mind.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThe endeavoring transcendentalist, who is situated in self-realization, can see\nall this clearly.

The word yogina\u1e25 is significant in this\nconnection. In the present day there are many so-called yog\u012bs, and there are\nmany so-called associations of yog\u012bs, but they are actually blind in the matter\nof self-realization. They are simply addicted to some sort of gymnastic exercise\nand are satisfied if the body is well-built and healthy. They have no other\ninformation. They are called yatanto \u2019py ak\u1e5bt\u0101tm\u0101na\u1e25. Even though they are\nendeavoring in a so-called yoga system, they are not self-realized. Such people\ncannot understand the process of the transmigration of the soul. Only those who\nare actually in the yoga system and have realized the self, the world, and the\nSupreme Lord, in other words, the bhakti-yog\u012bs, those engaged in pure devotional\nservice in Krs\u1e47a consciousness, can understand how things are taking place.\n\n\n15.12\n\n\nyad \u0101ditya-gata\u1e41 tejo\n\n\njagad bh\u0101sayate \u2019khilam\n\n\nyac candramasi yac c\u0101gnau\n\n\ntat tejo viddhi m\u0101makam\n\n\nyat\u2014that which; \u0101ditya-gatam\u2014in the sunshine; teja\u1e25\u2014splendor; jagat\u2014the whole\nworld; bh\u0101sayate\u2014illuminates; akhilam\u2014entirely; yat\u2014that which; candramasi\u2014in\nthe moon; yat\u2014that which; ca\u2014also; agnau\u2014in the fire; tat\u2014that; teja\u1e25\u2014splendor;\nviddhi\u2014understand; m\u0101makam\u2014from Me.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThe splendor of the sun, which dissipates the darkness of this whole world,\ncomes from Me. And the splendor of the moon and the splendor of fire are also\nfrom Me.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe unintelligent cannot understand how things are taking place. The beginning\nof knowledge can be established by understanding what the Lord explains here.\nEveryone sees the sun, moon, fire and electricity. One should simply try to\nunderstand that the splendor of the sun, the splendor of the moon, and the\nsplendor of electricity or fire are coming from the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead. In such a conception of life, the beginning of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness,\nlies a great deal of advancement for the conditioned soul in this material\nworld. The living entities are essentially the parts and parcels of the Supreme\nLord, and He is giving herewith the hint how they can come back to Godhead, back\nto home. From this verse we can understand that the sun is illuminating the\nwhole solar system. There are different universes and solar systems, and there\nare different suns, moons and planets also. Sunlight is due to the spiritual\neffulgence in the spiritual sky of the Supreme Lord. With the rise of the sun,\nthe activities of human beings are set up. They set fire to prepare their\nfoodstuff; they set fire to start the factories, etc. So many things are done\nwith the help of fire. Therefore sunrise, fire and moonlight are so pleasing to\nthe living entities. Without their help no living entity can live. So if one can\nunderstand that the light and splendor of the sun, moon and fire are emanating\nfrom the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, then one\u2019s K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness\nwill begin. By the moonshine, all the vegetables are nourished. The moonshine is\nso pleasing that people can easily understand that they are living by the mercy\nof the Supreme Personality of Godhead K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Without His mercy there cannot be\nsun, without His mercy there cannot be moon, and without His mercy there cannot\nbe fire, and without the help of sun, moon and fire, no one can live. These are\nsome thoughts to provoke K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness in the conditioned soul.\n\n\n15.13\n\n\ng\u0101m \u0101vi\u015bya ca bh\u016bt\u0101ni\n\n\ndh\u0101ray\u0101my aham ojas\u0101\n\n\npu\u1e63\u1e47\u0101mi cau\u1e63adh\u012b\u1e25 sarv\u0101\u1e25\n\n\nsomo bh\u016btv\u0101 ras\u0101tmaka\u1e25\n\n\ng\u0101m\u2014the planets; \u0101vi\u015bya\u2014entering; ca\u2014also; bh\u016bt\u0101ni\u2014living entities;\ndh\u0101ray\u0101mi\u2014sustaining; aham\u2014I; ojas\u0101\u2014by My energy; pu\u1e63\u1e47\u0101mi\u2014nourishing; ca\u2014and;\nau\u1e63adh\u012b\u1e25\u2014all vegetables; sarv\u0101\u1e25\u2014all; soma\u1e25\u2014the moon; bh\u016btv\u0101\u2014becoming;\nrasa-\u0101tmaka\u1e25\u2014supplying the juice.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nI enter into each planet, and by My energy they stay in orbit. I become the moon\nand thereby supply the juice of life to all vegetables.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nIt is understood that all the planets are floating in the air only by the energy\nof the Lord. The Lord enters into every atom, every planet, and every living\nbeing. That is discussed in the Brahm\u0101-sa\u1e41hit\u0101. It is said there that one\nplenary portion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Param\u0101tm\u0101, enters into\nthe planets, the universe, the living entity, and even into the atom. So due to\nHis entrance, everything is appropriately manifested. When the spirit soul is\nthere, a living man can float on the water, but when the living spark is out of\nthe body and the body is dead, it sinks. Of course when it is decomposed it\nfloats just like straw and other things, but as soon as the man is dead, he at\nonce sinks in the water. Similarly, all these planets are floating in space, and\nthis is due to the entrance of the supreme energy of the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead. His energy is sustaining each planet, just like a handful of dust. If\nsomeone holds a handful of dust, there is no possibility of the dust falling,\nbut if one throws it in the air, it will fall down. Similarly, these planets,\nwhich are floating in air, are actually held in the fist of the universal form\nof the Supreme Lord. By His strength and energy, all moving and unmoving things\nstay in their place. It is said that because of the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead, the sun is shining and the planets are steadily moving. Were it not for\nHim, all the planets would scatter, like dust in air, and perish. Similarly, it\nis due to the Supreme Personality of Godhead that the moon nourishes all\nvegetables. Due to the moon\u2019s influence, the vegetables become delicious.\nWithout the moonshine, the vegetables can neither grow nor taste succulent.\nHuman society is working, living comfortably and enjoying food due to the supply\nfrom the Supreme Lord. Otherwise, mankind could not survive. The word ras\u0101tmaka\u1e25\nis very significant. Everything becomes palatable by the agency of the Supreme\nLord through the influence of the moon.\n\n\n15.14\n\n\naha\u1e41 vai\u015bv\u0101naro bh\u016btv\u0101\n\n\npr\u0101\u1e47in\u0101\u1e41 deham \u0101\u015brita\u1e25\n\n\npr\u0101\u1e47\u0101p\u0101na-sam\u0101yukta\u1e25\n\n\npac\u0101my anna\u1e41 catur-vidham\n\n\naham\u2014I; vai\u015bv\u0101nara\u1e25\u2014by My plenary portion as the digesting fire;\nbh\u016btv\u0101\u2014becoming; pr\u0101\u1e47in\u0101m\u2014of all living entities; deham\u2014body; \u0101\u015brita\u1e25\u2014situated;\npr\u0101\u1e47a\u2014outgoing air; ap\u0101na\u2014downgoing air; sam\u0101yukta\u1e25\u2014keep balance; pac\u0101mi\u2014digest;\nannam\u2014foodstuff; catur-vidham\u2014four kinds of.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nI am the fire of digestion in every living body, and I am the air of life,\noutgoing and incoming, by which I digest the four kinds of foodstuff.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nAccording to \u0100yur-vedic \u015b\u0101stra, we understand that there is a fire in the\nstomach which digests all food sent there. When the fire is not blazing, there\nis no hunger, and when the fire is in order, we become hungry. Sometimes when\nthe fire is not going nicely, treatment is required. In any case, this fire is\nrepresentative of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Vedic mantras also confirm\nthat the Supreme Lord or Brahman is situated in the form of fire within the\nstomach and is digesting all kinds of foodstuff. Therefore since He is helping\nthe digestion of all kinds of foodstuff, the living entity is not independant in\nthe eating process. Unless the Supreme Lord helps him in digesting, there is no\npossibility of eating. He thus produces and digests foodstuff, and, by His\ngrace, we are enjoying life. In the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra this is also confirmed:\n\u015babd\u0101dibhyo \u2019nta\u1e25 prati\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101n\u0101c ca. The Lord is situated within sound and within\nthe body, within the air and even within the stomach as the digestive force.\nThere are four kinds of foodstuff: some are swallowed, some are chewed, some are\nlicked up, and some are sucked, and He is the digestive force for all of them.\n\n\n15.15\n\n\nsarvasya c\u0101ha\u1e41 h\u1e5bdi sannivi\u1e63\u1e6do\n\n\nmatta\u1e25 sm\u1e5btir j\u00f1\u0101nam apohana\u1e41 ca\n\n\nvedai\u015b ca sarvair aham eva vedyo\n\n\nved\u0101nta-k\u1e5bd veda-vid eva c\u0101ham\n\n\nsarvasya\u2014of all living beings; ca\u2014and; aham\u2014I; h\u1e5bdi\u2014in the heart;\nsannivi\u1e63\u1e6da\u1e25\u2014being situated; matta\u1e25\u2014from Me; sm\u1e5bti\u1e25\u2014remembrance;\nj\u00f1\u0101nam\u2014knowledge; apohanam ca\u2014and forgetfulness; vedai\u1e25\u2014by the Vedas; ca\u2014also;\nsarvai\u1e25\u2014all; aham\u2014I am; eva\u2014certainly; vedya\u1e25\u2014knowable; ved\u0101nta-k\u1e5bt\u2014the compiler\nof the Ved\u0101nta; veda-vit\u2014the knower of the Vedas; eva\u2014certainly; ca\u2014and; aham\u2014I.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nI am seated in everyone\u2019s heart, and from Me come remembrance, knowledge and\nforgetfulness. By all the Vedas am I to be known; indeed I am the compiler of\nVed\u0101nta, and I am the knower of the Vedas.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe Supreme Lord is situated as Param\u0101tm\u0101 in everyone\u2019s heart, and it is from\nHim that all activities are initiated. The living entity forgets everything of\nhis past life, but he has to act according to the direction of the Supreme Lord,\nwho is witness to all his work. Therefore he begins his work according to his\npast deeds. Required knowledge is supplied to him, and remembrance is given to\nhim, and he forgets, also, about his past life. Thus, the Lord is not only\nall-pervading; He is also localized in every individual heart. He awards the\ndifferent fruitive results. He is not only worshipable as the impersonal\nBrahman, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and the localized Param\u0101tm\u0101, but as\nthe form of the incarnation of the Vedas as well. The Vedas give the right\ndirection to the people so that they can properly mold their lives and come back\nto Godhead, back to home. The Vedas offer knowledge of the Supreme Personality\nof Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in His incarnation as Vy\u0101sadeva is the compiler of\nthe Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra. The commentation on the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra by Vy\u0101sadeva in the\n\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam gives the real understanding of Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra. The Supreme\nLord is so full that for the deliverance of the conditioned soul He is the\nsupplier and digester of foodstuff, the witness of his activity, the giver of\nknowledge in the form of Vedas and as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, \u015ar\u012b\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the teacher of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. He is worshipable by the conditioned\nsoul. Thus God is all-good; God is all-merciful.\n\n\nAnta\u1e25pravi\u1e63\u1e6da\u1e25 \u015b\u0101st\u0101 jan\u0101n\u0101m. The living entity forgets as soon as he quits his\npresent body, but he begins his work again, initiated by the Supreme Lord.\nAlthough he forgets, the Lord gives him the intelligence to renew his work where\nhe ended his last life. So not only does a living entity enjoy or suffer in this\nworld according to the dictation from the Supreme Lord situated locally in the\nheart, but he receives the opportunity to understand Vedas from Him. If one is\nserious to understand the Vedic knowledge, then K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a gives the required\nintelligence. Why does He present the Vedic knowledge for understanding? Because\na living entity individually needs to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Vedic literature\nconfirms this: yo \u2019sau sarvair vedair g\u012byate. In all Vedic literature, beginning\nfrom the four Vedas, Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra and the Upani\u1e63ads and Pur\u0101\u1e47as, the glories of\nthe Supreme Lord are celebrated. By performing Vedic rituals, discussing the\nVedic philosophy and worshiping the Lord in devotional service, He is attained.\nTherefore the purpose of the Vedas is to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The Vedas give us\ndirection to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and the process of understanding. The ultimate\ngoal is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra confirms this in the\nfollowing words: tat tu samanvay\u0101t. One can attain perfection by understanding\nVedic literature, and one can understand his relationship with the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead by performing the different processes. Thus one can\napproach Him and at the end attain the supreme goal, who is no other than the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead. In this verse, however, the purpose of the\nVedas, the understanding of the Vedas and the goal of Vedas are clearly defined.\n\n\n15.16\n\n\ndv\u0101v imau puru\u1e63au loke\n\n\nk\u1e63ara\u015b c\u0101k\u1e63ara eva ca\n\n\nk\u1e63ara\u1e25 sarv\u0101\u1e47i bh\u016bt\u0101ni\n\n\nk\u016b\u1e6da-stho \u2019k\u1e63ara ucyate\n\n\ndvau\u2014two; imau\u2014in this (world); puru\u1e63au\u2014living entities; loke\u2014in the world;\nk\u1e63ara\u1e25\u2014fallible; ca\u2014and; ak\u1e63ara\u1e25\u2014infallible; eva\u2014certainly; ca\u2014and; k\u1e63ara\u1e25\u2014the\nfallible; sarv\u0101\u1e47i\u2014all; bh\u016bt\u0101ni\u2014living entities; k\u016b\u1e6dastha\u1e25\u2014in oneness;\nak\u1e63ara\u1e25\u2014infallible; ucyate\u2014is said.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThere are two classes of beings, the fallible and the infallible. In the\nmaterial world every entity is fallible, and in the spiritual world every entity\nis called infallible.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nAs already explained, the Lord in His incarnation as Vy\u0101sadeva compiled the\nVed\u0101nta-sutra. Here the Lord is giving, in summary, the contents of the\nVed\u0101nta-s\u016btra: He says that the living entities, who are innumerable, can be\ndivided into two classes\u2014the fallible and the infallible. The living entities\nare eternally separated parts and parcels of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\nWhen they are in contact with the material world, they are called j\u012bva-bh\u016bt\u0101\u1e25,\nand the Sanskrit words given here, sarv\u0101\u1e47i bh\u016bt\u0101ni mean that they are fallible.\nThose who are in oneness with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, however, are\ncalled infallible. Oneness does not mean that they have no individuality, but\nthat there is no disunity. They are all agreeable to the purpose of the\ncreation. Of course, in the spiritual world, there is no such thing as creation,\nbut since the Supreme Personality of Godhead has stated in the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra\nthat He is the source of all emanations, that conception is explained.\n\n\nAccording to the statement of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a,\nthere are two classes of men. The Vedas give evidence of this, so there is no\ndoubt about it. The living entities, who are struggling in this world with the\nmind and five senses, have their material bodies which are changing as long as\nthe living entities are conditioned. One\u2019s body changes due to contact with\nmatter; matter is changing, so the living entity appears to be changing. But in\nthe spiritual world the body is not made of matter; therefore there is no\nchange. In the material world the living entity undergoes six changes\u2014birth,\ngrowth, duration, reproduction, then dwindling and vanishing. These are the\nchanges of the material body. But in the spiritual world the body does not\nchange; there is no old age, there is no birth, there is no death. There all\nexists in oneness. It is more clearly explained as sarv\u0101\u1e47i bh\u016bt\u0101ni: any living\nentity who has come in contact with matter, beginning from the first created\nbeing, Brahm\u0101, down to a small ant, is changing its body; therefore they are all\nfallible. In the spiritual world, however, they are always liberated in oneness.\n\n\n15.17\n\n\nuttama\u1e25 puru\u1e63as tv anya\u1e25\n\n\nparam\u0101tmety ud\u0101h\u1e5bta\u1e25\n\n\nyo loka-trayam \u0101vi\u015bya\n\n\nbibharty avyaya \u012b\u015bvara\u1e25\n\n\nuttama\u1e25\u2014the best; puru\u1e63a\u1e25\u2014personality; tu\u2014but; anya\u1e25\u2014another; param\u2014the Supreme;\n\u0101tm\u0101\u2014Self; iti\u2014thus; ud\u0101h\u1e5bta\u1e25\u2014said; ya\u1e25\u2014one who; loka\u2014of the universe;\ntrayam\u2014the three divisions; \u0101vi\u015bya\u2014entering; bibharti\u2014maintaining;\navyaya\u1e25\u2014inexhaustible; \u012b\u015bvara\u1e25\u2014the Lord.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nBesides these two, there is the greatest living personality, the Lord Himself,\nwho has entered into these worlds and is maintaining them.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThis verse is very nicely expressed in the Ka\u1e6dha Upani\u1e63ad and \u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara\nUpani\u1e63ad. It is clearly stated there that above the innumerable living entities,\nsome of whom are conditioned and some of whom are liberated, there is the\nSupreme Personality who is Param\u0101tm\u0101. The Upanisadic verse runs as follows:\nnityo nity\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 cetana\u015b cetan\u0101n\u0101m. The purport is that amongst all the living\nentities, both conditioned and liberated, there is one supreme living\npersonality, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who maintains them and gives\nthem all the facility of enjoyment according to different work. That Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead is situated in everyone\u2019s heart as Param\u0101tm\u0101. A wise man\nwho can understand Him is eligible to attain the perfect peace, not others.\n\n\nIt is incorrect to think of the Supreme Lord and the living entities as being on\nthe same level or equal in all respects. There is always the question of\nsuperiority and inferiority in their personalities. This particular word uttama\nis very significant. No one can surpass the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Loke\nis also significant because in the Pauru\u1e63a, a Vedic literature, it is stated:\nlokyate ved\u0101rtho \u2019nena. This Supreme Lord in His localized aspect as Param\u0101tm\u0101\nexplains the purpose of the Vedas. The following verse also appears in the\nVedas:\n\n\nt\u0101vad e\u1e63a sampras\u0101do \u2019sm\u0101c char\u012br\u0101t samutth\u0101ya para\u1e41 jyoti-r\u016bpa\u1e41 sampadya svena\nr\u016bpe\u1e47\u0101bhini\u1e63padyate sa uttama\u1e25 puru\u1e63a\u1e25\n\n\n\u201cThe Supersoul coming out of the body enters the impersonal brahmajyoti; then in\nHis form He remains in His spiritual identity. That Supreme is called the\nSupreme Personality.\u201d This means that the Supreme Personality is exhibiting and\ndiffusing His spiritual effulgence, which is the ultimate illumination. That\nSupreme Personality also has a localized aspect as Param\u0101tm\u0101. By incarnating\nHimself as the son of Satyavat\u012b and Par\u0101\u015bara, He explains the Vedic knowledge as\nVy\u0101sadeva.\n\n\n15.18\n\n\nyasm\u0101t k\u1e63aram at\u012bto \u2019ham\n\n\nak\u1e63ar\u0101d api cottama\u1e25\n\n\nato \u2019smi loke vede ca\n\n\nprathita\u1e25 puru\u1e63ottama\u1e25\n\n\nyasm\u0101t\u2014because; k\u1e63aram\u2014the fallible; at\u012bta\u1e25\u2014transcendental; aham\u2014I; ak\u1e63ar\u0101t\u2014from\nthe infallible; api\u2014better than that; ca\u2014and; uttama\u1e25\u2014the best; ata\u1e25\u2014therefore;\nasmi\u2014I am; loke\u2014in the world; vede\u2014in the Vedic literature; ca\u2014and;\nprathita\u1e25\u2014celebrated; puru\u1e63ottama\u1e25\u2014as the Supreme Personality.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nBecause I am transcendental, beyond both the fallible and the infallible, and\nbecause I am the greatest, I am celebrated both in the world and in the Vedas as\nthat Supreme Person.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nNo one can surpass the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2014neither the\nconditioned soul nor the liberated soul. He is, therefore, the greatest of\npersonalities. Now it is clear here that the living entities and the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead are individuals. The difference is that the living\nentities, either in the conditioned state or in the liberated state, cannot\nsurpass in quantity the inconceivable potencies of the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead.\n\n\n15.19\n\n\nyo m\u0101m evam asamm\u016b\u1e0dho\n\n\nj\u0101n\u0101ti puru\u1e63ottamam\n\n\nsa sarva-vid bhajati m\u0101\u1e41\n\n\nsarva-bh\u0101vena bh\u0101rata\n\n\nya\u1e25\u2014anyone; m\u0101m\u2014unto Me; evam\u2014certainly; asamm\u016b\u1e0dha\u1e25\u2014without a doubt;\nj\u0101n\u0101ti\u2014knows; puru\u1e63ottamam\u2014the Supreme Personality of Godhead; sa\u1e25\u2014he;\nsarva-vit\u2014knower of everything; bhajati\u2014renders devotional service; m\u0101m\u2014unto Me;\nsarva-bh\u0101vena\u2014in all respects; bh\u0101rata\u2014O son of Bharata.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nWhoever knows Me as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, without doubting, is to\nbe understood as the knower of everything, and he therefore engages himself in\nfull devotional service, O son of Bharata\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThere are many philosophical speculations about the constitutional position of\nthe living entities and the Supreme Absolute Truth. Now in this verse the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead clearly explains that anyone who knows Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nas the Supreme Person is actually the knower of everything. The imperfect knower\ngoes on simply speculating about the Absolute Truth, but the perfect knower,\nwithout wasting his valuable time, engages directly in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, the\ndevotional service of the Supreme Lord. Throughout the whole of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101,\nthis fact is being stressed at every step. And still there are so many stubborn\ncommentators on Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 who consider the Supreme Absolute Truth and the\nliving entities to be one and the same.\n\n\nVedic knowledge is called \u015bruti learning by aural reception. One should actually\nreceive the Vedic message from authorities like K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and His representatives.\nHere K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a distinguishes everything very nicely, and one should hear from this\nsource. Simply to hear like the hogs is not sufficient; one must be able to\nunderstand from the authorities. It is not that one should simply speculate\nacademically. One should submissively hear from Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that these living\nentities are always subordinate to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Anyone\nwho is able to understand this, according to the Supreme Personality of Godhead,\n\u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, knows the purpose of the Vedas; no one else knows the purpose of the\nVedas.\n\n\nThe word bhajate is very significant. In many places the word bhajate is\nexpressed in relationship with the service of the Supreme Lord. If a person is\nengaged in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness in devotional service of the Lord, it is to\nbe understood that he has understood all the Vedic knowledge. In the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava\nparampar\u0101 it is said that if one is engaged in the devotional service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a,\nthen there is no need for a spiritual process to understand the Supreme Absolute\nTruth. He has already come to the post because he is engaged in the devotional\nservice of the Lord. He has ended all preliminary processes of understanding;\nsimilarly, if anyone, after speculating for hundreds of thousands of lives, does\nnot come to the point that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and that\none has to surrender there, all his speculation for so many years and lives is a\nuseless waste of time.\n\n\n15.20\n\n\niti guhyatama\u1e41 \u015b\u0101stram\n\n\nidam ukta\u1e41 may\u0101nagha\n\n\netad buddhv\u0101 buddhim\u0101n sy\u0101t\n\n\nk\u1e5bta-k\u1e5btya\u015b ca bh\u0101rata\n\n\niti\u2014thus; guhyatamam\u2014the most confidential; \u015b\u0101stram\u2014revealed scriptures;\nidam\u2014this; uktam\u2014disclosed; may\u0101\u2014by Me; anagha\u2014O sinless one; etat\u2014this;\nbuddhv\u0101\u2014understanding; buddhim\u0101n\u2014intelligent; sy\u0101t\u2014one becomes; k\u1e5bta-k\u1e5btya\u1e25\u2014the\nmost perfect; ca\u2014and; bh\u0101rata\u2014O son of Bharata.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThis is the most confidential part of the Vedic scriptures, O sinless one, and\nit is disclosed now by Me. Whoever understands this will become wise, and his\nendeavors will know perfection.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe Lord clearly explains here that this is the substance of all revealed\nscriptures. And one should understand this as it is given by the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead. Thus one will become intelligent and perfect in\ntranscendental knowledge. In other words, by understanding this philosophy of\nthe Supreme Personality of Godhead and engaging in His transcendental service,\neveryone can become freed from all contaminations of the modes of material\nnature. Devotional service is a process of spiritual understanding. Wherever\ndevotional service exists, the material contamination cannot coexist. Devotional\nservice to the Lord and the Lord Himself are one and the same because they are\nspiritual\u2014the internal energy of the Supreme Lord. The Lord is said to be the\nsun, and ignorance is called darkness. Where the sun is present, there is no\nquestion of darkness. Therefore, whenever devotional service is present under\nthe proper guidance of a bona fide spiritual master, there is no question of\nignorance.\n\n\nEveryone must take to this consciousness of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and engage in devotional\nservice to become intelligent and purified. Unless one comes to this position of\nunderstanding K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and engages in devotional service, however intelligent he\nmay be in the estimation of some common man, he is not perfectly intelligent.\n\n\nThe word anagha, by which Arjuna is addressed, is significant. Anagha, O sinless\none, means that unless one is free from all sinful reactions, it is very\ndifficult to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. One has to become free from all contamination,\nall sinful activities; then he can understand. But devotional service is so pure\nand potent that once one is engaged in devotional service he automatically comes\nto the stage of sinlessness.\n\n\nWhile performing devotional service in the association of pure devotees in full\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, there are certain things which require to be vanquished\naltogether. The most important thing one has to surmount is weakness of the\nheart. The first falldown is caused by the desire to lord it over material\nnature. Thus one gives up the transcendental loving service of the Supreme Lord.\nThe second weakness of the heart is that as one increases the propensity of\nlording it over material nature, he becomes attached to matter and the\npossession of matter. The problems of material existence are due to these\nweaknesses of the heart.",

TRANSLATION  The Blessed Lord said: There is a banyan tree which has its roots upward and its\nbranches down and whose leaves are the Vedic hymns. One who knows this tree is\nthe knower of the Vedas.  PURPORT  After the discussion of the importance of bhakti-yoga, one may question, \u201cWhat\nabout the Vedas?\u201d It is explained in this chapter that the purpose of Vedic\nstudy is to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore one who is in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, who\nis engaged in devotional service, already knows the Vedas.  The entanglement of this material world is compared here to a banyan tree. For\none who is engaged in fruitive activities, there is no end to the banyan tree.\nHe wanders from one branch to another, to another, to another. The tree of this\nmaterial world has no end, and for one who is attached to this tree, there is no\npossibility of liberation. The Vedic hymns, meant for elevating oneself, are\ncalled the leaves of this tree. This tree\u2019s roots grow upward because they begin\nfrom where Brahm\u0101 is located, the topmost planet of this universe. If one can\nunderstand this indestructible tree of illusion, then one can get out of it.  This process of extrication should be understood. In the previous chapters it\nhas been explained that there are many processes by which to get out of the\nmaterial entanglement. And, up to the Thirteenth Chapter, we have seen that\ndevotional service to the Supreme Lord is the best way. Now, the basic principle\nof devotional service is detachment from material activities and attachment to\nthe transcendental service of the Lord. The process of breaking attachment to\nthe material world is discussed in the beginning of this chapter. The root of\nthis material existence grows upward. This means that it begins from the total\nmaterial substance, from the topmost planet of the universe. From there, the\nwhole universe is expanded, with so many branches, representing the various\nplanetary systems. The fruits represent the results of the living entities\u2019\nactivities, namely, religion, economic development, sense gratification and\nliberation.  Now, there is no ready experience in this world of a tree situated with its\nbranches down and its roots upward, but there is such a thing. That tree can be\nfound beside a reservoir of water. We can see that the trees on the bank reflect\nupon the water with their branches down and roots up. In other words, the tree\nof this material world is only a reflection of the real tree of the spiritual\nworld. This reflection of the spiritual world is situated on desire, just as the\ntree\u2019s reflection is situated on water. Desire is the cause of things\u2019 being\nsituated in this reflected material light. One who wants to get out of this\nmaterial existence must know this tree thoroughly through analytical study. Then\nhe can cut off his relationship with it.  This tree, being the reflection of the real tree, is an exact replica.\nEverything is there in the spiritual world. The impersonalists take Brahm\u0101 to be\nthe root of this material tree, and from the root, according to s\u0101\u1e45khya\nphilosophy, come prak\u1e5bti, puru\u1e63a, then the three gu\u1e47as, then the five gross\nelements (pa\u00f1ca-mah\u0101bh\u016bta), then the ten senses (da\u015bendriya), mind, etc. In this\nway they divide up the whole material world. If Brahm\u0101 is the center of all\nmanifestations, then this material world is a manifestation of the center by 180\ndegrees, and the other 180 degrees constitute the spiritual world. The material\nworld is the perverted reflection, so the spiritual world must have the same\nvariegatedness, but in reality. The prak\u1e5bti is the external energy of the\nSupreme Lord, and the puru\u1e63a is the Supreme Lord Himself, and that is explained\nin Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Since this manifestation is material, it is temporary. A\nreflection is temporary, for it is sometimes seen and sometimes not seen. But\nthe origin from whence the reflection is reflected is eternal. The material\nreflection of the real tree has to be cut off. When it is said that a person\nknows the Vedas, it is assumed that he knows how to cut off attachment to this\nmaterial world. If one knows that process, he actually knows the Vedas. One who\nis attracted by the ritualistic formulas of the Vedas is attracted by the\nbeautiful green leaves of the tree. He does not exactly know the purpose of the\nVedas. The purpose of the Vedas, as disclosed by the Personality of Godhead\nHimself, is to cut down this reflected tree and attain the real tree of the\nspiritual world.",

TRANSLATION  The branches of this tree extend downward and upward, nourished by the three\nmodes of material nature. The twigs are the objects of the senses. This tree\nalso has roots going down, and these are bound to the fruitive actions of human\nsociety.  PURPORT  The description of the banyan tree is further explained here. Its branches are\nspread in all directions. In the lower parts, there are variegated\nmanifestations of living entities, such as human beings, animals, horses, cows,\ndogs, cats, etc. These are situated on the lower parts of the branches, whereas\non the upper parts are higher forms of living entities: the demigods, Gandharvas\n(fairies), and many other higher species of life. As a tree is nourished by\nwater, so this tree is nourished by the three modes of material nature.\nSometimes we find that a tract of land is barren for want of sufficient water,\nand sometimes a tract is very green; similarly, where the modes of material\nnature are proportionately greater in quantity, the different species of life\nare manifested in that proportion.  The twigs of the tree are considered to be the sense objects. By development of\nthe different modes of nature, we develop different senses, and, by the senses,\nwe enjoy different varieties of sense objects. The source of the senses\u2014the\nears, the nose, eyes, etc.\u2014is considered to be the upper twigs, tuned to the\nenjoyment of different sense objects. The leaves are sound, form, touch\u2014the\nsense objects. The roots, which are subsidiary, are the by-products of different\nvarieties of suffering and sense enjoyment. Thus we develop attachment and\naversion. The tendencies toward piety and impiety are considered to be the\nsecondary roots, spreading in all directions. The real root is from Brahmaloka,\nand the other roots are in the human planetary systems. After one enjoys the\nresults of virtuous activities in the upper planetary systems, he comes down to\nthis earth and renews his karma or fruitive activities for promotion. This\nplanet of human beings is considered the field of activities.",

TRANSLATION  The real form of this tree cannot be perceived in this world. No one can\nunderstand where it ends, where it begins, or where its foundation is. But with\ndetermination one must cut down this tree with the weapon of detachment. So\ndoing, one must seek that place from which, having once gone, one never returns,\nand there surrender to that Supreme Personality of Godhead from whom everything\nhas begun and in whom everything is abiding since time immemorial.  PURPORT  It is now clearly stated that the real form of this banyan tree cannot be\nunderstood in this material world. Since the root is upwards, the extension of\nthe real tree is at the other end. No one can see how far the tree extends, nor\ncan one see the beginning of this tree. Yet one has to find out the cause. \u201cI am\nthe son of my father, my father is the son of such and such a person, etc.\u201d By\nsearching in this way, one comes to Brahm\u0101, who is generated by the\nGarbhodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Finally, in this way, when one reaches to the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead, that is the end of research work. One has to search out\nthat origin of this tree, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, through the\nassociation of persons who are in the knowledge of that Supreme Personality of\nGodhead. Then by understanding one becomes gradually detached from this false\nreflection of reality, and by knowledge one can cut off the connection and\nactually become situated in the real tree.  The word asa\u1e45ga is very important in this connection because the attachment for\nsense enjoyment and lording it over the material nature is very strong.\nTherefore one must learn detachment by discussion of spiritual science based on\nauthoritative scriptures, and one must hear from persons who are actually in\nknowledge. As a result of such discussion in the association of devotees, one\ncomes to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Then the first thing one must do is\nsurrender to Him. The description of that place whence going no one returns to\nthis false reflected tree is given here. The Supreme Personality of Godhead,\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is the original root from whom everything has emanated. To gain favor of\nthat Personality of Godhead, one has only to surrender, and this is a result of\nperforming devotional service by hearing, chanting, etc. He is the cause of this\nextension of this material world. This is already explained by the Lord Himself:\naha\u1e41 sarvasya prabhava\u1e25. \u201cI am the origin of everything.\u201d  Therefore to get out of the entanglement of this strong banyan tree of material\nlife, one must surrender to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. As soon as one surrenders unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he\nbecomes detached automatically from this material extension.",

TRANSLATION  One who is free from illusion, false prestige, and false association, who\nunderstands the eternal, who is done with material lust and is freed from the\nduality of happiness and distress, and who knows how to surrender unto the\nSupreme Person, attains to that eternal kingdom.  PURPORT  The surrendering process is described here very nicely. The first qualification\nis that one should not be deluded by pride. Because the conditioned soul is\npuffed up, thinking himself the lord of material nature, it is very difficult\nfor him to surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One should know by\nthe cultivation of real knowledge that he is not lord of material nature; the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead is the Lord. When one is free from delusion\ncaused by pride, he can begin the process of surrender. For one who is always\nexpecting some honor in this material world, it is not possible to surrender to\nthe Supreme Person. Pride is due to illusion, for although one comes here, stays\nfor a brief time and then goes away, he has the foolish notion that he is the\nlord of the world. He thus makes all things complicated, and he is always in\ntrouble. The whole world moves under this impression. People are considering\nthat the land, this earth, belongs to human society, and they have divided the\nland under the false impression that they are the proprietors. One has to get\nout of this false notion that human society is the proprietor of this world.\nWhen one is freed from such a false notion, he becomes free from all the false\nassociations caused by familial, social, and national affections. These fake\nassociations bind one to this material world. After this stage, one has to\ndevelop spiritual knowledge. One has to cultivate knowledge of what is actually\nhis own and what is actually not his own. And, when one has an understanding of\nthings as they are, he becomes free from all dual conceptions such as happiness\nand distress, pleasure and pain. He becomes full in knowledge; then it is\npossible for him to surrender to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.",

TRANSLATION  That abode of Mine is not illumined by the sun or moon, nor by electricity. One\nwho reaches it never returns to this material world.  PURPORT  The spiritual world, the abode of the Supreme Personality of Godhead,\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2014which is known as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aloka, Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana\u2014is described here. In the\nspiritual sky there is no need of sunshine, moonshine, fire or electricity,\nbecause all the planets are self-luminous. We have only one planet in this\nuniverse, the sun, which is self-luminous, but all the planets in the spiritual\nsky are self-luminous. The shining effulgence of all those planets (called\nVaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhas) constitutes the shining sky known as the brahmajyoti. Actually, the\neffulgence is emanating from the planet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. Part of that\nshining effulgence is covered by the mahat-tattva, the material world. Other\nthan this, the major portion of that shining sky is full of spiritual planets,\nwhich are called Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhas, chief of which is Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana.  As long as a living entity is in this dark material world, he is in conditional\nlife, but as soon as he reaches the spiritual sky, by cutting through the false,\nperverted tree of this material world, he becomes liberated. Then there is no\nchance of his coming back here. In his conditional life, the living entity\nconsiders himself to be the lord of this material world, but in his liberated\nstate he enters into the spiritual kingdom and becomes the associate of the\nSupreme Lord. There he enjoys eternal bliss, eternal life, and full knowledge.  One should be captivated by this information. He should desire to transfer\nhimself to that eternal world and extricate himself from this false reflection\nof reality. For one who is too much attached to this material world, it is very\ndifficult to cut that attachment, but if he takes to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, there\nis a chance of gradually becoming detached. One has to associate himself with\ndevotees, those who are in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. One should search out a society\ndedicated to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and learn how to discharge devotional service.\nIn this way he can cut off his attachment to the material world. One cannot\nbecome detached from the attraction of the material world simply by dressing\nhimself in saffron cloth. He must become attached to the devotional service of\nthe Lord. Therefore one should take it very seriously that devotional service as\ndescribed in the Twelfth Chapter is the only way to get out of this false\nrepresentation of the real tree. In Chapter Fourteen the contamination of all\nkinds of processes by material nature is described. Only devotional service is\ndescribed as purely transcendental.  The words parama\u1e41 mama are very important here. Actually every nook and corner\nis the property of the Supreme Lord, but the spiritual world is paramam, full of\nsix opulences. In the Upani\u1e63ads it is also confirmed that in the spiritual world\nthere is no need of sunshine or moonshine, for the whole spiritual sky is\nilluminated by the internal potency of the Supreme Lord. That supreme abode can\nbe achieved only by surrender and by no other means.",

TRANSLATION  The living entities in this conditioned world are My eternal, fragmental parts.\nDue to conditioned life, they are struggling very hard with the six senses,\nwhich include the mind.  PURPORT  In this verse the identity of the living being is clearly given. The living\nentity is the fragmental part and parcel of the Supreme Lord\u2014eternally. It is\nnot that he assumes individuality in his conditional life and in his liberated\nstate becomes one with the Supreme Lord. He is eternally fragmented. It is\nclearly said, san\u0101tana\u1e25. According to the Vedic version, the Supreme Lord\nmanifests and expands Himself in innumerable expansions, of which the primary\nexpansions are called Vi\u1e63\u1e47u-tattva, and the secondary expansions are called the\nliving entities. In other words, the Vi\u1e63\u1e47u-tattva is the personal expansion, and\nthe living entities are separated expansions. By His personal expansion, He is\nmanifested in various forms like Lord R\u0101ma, N\u1e5bsi\u1e41hadeva, Vi\u1e63\u1e47um\u016brti and all the\npredominating Deities in the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets. The separated expansions, the\nliving entities, are eternally servitors. The personal expansions of the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead, the individual identities of the Godhead, are always\npresent. Similarly, the separated expansions of living entities have their\nidentities. As fragmental parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord, the living\nentities have also fragmental qualities, of which independence is one. Every\nliving entity has an individual soul, his personal individuality and a minute\nform of independence. By misuse of that independence, one becomes a conditioned\nsoul, and by proper use of independence he is always liberated. In either case,\nhe is qualititatively eternal, as the Supreme Lord is. In his liberated state he\nis freed from this material condition, and he is under the engagement of\ntranscendental service unto the Lord; in his conditioned life he is dominated by\nthe material modes of nature, and he forgets the transcendental loving service\nof the Lord. As a result, he has to struggle very hard to maintain his existence\nin the material world.  The living entities, not only the human beings and the cats and dogs, but even\nthe greater controllers of the material world\u2014Brahm\u0101, Lord \u015aiva, and even\nVi\u1e63\u1e47u\u2014are all parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord. They are all eternal, not\ntemporary manifestations. The word kar\u1e63ati (struggling or grappling hard) is\nvery significant. The conditioned soul is bound up, as though shackled by iron\nchains. He is bound up by the false ego, and the mind is the chief agent which\nis driving him in this material existence. When the mind is in the mode of\ngoodness, his activities are good; when the mind is in the mode of passion, his\nactivities are troublesome; and when the mind is in the mode of ignorance, he\ntravels in the lower species of life. It is clear, however, in this verse, that\nthe conditioned soul is covered by the material body, with the mind and the\nsenses, and when he is liberated this material covering perishes, but his\nspiritual body manifests in its individual capacity. The following information\nis there in the M\u0101dhyandi-n\u0101yana-\u015bruti: sa v\u0101 e\u1e63a brahma-ni\u1e63\u1e6dha ida\u1e41 sar\u012bra\u1e41\nmarttyam atis\u1e5bjya brahm\u0101bhisampadya brahma\u1e47\u0101 pa\u015byati brahma\u1e47\u0101 \u015b\u1e5bnoti\nbrahma\u1e47aiveda\u1e41 sarvam anubhavati. It is stated here that when a living entity\ngives up this material embodiment and enters into the spiritual world, he\nrevives his spiritual body, and in his spiritual body he can see the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead face to face. He can hear and speak to Him face to face,\nand he can understand the Supreme Personality as He is. In sm\u1e5bti also it is\nunderstood that in the spiritual planets everyone lives in bodies featured like\nthe Supreme Personality of Godhead\u2019s. As far as bodily construction is\nconcerned, there is no difference between the part and parcel living entities\nand the expansions of Vi\u1e63\u1e47um\u016brti. In other words, at liberation the living\nentity gets a spiritual body by the grace of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.  The word mamaiv\u0101\u1e41\u015ba\u1e25 (fragmental parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord) is also\nvery significant. The fragmental portion of the Supreme Lord is not like some\nmaterial broken part. We have already understood in the Second Chapter that the\nspirit cannot be cut into pieces. This fragment is not materially conceived. It\nis not like matter which can be cut into pieces and joined together again. That\nconception is not applicable here because the Sanskrit word san\u0101tana (eternal)\nis used. The fragmental portion is eternal. It is also stated in the beginning\nof the Second Chapter that (dehino \u2019smin yath\u0101) in each and every individual\nbody, the fragmental portion of the Supreme Lord is present. That fragmental\nportion, when liberated from the bodily entanglement, revives its original\nspiritual body in the spiritual sky in a spiritual planet and enjoys association\nwith the Supreme Lord. It is, however, understood here that the living entity,\nbeing the fragmental part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, is qualitatively one,\njust as the parts and parcels of gold are also gold.",

TRANSLATION  The living entity in the material world carries his different conceptions of\nlife from one body to another as the air carries aromas.  PURPORT  Here the living entity is described as \u012b\u015bvara, the controller of his own body.\nIf he likes, he can change his body to a higher grade, and if he likes he can\nmove to a lower class. Minute independence is there. The change his body\nundergoes depends upon him. At the time of death, the consciousness he has\ncreated will carry him on to the next type of body. If he has made his\nconsciousness like that of a cat or dog, he is sure to change to a cat\u2019s or\ndog\u2019s body. And, if he has fixed his consciousness on godly qualities, he will\nchange into the form of a demigod. And, if he is in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, he will\nbe transferred to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aloka in the spiritual world and will associate with\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. It is a false claim that after the annihilation of this body everything\nis finished. The individual soul is transmigrating from one body to another, and\nhis present body and present activities are the background of his next body. One\ngets a different body according to karma, and he has to quit this body in due\ncourse. It is stated here that the subtle body, which carries the conception of\nthe next body, develops another body in the next life. This process of\ntransmigrating from one body to another and struggling while in the body is\ncalled kar\u1e63ati or struggle for existence.",

TRANSLATION  The foolish cannot understand how a living entity can quit his body, nor can\nthey understand what sort of body he enjoys under the spell of the modes of\nnature. But one whose eyes are trained in knowledge can see all this.  PURPORT  The word j\u00f1\u0101na-cak\u1e63u\u1e63a\u1e25 is very significant. Without knowledge, one cannot\nunderstand how a living entity leaves his present body, nor what form of body he\nis going to take in the next life, nor even why he is living in a particular\ntype of body. This requires a great amount of knowledge understood from\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and similar literatures heard from a bona fide spiritual master.\nOne who is trained to perceive all these things is fortunate. Every living\nentity is quitting his body under certain circumstances; he is living under\ncertain circumstances and enjoying under certain circumstances under the spell\nof material nature. As a result, he is suffering different kinds of happiness\nand distress, under the illusion of sense enjoyment. Persons who are\neverlastingly fooled by lust and desire lose all power of understanding their\nchange of body and their stay in a particular body. They cannot comprehend it.\nThose who have developed spiritual knowledge, however, can see that the spirit\nis different from the body and is changing its body and enjoying in different\nways. A person in such knowledge can understand how the conditioned living\nentity is suffering in this material existence. Therefore those who are highly\ndeveloped in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness try their best to give this knowledge to the\npeople in general, for their conditional life is very much troublesome. They\nshould come out of it and be K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious and liberate themselves to transfer\nto the spiritual world.",

The word yogina\u1e25 is significant in this\nconnection. In the present day there are many so-called yog\u012bs, and there are\nmany so-called associations of yog\u012bs, but they are actually blind in the matter\nof self-realization.

PURPORT  The unintelligent cannot understand how things are taking place. The beginning\nof knowledge can be established by understanding what the Lord explains here.\nEveryone sees the sun, moon, fire and electricity. One should simply try to\nunderstand that the splendor of the sun, the splendor of the moon, and the\nsplendor of electricity or fire are coming from the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead. In such a conception of life, the beginning of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness,\nlies a great deal of advancement for the conditioned soul in this material\nworld. The living entities are essentially the parts and parcels of the Supreme\nLord, and He is giving herewith the hint how they can come back to Godhead, back\nto home. From this verse we can understand that the sun is illuminating the\nwhole solar system. There are different universes and solar systems, and there\nare different suns, moons and planets also. Sunlight is due to the spiritual\neffulgence in the spiritual sky of the Supreme Lord. With the rise of the sun,\nthe activities of human beings are set up. They set fire to prepare their\nfoodstuff; they set fire to start the factories, etc. So many things are done\nwith the help of fire. Therefore sunrise, fire and moonlight are so pleasing to\nthe living entities. Without their help no living entity can live. So if one can\nunderstand that the light and splendor of the sun, moon and fire are emanating\nfrom the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, then one\u2019s K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness\nwill begin. By the moonshine, all the vegetables are nourished. The moonshine is\nso pleasing that people can easily understand that they are living by the mercy\nof the Supreme Personality of Godhead K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Without His mercy there cannot be\nsun, without His mercy there cannot be moon, and without His mercy there cannot\nbe fire, and without the help of sun, moon and fire, no one can live. These are\nsome thoughts to provoke K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness in the conditioned soul.",

TRANSLATION  I enter into each planet, and by My energy they stay in orbit. I become the moon\nand thereby supply the juice of life to all vegetables.  PURPORT  It is understood that all the planets are floating in the air only by the energy\nof the Lord. The Lord enters into every atom, every planet, and every living\nbeing. That is discussed in the Brahm\u0101-sa\u1e41hit\u0101. It is said there that one\nplenary portion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Param\u0101tm\u0101, enters into\nthe planets, the universe, the living entity, and even into the atom. So due to\nHis entrance, everything is appropriately manifested. When the spirit soul is\nthere, a living man can float on the water, but when the living spark is out of\nthe body and the body is dead, it sinks. Of course when it is decomposed it\nfloats just like straw and other things, but as soon as the man is dead, he at\nonce sinks in the water. Similarly, all these planets are floating in space, and\nthis is due to the entrance of the supreme energy of the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead. His energy is sustaining each planet, just like a handful of dust. If\nsomeone holds a handful of dust, there is no possibility of the dust falling,\nbut if one throws it in the air, it will fall down. Similarly, these planets,\nwhich are floating in air, are actually held in the fist of the universal form\nof the Supreme Lord. By His strength and energy, all moving and unmoving things\nstay in their place. It is said that because of the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead, the sun is shining and the planets are steadily moving. Were it not for\nHim, all the planets would scatter, like dust in air, and perish. Similarly, it\nis due to the Supreme Personality of Godhead that the moon nourishes all\nvegetables. Due to the moon\u2019s influence, the vegetables become delicious.\nWithout the moonshine, the vegetables can neither grow nor taste succulent.\nHuman society is working, living comfortably and enjoying food due to the supply\nfrom the Supreme Lord. Otherwise, mankind could not survive. The word ras\u0101tmaka\u1e25\nis very significant. Everything becomes palatable by the agency of the Supreme\nLord through the influence of the moon.",

TRANSLATION  I am the fire of digestion in every living body, and I am the air of life,\noutgoing and incoming, by which I digest the four kinds of foodstuff.  PURPORT  According to \u0100yur-vedic \u015b\u0101stra, we understand that there is a fire in the\nstomach which digests all food sent there. When the fire is not blazing, there\nis no hunger, and when the fire is in order, we become hungry. Sometimes when\nthe fire is not going nicely, treatment is required. In any case, this fire is\nrepresentative of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Vedic mantras also confirm\nthat the Supreme Lord or Brahman is situated in the form of fire within the\nstomach and is digesting all kinds of foodstuff. Therefore since He is helping\nthe digestion of all kinds of foodstuff, the living entity is not independant in\nthe eating process. Unless the Supreme Lord helps him in digesting, there is no\npossibility of eating. He thus produces and digests foodstuff, and, by His\ngrace, we are enjoying life. In the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra this is also confirmed:\n\u015babd\u0101dibhyo \u2019nta\u1e25 prati\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101n\u0101c ca. The Lord is situated within sound and within\nthe body, within the air and even within the stomach as the digestive force.\nThere are four kinds of foodstuff: some are swallowed, some are chewed, some are\nlicked up, and some are sucked, and He is the digestive force for all of them.",

TRANSLATION  I am seated in everyone\u2019s heart, and from Me come remembrance, knowledge and\nforgetfulness. By all the Vedas am I to be known; indeed I am the compiler of\nVed\u0101nta, and I am the knower of the Vedas.  PURPORT  The Supreme Lord is situated as Param\u0101tm\u0101 in everyone\u2019s heart, and it is from\nHim that all activities are initiated. The living entity forgets everything of\nhis past life, but he has to act according to the direction of the Supreme Lord,\nwho is witness to all his work. Therefore he begins his work according to his\npast deeds. Required knowledge is supplied to him, and remembrance is given to\nhim, and he forgets, also, about his past life. Thus, the Lord is not only\nall-pervading; He is also localized in every individual heart. He awards the\ndifferent fruitive results. He is not only worshipable as the impersonal\nBrahman, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and the localized Param\u0101tm\u0101, but as\nthe form of the incarnation of the Vedas as well. The Vedas give the right\ndirection to the people so that they can properly mold their lives and come back\nto Godhead, back to home. The Vedas offer knowledge of the Supreme Personality\nof Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in His incarnation as Vy\u0101sadeva is the compiler of\nthe Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra. The commentation on the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra by Vy\u0101sadeva in the\n\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam gives the real understanding of Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra. The Supreme\nLord is so full that for the deliverance of the conditioned soul He is the\nsupplier and digester of foodstuff, the witness of his activity, the giver of\nknowledge in the form of Vedas and as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, \u015ar\u012b\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the teacher of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. He is worshipable by the conditioned\nsoul. Thus God is all-good; God is all-merciful.  Anta\u1e25pravi\u1e63\u1e6da\u1e25 \u015b\u0101st\u0101 jan\u0101n\u0101m. The living entity forgets as soon as he quits his\npresent body, but he begins his work again, initiated by the Supreme Lord.\nAlthough he forgets, the Lord gives him the intelligence to renew his work where\nhe ended his last life. So not only does a living entity enjoy or suffer in this\nworld according to the dictation from the Supreme Lord situated locally in the\nheart, but he receives the opportunity to understand Vedas from Him. If one is\nserious to understand the Vedic knowledge, then K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a gives the required\nintelligence. Why does He present the Vedic knowledge for understanding? Because\na living entity individually needs to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Vedic literature\nconfirms this: yo \u2019sau sarvair vedair g\u012byate. In all Vedic literature, beginning\nfrom the four Vedas, Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra and the Upani\u1e63ads and Pur\u0101\u1e47as, the glories of\nthe Supreme Lord are celebrated. By performing Vedic rituals, discussing the\nVedic philosophy and worshiping the Lord in devotional service, He is attained.\nTherefore the purpose of the Vedas is to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The Vedas give us\ndirection to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and the process of understanding. The ultimate\ngoal is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra confirms this in the\nfollowing words: tat tu samanvay\u0101t. One can attain perfection by understanding\nVedic literature, and one can understand his relationship with the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead by performing the different processes. Thus one can\napproach Him and at the end attain the supreme goal, who is no other than the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead. In this verse, however, the purpose of the\nVedas, the understanding of the Vedas and the goal of Vedas are clearly defined.",

TRANSLATION  There are two classes of beings, the fallible and the infallible. In the\nmaterial world every entity is fallible, and in the spiritual world every entity\nis called infallible.  PURPORT  As already explained, the Lord in His incarnation as Vy\u0101sadeva compiled the\nVed\u0101nta-sutra. Here the Lord is giving, in summary, the contents of the\nVed\u0101nta-s\u016btra: He says that the living entities, who are innumerable, can be\ndivided into two classes\u2014the fallible and the infallible. The living entities\nare eternally separated parts and parcels of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\nWhen they are in contact with the material world, they are called j\u012bva-bh\u016bt\u0101\u1e25,\nand the Sanskrit words given here, sarv\u0101\u1e47i bh\u016bt\u0101ni mean that they are fallible.\nThose who are in oneness with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, however, are\ncalled infallible. Oneness does not mean that they have no individuality, but\nthat there is no disunity. They are all agreeable to the purpose of the\ncreation. Of course, in the spiritual world, there is no such thing as creation,\nbut since the Supreme Personality of Godhead has stated in the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra\nthat He is the source of all emanations, that conception is explained.  According to the statement of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a,\nthere are two classes of men. The Vedas give evidence of this, so there is no\ndoubt about it. The living entities, who are struggling in this world with the\nmind and five senses, have their material bodies which are changing as long as\nthe living entities are conditioned. One\u2019s body changes due to contact with\nmatter; matter is changing, so the living entity appears to be changing. But in\nthe spiritual world the body is not made of matter; therefore there is no\nchange. In the material world the living entity undergoes six changes\u2014birth,\ngrowth, duration, reproduction, then dwindling and vanishing. These are the\nchanges of the material body. But in the spiritual world the body does not\nchange; there is no old age, there is no birth, there is no death. There all\nexists in oneness. It is more clearly explained as sarv\u0101\u1e47i bh\u016bt\u0101ni: any living\nentity who has come in contact with matter, beginning from the first created\nbeing, Brahm\u0101, down to a small ant, is changing its body; therefore they are all\nfallible. In the spiritual world, however, they are always liberated in oneness.",

It is clearly stated there that above the innumerable living entities,\nsome of whom are conditioned and some of whom are liberated, there is the\nSupreme Personality who is Param\u0101tm\u0101. The Upanisadic verse runs as follows:\nnityo nity\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 cetana\u015b cetan\u0101n\u0101m. The purport is that amongst all the living\nentities, both conditioned and liberated, there is one supreme living\npersonality, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who maintains them and gives\nthem all the facility of enjoyment according to different work. That Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead is situated in everyone\u2019s heart as Param\u0101tm\u0101. A wise man\nwho can understand Him is eligible to attain the perfect peace, not others.  It is incorrect to think of the Supreme Lord and the living entities as being on\nthe same level or equal in all respects. There is always the question of\nsuperiority and inferiority in their personalities. This particular word uttama\nis very significant. No one can surpass the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Loke\nis also significant because in the Pauru\u1e63a, a Vedic literature, it is stated:\nlokyate ved\u0101rtho \u2019nena. This Supreme Lord in His localized aspect as Param\u0101tm\u0101\nexplains the purpose of the Vedas. The following verse also appears in the\nVedas:  t\u0101vad e\u1e63a sampras\u0101do \u2019sm\u0101c char\u012br\u0101t samutth\u0101ya para\u1e41 jyoti-r\u016bpa\u1e41 sampadya svena\nr\u016bpe\u1e47\u0101bhini\u1e63padyate sa uttama\u1e25 puru\u1e63a\u1e25  \u201cThe Supersoul coming out of the body enters the impersonal brahmajyoti; then in\nHis form He remains in His spiritual identity. That Supreme is called the\nSupreme Personality.\u201d This means that the Supreme Personality is exhibiting and\ndiffusing His spiritual effulgence, which is the ultimate illumination. That\nSupreme Personality also has a localized aspect as Param\u0101tm\u0101. By incarnating\nHimself as the son of Satyavat\u012b and Par\u0101\u015bara, He explains the Vedic knowledge as\nVy\u0101sadeva.",

Now in this verse the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead clearly explains that anyone who knows Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nas the Supreme Person is actually the knower of everything. The imperfect knower\ngoes on simply speculating about the Absolute Truth, but the perfect knower,\nwithout wasting his valuable time, engages directly in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, the\ndevotional service of the Supreme Lord. Throughout the whole of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101,\nthis fact is being stressed at every step. And still there are so many stubborn\ncommentators on Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 who consider the Supreme Absolute Truth and the\nliving entities to be one and the same.  Vedic knowledge is called \u015bruti learning by aural reception. One should actually\nreceive the Vedic message from authorities like K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and His representatives.\nHere K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a distinguishes everything very nicely, and one should hear from this\nsource. Simply to hear like the hogs is not sufficient; one must be able to\nunderstand from the authorities. It is not that one should simply speculate\nacademically. One should submissively hear from Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that these living\nentities are always subordinate to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Anyone\nwho is able to understand this, according to the Supreme Personality of Godhead,\n\u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, knows the purpose of the Vedas; no one else knows the purpose of the\nVedas.  The word bhajate is very significant. In many places the word bhajate is\nexpressed in relationship with the service of the Supreme Lord. If a person is\nengaged in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness in devotional service of the Lord, it is to\nbe understood that he has understood all the Vedic knowledge. In the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava\nparampar\u0101 it is said that if one is engaged in the devotional service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a,\nthen there is no need for a spiritual process to understand the Supreme Absolute\nTruth. He has already come to the post because he is engaged in the devotional\nservice of the Lord. He has ended all preliminary processes of understanding;\nsimilarly, if anyone, after speculating for hundreds of thousands of lives, does\nnot come to the point that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and that\none has to surrender there, all his speculation for so many years and lives is a\nuseless waste of time.",

TRANSLATION  This is the most confidential part of the Vedic scriptures, O sinless one, and\nit is disclosed now by Me. Whoever understands this will become wise, and his\nendeavors will know perfection.  PURPORT  The Lord clearly explains here that this is the substance of all revealed\nscriptures. And one should understand this as it is given by the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead. Thus one will become intelligent and perfect in\ntranscendental knowledge. In other words, by understanding this philosophy of\nthe Supreme Personality of Godhead and engaging in His transcendental service,\neveryone can become freed from all contaminations of the modes of material\nnature. Devotional service is a process of spiritual understanding. Wherever\ndevotional service exists, the material contamination cannot coexist. Devotional\nservice to the Lord and the Lord Himself are one and the same because they are\nspiritual\u2014the internal energy of the Supreme Lord. The Lord is said to be the\nsun, and ignorance is called darkness. Where the sun is present, there is no\nquestion of darkness. Therefore, whenever devotional service is present under\nthe proper guidance of a bona fide spiritual master, there is no question of\nignorance.  Everyone must take to this consciousness of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and engage in devotional\nservice to become intelligent and purified. Unless one comes to this position of\nunderstanding K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and engages in devotional service, however intelligent he\nmay be in the estimation of some common man, he is not perfectly intelligent.  The word anagha, by which Arjuna is addressed, is significant. Anagha, O sinless\none, means that unless one is free from all sinful reactions, it is very\ndifficult to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. One has to become free from all contamination,\nall sinful activities; then he can understand. But devotional service is so pure\nand potent that once one is engaged in devotional service he automatically comes\nto the stage of sinlessness.  While performing devotional service in the association of pure devotees in full\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, there are certain things which require to be vanquished\naltogether. The most important thing one has to surmount is weakness of the\nheart. The first falldown is caused by the desire to lord it over material\nnature. Thus one gives up the transcendental loving service of the Supreme Lord.\nThe second weakness of the heart is that as one increases the propensity of\nlording it over material nature, he becomes attached to matter and the\npossession of matter. The problems of material existence are due to these\nweaknesses of the heart.",

The extra roots coming out of it were compared to the\nactivities of the living entities, some auspicious, some inauspicious. In the\nNinth Chapter, also, the devas, or godly, and the asuras, the ungodly, or\ndemons, were explained. Now, according to Vedic rites, activities in the mode of\ngoodness are considered auspicious for progress on the path of liberation, and\nsuch activities are known as deva prak\u1e5bti, transcendental by nature. Those who\nare situated in the transcendental nature make progress on the path of\nliberation. For those who are acting in the modes of passion and ignorance, on\nthe other hand, there is no possibility of liberation. Either they will have to\n\n\nremain in this material world as human beings, or they will descend among the\nspecies of animals or even lower life forms. In this Sixteenth Chapter the Lord\nexplains both the transcendental nature and its attendant qualities, as well as\nthe demoniac nature and its qualities. He also explains the advantages and\ndisadvantages of these qualities.\n\n\nThe word abhij\u0101tasya in reference to one born of transcendental qualities or\ngodly tendencies is very significant. To beget a child in a godly atmosphere is\nknown in the Vedic scriptures as Garbh\u0101dh\u0101na-sa\u1e41sk\u0101ra. If the parents want a\nchild in the godly qualities they should follow the ten principles of the human\nbeing. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 we have studied also before that sex life for begetting\na good child is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself. Sex life is not condemned provided the process is\nused in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Those who are in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness at least\nshould not beget children like cats and dogs but should beget them so they may\nbecome K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious after birth. That should be the advantage of children\nborn of a father or mother absorbed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\n\n\nThe social institution known as var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma\u2014the institution dividing\nsociety into four divisions or castes\u2014is not meant to divide human society\naccording to birth. Such divisions are in terms of educational qualifications.\nThey are to keep the society in a state of peace and prosperity. The qualities\nmentioned herein are explained as transcendental qualities meant for making a\nperson progress in spiritual understanding so he can get liberated from the\nmaterial world. In the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama institution the sanny\u0101s\u012b, or the person in the\nrenounced order of life, is considered to be the head or the spiritual master of\nall the social statuses and orders. A br\u0101hma\u1e47a is considered to be the spiritual\nmaster of the three other sections of a society, namely, the k\u1e63atriyas, the\nvai\u015byas and the \u015b\u016bdras, but a sanny\u0101s\u012b, who is on the top of the institution, is\nconsidered to be the spiritual master of the br\u0101hma\u1e47as also. For a sanny\u0101s\u012b, the\nfirst qualification should be fearlessness. Because a sanny\u0101s\u012b has to be alone\nwithout any support or guarantee of support, he has simply to depend on the\nmercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If he thinks, \u201cAfter leaving my\nconnections, who will protect me?\u201d he should not accept the renounced order of\nlife. One must be fully convinced that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead in His localized aspect as Param\u0101tm\u0101 is always within, that He is seeing\neverything and He always knows what one intends to do. One must thus have firm\nconviction that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as Param\u0101tm\u0101 will take care of a soul surrendered to Him.\n\u201cI shall never be alone,\u201d one should think. \u201cEven if I live in the darkest\nregions of a forest I shall be accompanied by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and He will give me all\nprotection.\u201d That conviction is called abhayam, without fear. This state of mind\nis necessary for a person in the renounced order of life. Then he has to purify\nhis existence. There are so many rules and regulations to be followed in the\nrenounced order of life. Most important of all, a sanny\u0101s\u012b is strictly forbidden\nto have any intimate relationship with a woman. He is even forbidden to talk\nwith a woman in a secluded place. Lord Caitanya was an ideal sanny\u0101s\u012b, and when\nHe was at Pur\u012b His feminine devotees could not even come near to offer their\nrespects. They were advised to bow down from a distant place. This is not a sign\nof hatred for women as a class, but it is a stricture imposed on the sanny\u0101s\u012b\nnot to have close connections with women. One has to follow the rules and\nregulations of a particular status of life in order to purify his existence. For\na sanny\u0101s\u012b, intimate relations with women and possessions of wealth for sense\ngratification are strictly forbidden. The ideal sanny\u0101s\u012b was Lord Caitanya\nHimself, and we can learn from His life that He was very strict in regards to\nwomen. Although He is considered to be the most liberal incarnation of Godhead,\naccepting the most fallen conditioned souls, He strictly followed the rules and\nregulations of the sanny\u0101sa order of the life in connection with association\nwith woman. One of His personal associates, namely Cho\u1e6da Harid\u0101sa, was\npersonally associated with Lord Caitanya, along with His other confidential\npersonal associates, but somehow or other this Cho\u1e6da Harid\u0101sa looked lustily on\na young woman, and Lord Caitanya was so strict that He at once rejected him from\nthe society of His personal associates. Lord Caitanya said, \u201cFor a sanny\u0101s\u012b or\nanyone who is aspiring to get out of the clutches of material nature and trying\nto elevate himself to the spiritual nature and go back to home, back to Godhead,\nfor him, looking toward material possessions and women for sense\ngratification\u2014not even enjoying them, but just looking toward them with such a\npropensity\u2014is so condemned that he had better commit suicide before experiencing\nsuch illicit desires.\u201d So these are the processes for purification.\n\n\nThe next item is j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga-vyavasthiti\u1e25: being engaged in the cultivation of\nknowledge. Sanny\u0101s\u012b life is meant for distributing knowledge to the householders\nand others who have forgotten their real life of spiritual advancement. A\nsanny\u0101s\u012b is supposed to beg from door to door for his livelihood, but this does\nnot mean that he is a beggar. Humility is also one of the qualifications of a\ntranscendentally situated person, and out of sheer humility the sanny\u0101s\u012b goes\nfrom door to door, not exactly for the purpose of begging, but to see the\nhouseholders and awaken them to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. This is the duty of a\nsanny\u0101s\u012b. If he is actually advanced and so ordered by his spiritual master, he\nshould preach K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a with logic and understanding, and if he is not so advanced\nhe should not accept the renounced order of life. But even if he has accepted\nthe renounced order of life without sufficient knowledge, he should engage\nhimself fully in hearing from a bona fide spiritual master to cultivate\nknowledge. A sanny\u0101s\u012b or one in the renounced order of life must be situated in\nfearlessness, sattva-sa\u1e41\u015buddhi\u1e25 (purity) and j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga (knowledge).\n\n\nThe next item is charity. Charity is meant for the householders. The\nhouseholders should earn a livelihood by an honorable means and spend fifty\npercent of their income to propagate K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness all over the world.\nThus a householder should give in charity to such institutional societies that\nare engaged in that way. Charity should be given to the right receiver. There\nare different kinds of charities, as will be explained later on, charity in the\nmodes of goodness, passion and ignorance. Charity in the mode of goodness is\nrecommended by the scriptures, but charity in the modes of passion and ignorance\nis not recommended because it is simply a waste of money. Charity should be\ngiven only to propagate K\u1e5bsna consciousness all over the world. That is charity\nin the mode of goodness.\n\n\nThen as far as dama\u1e25 (self-control) is concerned, it is not only meant for other\norders of religious society, but it is especially meant for the householder.\nAlthough he has a wife, a householder should not use his senses for sex life\nunnecessarily. There are restrictions for the householders even in sex life,\nwhich should only be engaged in for the propagation of children. If he does not\nrequire children, he should not enjoy sex life with his wife. Modern society\nenjoys sex life with contraceptive methods or more abominable methods to avoid\nthe responsibility of children. This is not in the transcendental quality but is\ndemoniac. If anyone, even if he is a householder, wants to make progress in\nspiritual life, he must control his sex life and should not beget a child\nwithout the purpose of serving K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. If he is able to beget children who will\nbe in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, one can produce hundreds of children, but without\nthis capacity one should not indulge only for sense pleasure.\n\n\nSacrifice is another item to be performed by the householders because sacrifices\nrequire a large amount of money. Other orders of life, namely the brahmacarya,\nthe v\u0101naprastha and sanny\u0101sa, have no money; they live by begging. So\nperformance of different types of sacrifice is meant for the householder. They\nshould perform agni-hotra sacrifices as enjoined in the Vedic literature, but\nsuch sacrifices at the present moment are very expensive, and it is not possible\nfor any householder to perform them. The best sacrifice recommended in this age\nis called sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-yaj\u00f1a, the chanting of Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a,\nHare Hare/Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare. This is the best and most\ninexpensive sacrifice; everyone can adopt it and derive benefit. So these three\nitems, namely charity, sense control and performance of sacrifice, are meant for\nthe householder.\n\n\nThen sv\u0101dhy\u0101ya\u1e25, Vedic study, and tapas, austerity, and \u0101rjavam, gentleness or\nsimplicity, are meant for the brahmacarya or student life. Brahmac\u0101r\u012bs should\nhave no connection with women; they should live a life of celibacy and engage\nthe mind in the study of Vedic literature for cultivation of spiritual\nknowledge. This is called sv\u0101dhy\u0101ya\u1e25. Tapas or austerity is especially meant for\nthe retired life. One should not remain a householder throughout his whole life;\nhe must always remember that there are four divisions of life, brahmacarya,\ng\u1e5bhastha, v\u0101naprastha and sanny\u0101sa. So after g\u1e5bhastha, householder life, one\nshould retire. If one lives for a hundred years, he should spend twenty-five\nyears in student life, twenty-five in householder life, twenty-five in retired\nlife and twenty-five in the renounced order of life. These are the regulations\nof the Vedic religious discipline. A man retired from household life must\npractice austerities of the body, mind and tongue. That is tapasy\u0101. The entire\nvar\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma society is meant for tapasy\u0101. Without tapasy\u0101 or austerity no\nhuman being can get liberation. The theory that there is no need of austerity in\nlife, that one can go on speculating and everything will be nice, is neither\nrecommended in the Vedic literature nor in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Such theories are\nmanufactured by showbottle spiritualists who are trying to gather more\nfollowers. If there are restrictions, rules and regulations, people will not\nbecome attracted. Therefore those who want followers in the name of religion,\njust to have a show only, don\u2019t restrict the lives of their students nor their\nown lives. But that method is not approved by the Vedas.\n\n\nAs far as simplicity is concerned, not only should a particular order of life\nfollow this principle, but every member, be he in the brahmacarya-\u0101\u015brama, or\ng\u1e5bhastha-\u0101\u015brama or v\u0101naprastha-\u0101\u015brama. One must live very simply.\n\n\nAhi\u1e41s\u0101 means not arresting the progressive life of any living entity. One should\nnot think that since the spirit spark is never killed even after the killing of\nthe body there is no harm in killing animals for sense gratification. People are\nnow addicted to eating animals, in spite of having an ample supply of grains,\nfruits and milk. There is no necessity for animal killing. This injunction is\nfor everyone. When there is no other alternative, one may kill an animal, but it\nshould be offered in sacrifice. At any rate, when there is an ample food supply\nfor humanity, persons who are desiring to make advancement in spiritual\nrealization should not commit violence to animals. Real ahi\u1e41s\u0101 means not\nchecking anyone\u2019s progressive life. The animals are also making progress in\ntheir evolutionary life by transmigrating from one category of animal life to\nanother. If a particular animal is killed, then his progress is checked. If an\nanimal is staying in a particular body for so many days or so many years and is\nuntimely killed, then he has to come back again in that form of life to complete\nthe remaining days in order to be promoted to another species of life. So their\nprogress should not be checked simply to satisfy one\u2019s palate. This is called\nahi\u1e41s\u0101.\n\n\nSatyam. This word means that one should not distort the truth for some personal\ninterest. In Vedic literature there are some difficult passages, but the meaning\nor the purpose should be learned from a bona fide spiritual master. That is the\nprocess for understanding Vedas. \u015aruti means that one should hear from the\nauthority. One should not construe some interpretation for his personal\ninterest. There are so many commentaries on Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that misinterpret the\noriginal text. The real import of the word should be presented, and that should\nbe learned from a bona fide spiritual master.\n\n\nAkrodha\u1e25 means to check anger. Even if there is provocation one should be\ntolerant, for once one becomes angry his whole body becomes polluted. Anger is\nthe product of the modes of passion and lust, so one who is transcendentally\nsituated should check himself from anger. Apai\u015bunam means that one should not\nfind fault with others or correct them unnecessarily. Of course to call a thief\na thief is not faultfinding, but to call an honest person a thief is very much\noffensive for one who is making advancement in spiritual life. Hr\u012b\u1e25 means that\none should be very modest and must not perform some act which is abominable.\nAc\u0101palam, determination, means that one should not be agitated or frustrated in\nsome attempt. There may be failure in some attempt, but one should not be sorry\nfor that; he should make progress with patience and determination. The word\nteja\u1e25 used here is meant for the k\u1e63atriyas. The k\u1e63atriyas should always be very\nstrong to be able to give protection to the weak. They should not pose\nthemselves as nonviolent. If violence is required, they must exhibit it.\n\n\n\u015aaucam means cleanliness, not only in mind and body but in one\u2019s dealings also.\nIt is especially meant for the mercantile people, who should not deal in the\nblack market. N\u0101tim\u0101nit\u0101, not expecting honor, applies to the \u015b\u016bdras, the worker\nclass, which are considered, according to Vedic injunctions, to be the lowest of\nthe four classes. They should not be puffed up with unnecessary prestige or\nhonor and should remain in their own status. It is the duty of the \u015b\u016bdras to\noffer respect to the higher class for the upkeep of the social order.\n\n\nAll these sixteen qualifications mentioned are transcendental qualities. They\nshould be cultivated according to the different statuses of the social order.\nThe purport is that even though material conditions are miserable, if these\nqualities are developed by practice, by all classes of men, then gradually it is\npossible to rise to the highest platform of transcendental realization.\n\n\n16.4\n\n\ndambho darpo \u2019bhim\u0101na\u015b ca\n\n\nkrodha\u1e25 p\u0101ru\u1e63yam eva ca\n\n\naj\u00f1\u0101na\u1e41 c\u0101bhij\u0101tasya\n\n\np\u0101rtha sampadam \u0101sur\u012bm\n\n\ndambha\u1e25\u2014pride; darpa\u1e25\u2014arrogance; abhim\u0101na\u1e25\u2014conceit; ca\u2014and; kroda\u1e25\u2014anger;\np\u0101ru\u1e63yam\u2014harshness; eva\u2014certainly; ca\u2014and; aj\u00f1\u0101nam\u2014ignorance; ca\u2014and;\nabhij\u0101tasya\u2014one who is born; p\u0101rtha\u2014O son of P\u1e5bth\u0101; sampadam\u2014nature;\n\u0101sur\u012bm\u2014demoniac.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nArrogance, pride, anger, conceit, harshness and ignorance\u2014these qualities belong\nto those of demonic nature, O son of P\u1e5bth\u0101.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nIn this verse, the royal road to hell is described. The demoniac want to make a\nshow of religion and advancement in spiritual science, although they do not\nfollow the principles. They are always arrogant or proud in possessing some type\nof education or so much wealth. They desire to be worshiped by others, and\ndemand respectability, although they do not command respect. Over trifles they\nbecome very angry and speak harshly, not gently. They do not know what should be\ndone and what should not be done. They do everything whimsically, according to\ntheir own desire, and they do not recognize any authority. These demoniac\nqualities are taken on by them from the beginning of their bodies in the wombs\nof their mothers, and as they grow they manifest all these inauspicious\nqualities.\n\n\n16.5\n\n\ndaiv\u012b sampad vimok\u1e63\u0101ya\n\n\nnibandh\u0101y\u0101sur\u012b mat\u0101\n\n\nm\u0101 \u015buca\u1e25 sampada\u1e41 daiv\u012bm\n\n\nabhij\u0101to \u2019si p\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dava\n\n\ndaiv\u012b\u2014transcendental; sampat\u2014nature; vimok\u1e63\u0101ya\u2014meant for liberation;\nnibandh\u0101ya\u2014for bondage; \u0101sur\u012b\u2014demoniac qualities; mat\u0101\u2014it is considered; m\u0101\u2014do\nnot; \u015buca\u1e25\u2014worry; sampadam\u2014nature; daiv\u012bm\u2014transcendental; abhij\u0101ta\u1e25\u2014born;\nasi\u2014you are; p\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dava\u2014O son of P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThe transcendental qualities are conducive to liberation, whereas the demonic\nqualities make for bondage.

His involvement in the fight was not demoniac because he was\nconsidering the pro\u2019s and con\u2019s. He was considering whether respectable persons\nsuch as Bh\u012b\u1e63ma and Dro\u1e47a should be killed or not, so he was not acting under the\ninfluence of anger, false prestige, or harshness. Therefore he was not of the\nquality of the demons. For a k\u1e63atriya, a military man, shooting arrows at the\nenemy is considered transcendental, and refraining from such a duty is demoniac.\nTherefore, there was no cause for Arjuna to lament. Anyone who performs the\nregulated principles of the different orders of life is transcendentally\nsituated.\n\n\n16.6\n\n\ndvau bh\u016bta-sargau loke \u2019smin\n\n\ndaiva \u0101sura eva ca\n\n\ndaivo vistara\u015ba\u1e25 prokta\n\n\n\u0101sura\u1e41 p\u0101rtha me \u015b\u1e5b\u1e47u\n\n\ndvau\u2014two; bh\u016bta-sargau\u2014created living beings; loke\u2014in this world; asmin\u2014this;\ndaiva\u1e25\u2014godly; \u0101sura\u1e25\u2014demoniac; eva\u2014certainly; ca\u2014and; daiva\u1e25\u2014divine;\nvistara\u015ba\u1e25\u2014at great length; prokta\u1e25\u2014said; asuram\u2014demoniac; p\u0101rtha\u2014O son of\nP\u1e5bth\u0101; me\u2014from Me; \u015b\u1e5b\u1e47u\u2014just hear.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nO son of P\u1e5bth\u0101, in this world there are two kinds of created beings.

Now hear from Me of the demoniac.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nLord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, having assured Arjuna that he was born with the divine qualities, is\nnow describing the demoniac way. The conditioned living entities are divided\ninto two classes in this world. Those who are born with divine qualities follow\na regulated life; that is to say they abide by the injunctions in scriptures and\nby the authorities. One should perform duties in the light of authoritative\nscripture. This mentality is called divine. One who does not follow the\nregulative principles as they are laid down in the scriptures and who acts\naccording to his whims is called demoniac or asuric. There is no other criterion\nbut obedience to the regulative principles of scriptures. It is mentioned in\nVedic literature that both the demigods and the demons are born of the\nPraj\u0101pati; the only difference is that one class obeys the Vedic injunctions and\nthe other does not.\n\n\n16.7\n\n\nprav\u1e5btti\u1e41 ca niv\u1e5btti\u1e41 ca\n\n\njan\u0101 na vidur \u0101sur\u0101\u1e25\n\n\nna \u015bauca\u1e41 n\u0101pi c\u0101c\u0101ro\n\n\nna satya\u1e41 te\u1e63u vidyate\n\n\nprav\u1e5bttim\u2014proper action; ca\u2014also; niv\u1e5bttim\u2014improper action; ca\u2014and;\njan\u0101\u1e25\u2014persons; na\u2014never; vidu\u1e25\u2014know; \u0101sur\u0101\u1e25\u2014in demoniac quality; na\u2014never;\n\u015baucam\u2014cleanliness; na\u2014nor; api\u2014also; ca\u2014and; \u0101c\u0101ra\u1e25\u2014behavior; na\u2014never;\nsatyam\u2014truth; te\u1e63u\u2014in them; vidyate\u2014there is.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThose who are demoniac do not know what is to be done and what is not to be\ndone. Neither cleanliness nor proper behavior nor truth is found in them.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nIn every civilized human society there is some set of scriptural rules and\nregulations which are followed from the beginning, especially among the \u0100ryans,\nthose who adopt the Vedic civilization and who are known as the most advanced\ncivilized peoples. Those who do not follow the scriptural injunctions are\nsupposed to be demons. Therefore it is stated here that the demons do not know\nthe scriptural rules, nor do they have any inclination to follow them. Most of\nthem do not know them, and even if some of them know, they have not the tendency\nto follow them. They have no faith, nor are they willing to act in terms of the\nVedic injunctions. The demons are not clean, either externally or internally.\n\n\nOne should always be careful to keep his body clean by bathing, brushing teeth,\nchanging clothes, etc. As far as internal cleanliness is concerned, one should\nalways remember the holy names of God and chant Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare. The demons neither\nlike nor follow all these rules for external and internal cleanliness.\n\n\nAs for behavior, there are many rules and regulations guiding human behavior,\nsuch as the Manu-sa\u1e41hit\u0101, which is the law of the human race. Even up to today,\nthose who are Hindu follow the Manu-sa\u1e41hit\u0101. Laws of inheritance and other\nlegalities are derived from this book. Now, in the Manu-sa\u1e41hit\u0101, it is clearly\nstated that a woman should not be given freedom. That does not mean that women\nare to be kept as slaves, but they are like children. Children are not given\nfreedom, but that does not mean that they are kept as slaves. The demons have\nnow neglected such injunctions, and they think that women should be given as\nmuch freedom as men. However, this has not improved the social condition of the\nworld. Actually, a woman should be given protection at every stage of life. She\nshould be given protection by the father in her younger days, by the husband in\nher youth, and by the grownup sons in her old age. This is proper social\nbehavior according to the Manu-sa\u1e41hit\u0101. But modern education has artificially\ndevised a puffed up concept of womanly life, and therefore marriage is\npractically now an imagination in human society. Nor is the moral condition of\nwoman very good now. The demons, therefore, do not accept any instruction which\nis good for society, and because they do not follow the experience of great\nsages and the rules and regulations laid down by the sages, the social condition\nof the demoniac people is very miserable.\n\n\n16.8\n\n\nasatyam aprati\u1e63\u1e6dha\u1e41 te\n\n\njagad \u0101hur an\u012b\u015bvaram\n\n\naparaspara-sambh\u016bta\u1e41\n\n\nkim anyat k\u0101ma-haitukam\n\n\nasatyam\u2014unreal; aprati\u1e63\u1e6dham\u2014without foundation; te\u2014they; jagat\u2014the cosmic\nmanifestation; \u0101hu\u1e25\u2014is said; an\u012b\u015bvaram\u2014with no controller; aparaspara\u2014by mutual\nlust; sambh\u016btam\u2014caused; kim anyat\u2014there is no other cause; k\u0101ma-haitukam\u2014it is\ndue to lust only.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThey say that this world is unreal, that there is no foundation and that there\nis no God in control. It is produced of sex desire, and has no cause other than\nlust.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe demoniac conclude that the world is phantasmagoria. There is no cause, no\neffect, no controller, no purpose: everything is unreal. They say that this\ncosmic manifestation arises due to chance material actions and reactions. They\ndo not think that the world was created by God for a certain purpose. They have\ntheir own theory: that the world has come about in its own way and that there is\nno reason to believe that there is a God behind it. For them there is no\ndifference between spirit and matter, and they do not accept the Supreme Spirit.\nEverything is matter only, and the whole cosmos is supposed to be a mass of\nignorance. According to them, everything is void, and whatever manifestation\nexists is due to our ignorance in perception. They take it for granted that all\nmanifestation of diversity is a display of ignorance. Just as in a dream we may\ncreate so many things, which actually have no existence, so when we are awake we\nshall see that everything is simply a dream. But factually, although the demons\nsay that life is a dream, they are very expert in enjoying this dream. And so,\ninstead of acquiring knowledge, they become more and more implicated in their\ndreamland. They conclude that as a child is simply the result of sexual\nintercourse between man and woman, this world is born without any soul. For them\nit is only a combination of matter that has produced the living entities, and\nthere is no question of the existence of the soul. As many living creatures come\nout from perspiration and from a dead body without any cause, similarly, the\nwhole living world has come out of the material combinations of the cosmic\nmanifestation. Therefore material nature is the cause of this manifestation, and\nthere is no other cause. They do not believe in the words of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101: may\u0101dhyak\u1e63e\u1e47a prak\u1e5bti\u1e25 s\u016byate sa-car\u0101caram. \u201cUnder My direction\nthe whole material world is moving.\u201d In other words, amongst the demons there is\nno perfect knowledge of the creation of this world; every one of them has some\nparticular theory of his own. According to them, one interpretation of the\nscriptures is as good as another, for they do not believe in a standard\nunderstanding of the scriptural injunctions.\n\n\n16.9\n\n\net\u0101\u1e41 d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dim ava\u1e63\u1e6dabhya\n\n\nna\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101tm\u0101no \u2019lpa-buddhaya\u1e25\n\n\nprabhavanty ugra-karm\u0101\u1e47a\u1e25\n\n\nk\u1e63ay\u0101ya jagato \u2019hit\u0101\u1e25\n\n\net\u0101m\u2014thus; d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dim\u2014vision; ava\u1e63\u1e6dabhya\u2014accepting; na\u1e63\u1e6da\u2014lost; \u0101tm\u0101na\u1e25\u2014self;\nalpa-buddhaya\u1e25\u2014less intelligent; prabhavanti\u2014flourish; ugra-karm\u0101\u1e47a\u1e25\u2014in painful\nactivities; k\u1e63ay\u0101ya\u2014for destruction; jagata\u1e25\u2014of the world; ahit\u0101\u1e25\u2014unbeneficial.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nFollowing such conclusions, the demoniac, who are lost to themselves and who\nhave no intelligence, engage in unbeneficial, horrible works meant to destroy\nthe world.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe demoniac are engaged in activities that will lead the world to destruction.\nThe Lord states here that they are less intelligent. The materialists, who have\nno concept of God, think that they are advancing. But, according to\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, they are unintelligent and devoid of all sense. They try to enjoy\nthis material world to the utmost limit and therefore always engage in inventing\nsomething for sense gratification. Such materialistic inventions are considered\nto be advancement of human civilization, but the result is that people grow more\nand more violent and more and more cruel, cruel to animals and cruel to other\nhuman beings. They have no idea how to behave toward one another. Animal killing\nis very prominent amongst demoniac people. Such people are considered the\nenemies of the world because ultimately they will invent or create something\nwhich will bring destruction to all. Indirectly, this verse anticipates the\ninvention of nuclear weapons, of which the whole world is today very proud. At\nany moment war may take place, and these atomic weapons may create havoc. Such\nthings are created solely for the destruction of the world, and this is\nindicated here. Due to godlessness, such weapons are invented in human society;\nthey are not meant for the peace and prosperity of the world.\n\n\n16.10\n\n\nk\u0101mam \u0101\u015britya du\u1e63p\u016bra\u1e41\n\n\ndambha-m\u0101na-mad\u0101nvit\u0101\u1e25\n\n\nmoh\u0101d g\u1e5bh\u012btv\u0101sad-gr\u0101h\u0101n\n\n\npravartante \u2019\u015buci-vrat\u0101\u1e25\n\n\nk\u0101mam\u2014lust; \u0101\u015britya\u2014taking shelter of; du\u1e63p\u016bram\u2014insatiable; dambha\u2014pride;\nm\u0101na\u2014false prestige; mada-anvit\u0101\u1e25\u2014absorbed in conceit; moh\u0101t\u2014by illusion;\ng\u1e5bh\u012btv\u0101\u2014taking; asat\u2014nonpermanent; gr\u0101h\u0101n\u2014things; pravartante\u2014flourish;\na\u015buci\u2014unclean; vrat\u0101\u1e25\u2014avowed.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThe demoniac, taking shelter of insatiable lust, pride and false prestige, and\nbeing thus illusioned, are always sworn to unclean work, attracted by the\nimpermanent.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe demoniac mentality is described here. The demons\u2019 lust is never satiated.\nThey will go on increasing and increasing their insatiable desires for material\nenjoyment. Although they are always full of anxieties on account of accepting\nnonpermanent things, they still continue to engage in such activities out of\nillusion. They have no knowledge and cannot tell that they are heading the wrong\nway. Accepting nonpermanent things, such demoniac people create their own God,\ncreate their own hymns and chant accordingly. The result is that they become\nmore and more attracted to two things\u2014sex enjoyment and accumulation of material\nwealth. The word a\u015buci-vrat\u0101\u1e25, unclean vow, is very significant in this\nconnection. Such demoniac people are only attracted by wine, women, gambling and\nmeat eating; those are their a\u015buci, unclean habits. Induced by pride and false\nprestige, they create some principles of religion which are not approved by the\nVedic injunctions. Although such demoniac people are most abominable in the\nworld, still, by artificial means, the world creates a false honor for them.\nAlthough they are gliding toward hell, they consider themselves very much\nadvanced.\n\n\n16.11-12\n\n\ncint\u0101m aparimey\u0101\u1e41 ca\n\n\npralay\u0101nt\u0101m up\u0101\u015brit\u0101\u1e25\n\n\nk\u0101mopabhoga-param\u0101\n\n\net\u0101vad iti ni\u015bcit\u0101\u1e25\n\n\n\u0101\u015b\u0101-p\u0101\u015ba-\u015batair baddh\u0101\u1e25\n\n\nk\u0101ma-krodha-par\u0101ya\u1e47\u0101\u1e25\n\n\n\u012bhante k\u0101ma-bhog\u0101rtham\n\n\nany\u0101yen\u0101rtha-sa\u00f1cay\u0101n\n\n\ncint\u0101m\u2014fears and anxieties; aparimey\u0101m\u2014unmeasurable; ca\u2014and; pralaya-ant\u0101m\u2014unto\nthe point of death; up\u0101\u015brit\u0101\u1e25\u2014having taken shelter of them; k\u0101ma-upabhoga\u2014sense\ngratification; param\u0101\u1e25\u2014the highest goal of life; et\u0101vat\u2014thus; iti\u2014in this way;\nni\u015bcit\u0101\u1e25\u2014ascertain; \u0101\u015b\u0101-p\u0101\u015ba\u2014entanglement in the network of hope; \u015batai\u1e25\u2014by\nhundreds; baddh\u0101\u1e25\u2014being bound; k\u0101ma\u2014lust; krodha\u2014anger; par\u0101ya\u1e47\u0101\u1e25\u2014always\nsituated in that mentality; \u012bhante\u2014desire; k\u0101ma\u2014lust; bhoga\u2014sense enjoyment;\nartham\u2014for that purpose; any\u0101yena\u2014illegally; artha\u2014wealth; sa\u00f1cay\u0101n\u2014accumulate.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThey believe that to gratify the senses unto the end of life is the prime\nnecessity of human civilization. Thus there is no end to their anxiety. Being\nbound by hundreds and thousands of desires, by lust and anger, they secure money\nby illegal means for sense gratification.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe demoniac accept that the enjoyment of the senses is the ultimate goal of\nlife, and this concept they maintain until death. They do not believe in life\nafter death, and they do not believe that one takes on different types of bodies\naccording to one\u2019s karma, or activities in this world. Their plans for life are\nnever finished, and they go on preparing plan after plan, all of which are never\nfinished. We have personal experience of a person of such demoniac mentality,\nwho, even at the point of death, was requesting the physician to prolong his\nlife for four years more because his plans were not yet complete. Such foolish\npeople do not know that a physician cannot prolong life even for a moment. When\nthe notice is there, there is no consideration of the man\u2019s desire. The laws of\nnature do not allow a second beyond what one is destined to enjoy.\n\n\nThe demoniac person, who has no faith in God or the Supersoul within himself,\nperforms all kinds of sinful activities simply for sense gratification. He does\nnot know that there is a witness sitting within his heart. The Supersoul is\nobserving the activities of the individual soul. As it is stated in the Vedic\nliterature, the Upani\u1e63ads, there are two birds sitting in one tree; the one is\nacting and enjoying or suffering the fruits of the branches, and the other is\nwitnessing. But one who is demoniac has no knowledge of Vedic scripture, nor has\nhe any faith; therefore he feels free to do anything for sense enjoyment,\nregardless of the consequences.\n\n\n16.13-15\n\n\nidam adya may\u0101 labdham\n\n\nima\u1e41 pr\u0101psye manoratham\n\n\nidam ast\u012bdam api me\n\n\nbhavi\u1e63yati punar dhanam\n\n\nasau may\u0101 hata\u1e25 \u015batrur\n\n\nhani\u1e63ye c\u0101par\u0101n api\n\n\n\u012b\u015bvaro \u2019ham aha\u1e41 bhog\u012b\n\n\nsiddho \u2019ha\u1e41 balav\u0101n sukh\u012b\n\n\n\u0101\u1e0dhyo \u2019bhijanav\u0101n asmi\n\n\nko \u2019nyo \u2019sti sad\u1e5b\u015bo may\u0101\n\n\nyak\u1e63ye d\u0101sy\u0101mi modi\u1e63ya\n\n\nity aj\u00f1\u0101na-vimohit\u0101\u1e25\n\n\nidam\u2014this; adya\u2014today; may\u0101\u2014by me; labdham\u2014gained; imam\u2014this; pr\u0101psye\u2014I shall\ngain; manoratham\u2014according to my desires; idam\u2014this; asti\u2014there is; idam\u2014this;\napi\u2014also; me\u2014mine; bhavi\u1e63yati\u2014will increase in the future; puna\u1e25\u2014again;\ndhanam\u2014wealth; asau\u2014that; may\u0101\u2014by me; hata\u1e25\u2014has been killed; \u015batru\u1e25\u2014enemy;\nhani\u1e63ye\u2014I shall kill; ca\u2014also; apar\u0101n\u2014others; api\u2014certainly; \u012b\u015bvara\u1e25\u2014the lord;\naham\u2014I am; aham\u2014I am; bhog\u012b\u2014the enjoyer; siddhah\u2014perfect; aham\u2014I am;\nbalav\u0101n\u2014powerful; sukh\u012b\u2014happy; \u0101\u1e0dhya\u1e25\u2014wealthy; abhijanav\u0101n\u2014surrounded by\naristocratic relatives; asmi\u2014I am; ka\u1e25\u2014who else; anya\u1e25\u2014other; asti\u2014there is;\nsad\u1e5b\u015ba\u1e25\u2014like; may\u0101\u2014me; yak\u1e63ye\u2014I shall sacrifice; d\u0101sy\u0101mi\u2014I shall give in\ncharity; modi\u1e63ye\u2014I shall rejoice; iti\u2014thus; aj\u00f1\u0101na\u2014ignorance; vimohit\u0101\u1e25\u2014deluded\nby.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThe demoniac person thinks: \u201cSo much wealth do I have today, and I will gain\nmore according to my schemes.

That is\nunlimited. He only thinks how much assessment he has just now and schemes to\nengage that stock of wealth farther and farther. For that reason, he does not\nhesitate to act in any sinful way and so deals in the black market for illegal\ngratification. He is enamoured by the possessions he has already, such as land,\nfamily, house and bank balance, and he is always planning to improve them. He\nbelieves in his own strength, and he does not know that whatever he is gaining\nis due to his past good deeds. He is given an opportunity to accumulate such\nthings, but he has no conception of past causes. He simply thinks that all his\nmass of wealth is due to his own endeavor. A demoniac person believes in the\nstrength of his personal work, not in the law of karma. According to the law of\nkarma, a man takes his birth in a high family, or becomes rich, or very well\neducated, or very beautiful because of good work in the past. The demoniac\nthinks that all these things are accidental and due to the strength of his\npersonal ability. He does not sense any arrangement behind all the varieties of\npeople, beauty, and education. Anyone who comes into competition with such a\ndemoniac man is his enemy. There are many demoniac people, and each is enemy to\nthe others. This enmity becomes more and more deep\u2014between persons, then between\nfamilies, then between societies, and at last between nations. Therefore there\nis constant strife, war and enmity all over the world.\n\n\nEach demoniac person thinks that he can live at the sacrifice of all others.\nGenerally, a demoniac person thinks of himself as the Supreme God, and a\ndemoniac preacher tells his followers: \u201cWhy are you seeking God elsewhere? You\nare all yourselves God! Whatever you like, you can do. Don\u2019t believe in God.\nThrow away God. God is dead.\u201d These are the demoniac\u2019s preachings.\n\n\nAlthough the demoniac person sees others equally rich and influential, or even\nmore so, he thinks that no one is richer than him and that no one is more\ninfluential than him. As far as promotion to the higher planetary system is\nconcerned, he does not believe in performing yaj\u00f1as or sacrifices. Demons think\nthat they will manufacture their own process of yaj\u00f1a and prepare some machine,\nby which they will be able to reach any higher planet. The best example of such\na demoniac man was R\u0101va\u1e47a. He offered a program to the people by which he would\nprepare a staircase so that anyone could reach the heavenly planets without\nperforming sacrifices, such as are prescribed in the Vedas. Similarly, in the\npresent age such demoniac men are striving to reach the higher planetary systems\nby mechanical arrangement. These are examples of bewilderment. The result is\nthat, without their knowledge, they are gliding toward hell. Here the Sanskrit\nword mohaj\u0101la is very significant. J\u0101la means net; like fishes caught in a net,\nthey have no way to come out.\n\n\n16.17\n\n\n\u0101tma-sambh\u0101vit\u0101\u1e25 stabdh\u0101\n\n\ndhana-m\u0101na-mad\u0101nvit\u0101\u1e25\n\n\nyajante n\u0101ma-yaj\u00f1ais te\n\n\ndambhen\u0101vidhi-p\u016brvakam\n\n\n\u0101tma-sambh\u0101vit\u0101\u1e25\u2014self-complacent; stabdh\u0101\u1e25\u2014impudent; dhana-m\u0101na\u2014wealth and false\nprestige; mada-anvit\u0101\u1e25\u2014absorbed in pride; yajante\u2014perform sacrifices; n\u0101ma\u2014in\nname only; yaj\u00f1ai\u1e25\u2014with such a sacrifice; te\u2014they; dambhena\u2014out of pride;\navidhi-p\u016brvakam\u2014without following any rules and regulations.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nSelf-complacent and always impudent, deluded by wealth and false prestige, they\nsometimes perform sacrifices in name only without following any rules or\nregulations.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThinking themselves all in all, not caring for any authority or scripture, the\ndemoniac sometimes perform so-called religious or sacrificial rites. And since\nthey do not believe in authority, they are very impudent. This is due to\nillusion caused by accumulating some wealth and false prestige. Sometimes such\ndemons take up the role of preacher, mislead the people, and become known as\nreligious reformers or as incarnations of God. They make a show of performing\nsacrifices, or they worship the demigods, or manufacture their own God. Common\nmen advertise them as God and worship them, and by the foolish they are\nconsidered advanced in the principles of religion, or in the principles of\nspiritual knowledge. They take the dress of the renounced order of life and\nengage in all nonsense in that dress. Actually there are so many restrictions\nfor one who has renounced this world. The demons, however, do not care for such\nrestrictions. They think that whatever path one can create is one\u2019s own path;\nthere is no such thing as a standard path one has to follow. The word\navidhi-p\u016brvakam, meaning disregard for the rules and regulations, is especially\nstressed here. These things are always due to ignorance and illusion.\n\n\n16.18\n\n\naha\u1e45k\u0101ra\u1e41 bala\u1e41 darpa\u1e41\n\n\nk\u0101ma\u1e41 krodha\u1e41 ca sa\u1e41\u015brit\u0101\u1e25\n\n\nm\u0101m \u0101tma-para-dehe\u1e63u\n\n\npradvi\u1e63anto \u2019bhyas\u016byak\u0101\u1e25\n\n\naha\u1e45k\u0101ram\u2014false ego; balam\u2014strength; darpam\u2014pride; k\u0101mam\u2014lust; krodham\u2014anger;\nca\u2014also; sa\u1e41\u015brit\u0101\u1e25\u2014having taken shelter of; m\u0101m\u2014Me; \u0101tma\u2014one\u2019s own;\npara-dehe\u1e63u\u2014in other bodies; pradvi\u1e63anta\u1e25\u2014blasphemes; abhyas\u016byak\u0101\u1e25\u2014envious.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nBewildered by false ego, strength, pride, lust and anger, the demon becomes\nenvious of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is situated in his own body\nand in the bodies of others, and blasphemes against the real religion.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nA demoniac person, being always against God\u2019s supremacy, does not like to\nbelieve in the scriptures. He is envious of both the scriptures and of the\nexistence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is caused by his so-called\nprestige and his accumulation of wealth and strength. He does not know that the\npresent life is a preparation for the next life. Not knowing this, he is\nactually envious of his own self, as well as of others. He commits violence on\nother bodies and on his own. He does not care for the supreme control of the\nPersonality of Godhead because he has no knowledge. Being envious of the\nscriptures and the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he puts forward false\narguments against the existence of God and refutes the scriptural authority. He\nthinks himself independant and powerful in every action. He thinks that since no\none can equal him in strength, power, or in wealth, he can act in any way and no\none can stop him.

The\ndemoniac person may not agree to accept the supremacy of the Lord, and it is a\nfact that he may act according to his own whims, but his next birth will depend\nupon the decision of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and not on himself. In\nthe \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, Third Canto, it is stated that an individual soul, after\nhis death, is put into the womb of a mother where he gets a particular type of\nbody under the supervision of superior power. Therefore in the material\nexistence we find so many species of life\u2014animals, insects, men, and so on. All\nare arranged by the superior power. They are not accidental. As for the\ndemoniac, it is clearly said here that they are perpetually put into the wombs\nof demons, and thus they continue to be envious, the lowest of mankind. Such\ndemoniac species of life are held to be always full of lust, always violent and\nhateful and always unclean. They are just like so many beasts in a jungle.\n\n\n16.20\n\n\n\u0101sur\u012b\u1e41 yonim \u0101pann\u0101\n\n\nm\u016b\u1e0dh\u0101 janmani janmani\n\n\nm\u0101m apr\u0101pyaiva kaunteya\n\n\ntato y\u0101nty adham\u0101\u1e41 gatim\n\n\n\u0101sur\u012bm\u2014demoniac; yonim\u2014species; \u0101pann\u0101\u1e25\u2014gaining; m\u016b\u1e0dh\u0101\u1e25\u2014the foolish; janmani\njanmani\u2014in birth after birth; m\u0101m\u2014unto Me; apr\u0101pya\u2014without achieving;\neva\u2014certainly; kaunteya\u2014O son of Kunt\u012b; tata\u1e25\u2014thereafter; y\u0101nti\u2014goes;\nadham\u0101m\u2014condemned; gatim\u2014destination.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nAttaining repeated birth amongst the species of demoniac life, such persons can\nnever approach Me. Gradually they sink down to the most abominable type of\nexistence.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nIt is known that God is all-merciful, but here we find that God is never\nmerciful to the demoniac. It is clearly stated that the demoniac people, life\nafter life, are put into the wombs of similar demons, and, not achieving the\nmercy of the Supreme Lord, they go down and down, so that at last they achieve\nbodies like those of cats, dogs and hogs. It is clearly stated that such demons\nhave practically no chance of receiving the mercy of God at any stage of later\nlife. In the Vedas also it is stated that such persons gradually sink to become\ndogs and hogs. It may be then argued in this connection that God should not be\nadvertised as all-merciful if He is not merciful to such demons. In answer to\nthis question, in the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra we find that the Supreme Lord has no hatred\nfor anyone. The placing of the asuras, the demons, in the lowest status of life\nis simply another feature of His mercy. Sometimes the asuras are killed by the\nSupreme Lord, but this killing is also good for them, for in Vedic literature we\nfind that anyone who is killed by the Supreme Lord becomes liberated. There are\ninstances in history of many asuras\u2014R\u0101va\u1e47a, Ka\u1e41sa, Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu\u2014to whom the\nLord appeared in various incarnations just to kill. Therefore God\u2019s mercy is\nshown to the asuras if they are fortunate enough to be killed by Him.\n\n\n16.21\n\n\ntri-vidha\u1e41 narakasyeda\u1e41\n\n\ndv\u0101ra\u1e41 n\u0101\u015banam \u0101tmana\u1e25\n\n\nk\u0101ma\u1e25 krodhas tath\u0101 lobhas\n\n\ntasm\u0101d etat traya\u1e41 tyajet\n\n\ntri-vidham\u2014three kinds of; narakasya\u2014hellish; idam\u2014this; dv\u0101ram\u2014gate;\nn\u0101\u015banam\u2014destructive; \u0101tmana\u1e25\u2014of the self; k\u0101ma\u1e25\u2014lust; krodha\u1e25\u2014anger; tath\u0101\u2014as\nwell as; lobha\u1e25\u2014greed; tasm\u0101t\u2014therefore; etat\u2014these; trayam\u2014three; tyajet\u2014must\ngive up.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThere are three gates leading to this hell\u2014lust, anger, and greed.

The more a person is freed from lust, anger and greed, the more his\nexistence becomes pure. Then he can follow the rules and regulations enjoined in\nthe Vedic literature. By following the regulative principles of human life, one\ngradually raises himself to the platform of spiritual realization. If one is so\nfortunate, by such practice, to rise to the platform of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness,\nthen success is guaranteed for him. In the Vedic literature, the ways of action\nand reaction are prescribed to enable one to come to the stage of purification.\nThe whole method is based on giving up lust, greed and anger. By cultivating\nknowledge of this process, one can be elevated to the highest position of\nself-realization; this self-realization is perfected in devotional service. In\nthat devotional service, the liberation of the conditioned soul is guaranteed.\nTherefore, according to the Vedic system, there are instituted the four orders\nof life and the four statuses of life, called the caste system and the spiritual\norder system. There are different rules and regulations for different castes or\ndivisions of society, and if a person is able to follow them, he will be\nautomatically raised to the highest platform of spiritual realization. Then he\ncan have liberation without a doubt.\n\n\n16.23\n\n\nya\u1e25 \u015b\u0101stra-vidhim uts\u1e5bjya\n\n\nvartate k\u0101ma-k\u0101rata\u1e25\n\n\nna sa siddhim av\u0101pnoti\n\n\nna sukha\u1e41 na par\u0101\u1e41 gatim\n\n\nya\u1e25\u2014anyone; \u015b\u0101stra-vidhim\u2014the regulations of the scriptures; uts\u1e5bjya\u2014giving up;\nvartate\u2014remains; k\u0101ma-k\u0101rata\u1e25\u2014acting whimsically in lust; na\u2014never; sa\u1e25\u2014he;\nsiddhim\u2014perfection; av\u0101pnoti\u2014achieves; na\u2014never; sukham\u2014happiness; na\u2014never;\npar\u0101m\u2014the supreme; gatim\u2014perfectional stage.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nBut he who discards scriptural injunctions and acts according to his own whims\nattains neither perfection, nor happiness, nor the supreme destination.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nAs described before, the \u015b\u0101stra-vidhim, or the direction of the \u015b\u0101stra, is given\nto the different castes and orders of human society. Everyone is expected to\nfollow these rules and regulations. If one does not follow them and acts\nwhimsically according to his lust, greed and desire, then he never will be\nperfect in his life. In other words, a man may theoretically know all these\nthings, but if he does not apply them in his own life, then he is to be known as\nthe lowest of mankind. In the human form of life, a living entity is expected to\nbe sane and to follow the regulations given for elevating his life to the\nhighest platform, but if he does not follow them, then he degrades himself. But\neven if he follows the rules and regulations and moral principles and ultimately\ndoes not come to the stage of understanding the Supreme Lord, then all his\nknowledge becomes spoiled. Therefore one should gradually raise himself to the\nplatform of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and devotional service; it is then and there\nthat he can attain the highest perfectional stage, not otherwise.\n\n\nThe word k\u0101ma-c\u0101rata\u1e25 is very significant. A person who knowingly violates the\nrules acts in lust. He knows that this is forbidden, still he acts. This is\ncalled acting whimsically. He knows that this should be done, but still he does\nnot do it; therefore he is called whimsical. Such persons are destined to be\ncondemned by the Supreme Lord. Such persons cannot have the perfection which is\nmeant for the human life. The human life is especially meant for purifying one\u2019s\nexistence, and one who does not follow the rules and regulations cannot purify\nhimself, nor can he attain the real stage of happiness.\n\n\n16.24\n\n\ntasm\u0101c ch\u0101stra\u1e41 pram\u0101\u1e47a\u1e41 te\n\n\nk\u0101ry\u0101k\u0101rya-vyavasthitau\n\n\nj\u00f1\u0101tv\u0101 \u015b\u0101stra-vidh\u0101nokta\u1e41\n\n\nkarma kartum ih\u0101rhasi\n\n\ntasm\u0101t\u2014therefore; \u015b\u0101stram\u2014scriptures; pram\u0101\u1e47am\u2014evidence; te\u2014your; k\u0101rya\u2014duty;\nak\u0101rya\u2014forbidden activities; vyavasthitau\u2014in determining; j\u00f1\u0101tv\u0101\u2014knowing;\n\u015b\u0101stra\u2014of scripture; vidh\u0101na\u2014regulations; uktam\u2014as declared; karma\u2014work;\nkartum\u2014to do; iha arhasi\u2014you should do it.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nOne should understand what is duty and what is not duty by the regulations of\nthe scriptures. Knowing such rules and regulations, one should act so that he\nmay gradually be elevated.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nAs stated in the Fifteenth Chapter, all the rules and regulations of the Vedas\nare meant for knowing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. If one understands Krs\u1e47a from the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and\nbecomes situated in Krs\u1e47a consciousness, engaging himself in devotional service,\nhe has reached the highest perfection of knowledge offered by the Vedic\nliterature. Lord Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu made this process very easy: He asked\npeople simply to chant Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare\nR\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare and to engage in the devotional service of\nthe Lord and eat the remnants of foodstuff offered to the Deity. One who is\ndirectly engaged in all these devotional activities is to be understood as\nhaving studied all Vedic literature. He has come to the conclusion perfectly. Of\ncourse, for the ordinary persons who are not in Krs\u1e47a consciousness or who are\nnot engaged in devotional service, what is to be done and what is not to be done\nmust be decided by the injunctions of the Vedas. One should act accordingly,\nwithout argument. That is called following the principles of \u015b\u0101stra, or\nscripture. \u015a\u0101stra is without the four principal defects that are visible in the\nconditioned soul: imperfect senses, the propensity for cheating, certainty of\ncommitting mistakes, and certainty of being illusioned. These four principal\ndefects in conditioned life disqualify one from putting forth rules and\nregulations. Therefore, the rules and regulations as described in the\n\u015b\u0101stra\u2014being above these defects\u2014are accepted without alteration by all great\nsaints, \u0101c\u0101ryas, and great souls.\n\n\nIn India there are many parties of spiritual understanding, generally classified\nas two: the impersonalist and the personalist. Both of them, however, lead their\nlives according to the principles of the Vedas. Without following the principles\nof the scriptures, one cannot elevate himself to the perfectional stage. One who\nactually, therefore, understands the purport of the \u015b\u0101stras is considered\nfortunate.\n\n\nIn human society, aversion to the principles of understanding the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead is the cause of all falldowns. That is the greatest\noffense of human life. Therefore, m\u0101y\u0101, the material energy of the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead, is always giving us trouble in the shape of the\nthreefold miseries. This material energy is constituted of the three modes of\nmaterial nature. One has to raise himself at least to the mode of goodness\nbefore the path to understanding the Supreme Lord can be opened. Without raising\noneself to the standard of the mode of goodness, one remains in ignorance and\npassion, which are the cause of demoniac life. Those in the modes of passion and\nignorance deride the scriptures, deride the holy man, and deride the proper\nunderstanding of the spiritual master, and they do not care for the regulations\nof the scriptures. In spite of hearing the glories of devotional service, they\nare not attracted. Thus they manufacture their own way of elevation. These are\nsome of the defects of human society, which lead to the demoniac status of life.\nIf, however, one is able to be guided by a proper and bona fide spiritual\nmaster, who can lead one to the path of elevation, to the higher stage, then\none\u2019s life becomes successful.",

TRANSLATION  The Blessed Lord said: Fearlessness, purification of one\u2019s existence,\ncultivation of spiritual knowledge, charity, self-control, performance of\nsacrifice, study of the Vedas, austerity and simplicity; nonviolence,\ntruthfulness, freedom from anger; renunciation, tranquility, aversion to\nfaultfinding, compassion and freedom from covetousness; gentleness, modesty and\nsteady determination; vigor, forgiveness, fortitude, cleanliness, freedom from\nenvy and the passion for honor\u2014these transcendental qualities, O son of Bharata,\nbelong to godly men endowed with divine nature.  PURPORT  In the beginning of the Fifteenth Chapter, the banyan tree of this material\nworld was explained. The extra roots coming out of it were compared to the\nactivities of the living entities, some auspicious, some inauspicious. In the\nNinth Chapter, also, the devas, or godly, and the asuras, the ungodly, or\ndemons, were explained. Now, according to Vedic rites, activities in the mode of\ngoodness are considered auspicious for progress on the path of liberation, and\nsuch activities are known as deva prak\u1e5bti, transcendental by nature. Those who\nare situated in the transcendental nature make progress on the path of\nliberation. For those who are acting in the modes of passion and ignorance, on\nthe other hand, there is no possibility of liberation. Either they will have to  remain in this material world as human beings, or they will descend among the\nspecies of animals or even lower life forms. In this Sixteenth Chapter the Lord\nexplains both the transcendental nature and its attendant qualities, as well as\nthe demoniac nature and its qualities. He also explains the advantages and\ndisadvantages of these qualities.  The word abhij\u0101tasya in reference to one born of transcendental qualities or\ngodly tendencies is very significant. To beget a child in a godly atmosphere is\nknown in the Vedic scriptures as Garbh\u0101dh\u0101na-sa\u1e41sk\u0101ra. If the parents want a\nchild in the godly qualities they should follow the ten principles of the human\nbeing. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 we have studied also before that sex life for begetting\na good child is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself. Sex life is not condemned provided the process is\nused in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Those who are in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness at least\nshould not beget children like cats and dogs but should beget them so they may\nbecome K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious after birth. That should be the advantage of children\nborn of a father or mother absorbed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.  The social institution known as var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma\u2014the institution dividing\nsociety into four divisions or castes\u2014is not meant to divide human society\naccording to birth. Such divisions are in terms of educational qualifications.\nThey are to keep the society in a state of peace and prosperity. The qualities\nmentioned herein are explained as transcendental qualities meant for making a\nperson progress in spiritual understanding so he can get liberated from the\nmaterial world. In the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama institution the sanny\u0101s\u012b, or the person in the\nrenounced order of life, is considered to be the head or the spiritual master of\nall the social statuses and orders. A br\u0101hma\u1e47a is considered to be the spiritual\nmaster of the three other sections of a society, namely, the k\u1e63atriyas, the\nvai\u015byas and the \u015b\u016bdras, but a sanny\u0101s\u012b, who is on the top of the institution, is\nconsidered to be the spiritual master of the br\u0101hma\u1e47as also. For a sanny\u0101s\u012b, the\nfirst qualification should be fearlessness. Because a sanny\u0101s\u012b has to be alone\nwithout any support or guarantee of support, he has simply to depend on the\nmercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If he thinks, \u201cAfter leaving my\nconnections, who will protect me?\u201d he should not accept the renounced order of\nlife. One must be fully convinced that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead in His localized aspect as Param\u0101tm\u0101 is always within, that He is seeing\neverything and He always knows what one intends to do. One must thus have firm\nconviction that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as Param\u0101tm\u0101 will take care of a soul surrendered to Him.\n\u201cI shall never be alone,\u201d one should think. \u201cEven if I live in the darkest\nregions of a forest I shall be accompanied by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and He will give me all\nprotection.\u201d That conviction is called abhayam, without fear. This state of mind\nis necessary for a person in the renounced order of life. Then he has to purify\nhis existence. There are so many rules and regulations to be followed in the\nrenounced order of life. Most important of all, a sanny\u0101s\u012b is strictly forbidden\nto have any intimate relationship with a woman. He is even forbidden to talk\nwith a woman in a secluded place. Lord Caitanya was an ideal sanny\u0101s\u012b, and when\nHe was at Pur\u012b His feminine devotees could not even come near to offer their\nrespects. They were advised to bow down from a distant place. This is not a sign\nof hatred for women as a class, but it is a stricture imposed on the sanny\u0101s\u012b\nnot to have close connections with women. One has to follow the rules and\nregulations of a particular status of life in order to purify his existence. For\na sanny\u0101s\u012b, intimate relations with women and possessions of wealth for sense\ngratification are strictly forbidden. The ideal sanny\u0101s\u012b was Lord Caitanya\nHimself, and we can learn from His life that He was very strict in regards to\nwomen. Although He is considered to be the most liberal incarnation of Godhead,\naccepting the most fallen conditioned souls, He strictly followed the rules and\nregulations of the sanny\u0101sa order of the life in connection with association\nwith woman. One of His personal associates, namely Cho\u1e6da Harid\u0101sa, was\npersonally associated with Lord Caitanya, along with His other confidential\npersonal associates, but somehow or other this Cho\u1e6da Harid\u0101sa looked lustily on\na young woman, and Lord Caitanya was so strict that He at once rejected him from\nthe society of His personal associates. Lord Caitanya said, \u201cFor a sanny\u0101s\u012b or\nanyone who is aspiring to get out of the clutches of material nature and trying\nto elevate himself to the spiritual nature and go back to home, back to Godhead,\nfor him, looking toward material possessions and women for sense\ngratification\u2014not even enjoying them, but just looking toward them with such a\npropensity\u2014is so condemned that he had better commit suicide before experiencing\nsuch illicit desires.\u201d So these are the processes for purification.  The next item is j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga-vyavasthiti\u1e25: being engaged in the cultivation of\nknowledge. Sanny\u0101s\u012b life is meant for distributing knowledge to the householders\nand others who have forgotten their real life of spiritual advancement. A\nsanny\u0101s\u012b is supposed to beg from door to door for his livelihood, but this does\nnot mean that he is a beggar. Humility is also one of the qualifications of a\ntranscendentally situated person, and out of sheer humility the sanny\u0101s\u012b goes\nfrom door to door, not exactly for the purpose of begging, but to see the\nhouseholders and awaken them to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. This is the duty of a\nsanny\u0101s\u012b. If he is actually advanced and so ordered by his spiritual master, he\nshould preach K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a with logic and understanding, and if he is not so advanced\nhe should not accept the renounced order of life. But even if he has accepted\nthe renounced order of life without sufficient knowledge, he should engage\nhimself fully in hearing from a bona fide spiritual master to cultivate\nknowledge. A sanny\u0101s\u012b or one in the renounced order of life must be situated in\nfearlessness, sattva-sa\u1e41\u015buddhi\u1e25 (purity) and j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga (knowledge).  The next item is charity. Charity is meant for the householders. The\nhouseholders should earn a livelihood by an honorable means and spend fifty\npercent of their income to propagate K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness all over the world.\nThus a householder should give in charity to such institutional societies that\nare engaged in that way. Charity should be given to the right receiver. There\nare different kinds of charities, as will be explained later on, charity in the\nmodes of goodness, passion and ignorance. Charity in the mode of goodness is\nrecommended by the scriptures, but charity in the modes of passion and ignorance\nis not recommended because it is simply a waste of money. Charity should be\ngiven only to propagate K\u1e5bsna consciousness all over the world. That is charity\nin the mode of goodness.  Then as far as dama\u1e25 (self-control) is concerned, it is not only meant for other\norders of religious society, but it is especially meant for the householder.\nAlthough he has a wife, a householder should not use his senses for sex life\nunnecessarily. There are restrictions for the householders even in sex life,\nwhich should only be engaged in for the propagation of children. If he does not\nrequire children, he should not enjoy sex life with his wife. Modern society\nenjoys sex life with contraceptive methods or more abominable methods to avoid\nthe responsibility of children. This is not in the transcendental quality but is\ndemoniac. If anyone, even if he is a householder, wants to make progress in\nspiritual life, he must control his sex life and should not beget a child\nwithout the purpose of serving K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. If he is able to beget children who will\nbe in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, one can produce hundreds of children, but without\nthis capacity one should not indulge only for sense pleasure.  Sacrifice is another item to be performed by the householders because sacrifices\nrequire a large amount of money. Other orders of life, namely the brahmacarya,\nthe v\u0101naprastha and sanny\u0101sa, have no money; they live by begging. So\nperformance of different types of sacrifice is meant for the householder. They\nshould perform agni-hotra sacrifices as enjoined in the Vedic literature, but\nsuch sacrifices at the present moment are very expensive, and it is not possible\nfor any householder to perform them. The best sacrifice recommended in this age\nis called sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-yaj\u00f1a, the chanting of Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a,\nHare Hare/Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare. This is the best and most\ninexpensive sacrifice; everyone can adopt it and derive benefit. So these three\nitems, namely charity, sense control and performance of sacrifice, are meant for\nthe householder.  Then sv\u0101dhy\u0101ya\u1e25, Vedic study, and tapas, austerity, and \u0101rjavam, gentleness or\nsimplicity, are meant for the brahmacarya or student life. Brahmac\u0101r\u012bs should\nhave no connection with women; they should live a life of celibacy and engage\nthe mind in the study of Vedic literature for cultivation of spiritual\nknowledge. This is called sv\u0101dhy\u0101ya\u1e25. Tapas or austerity is especially meant for\nthe retired life. One should not remain a householder throughout his whole life;\nhe must always remember that there are four divisions of life, brahmacarya,\ng\u1e5bhastha, v\u0101naprastha and sanny\u0101sa. So after g\u1e5bhastha, householder life, one\nshould retire. If one lives for a hundred years, he should spend twenty-five\nyears in student life, twenty-five in householder life, twenty-five in retired\nlife and twenty-five in the renounced order of life. These are the regulations\nof the Vedic religious discipline. A man retired from household life must\npractice austerities of the body, mind and tongue. That is tapasy\u0101. The entire\nvar\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma society is meant for tapasy\u0101. Without tapasy\u0101 or austerity no\nhuman being can get liberation. The theory that there is no need of austerity in\nlife, that one can go on speculating and everything will be nice, is neither\nrecommended in the Vedic literature nor in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Such theories are\nmanufactured by showbottle spiritualists who are trying to gather more\nfollowers. If there are restrictions, rules and regulations, people will not\nbecome attracted. Therefore those who want followers in the name of religion,\njust to have a show only, don\u2019t restrict the lives of their students nor their\nown lives. But that method is not approved by the Vedas.  As far as simplicity is concerned, not only should a particular order of life\nfollow this principle, but every member, be he in the brahmacarya-\u0101\u015brama, or\ng\u1e5bhastha-\u0101\u015brama or v\u0101naprastha-\u0101\u015brama. One must live very simply.  Ahi\u1e41s\u0101 means not arresting the progressive life of any living entity. One should\nnot think that since the spirit spark is never killed even after the killing of\nthe body there is no harm in killing animals for sense gratification. People are\nnow addicted to eating animals, in spite of having an ample supply of grains,\nfruits and milk. There is no necessity for animal killing. This injunction is\nfor everyone. When there is no other alternative, one may kill an animal, but it\nshould be offered in sacrifice. At any rate, when there is an ample food supply\nfor humanity, persons who are desiring to make advancement in spiritual\nrealization should not commit violence to animals. Real ahi\u1e41s\u0101 means not\nchecking anyone\u2019s progressive life. The animals are also making progress in\ntheir evolutionary life by transmigrating from one category of animal life to\nanother. If a particular animal is killed, then his progress is checked. If an\nanimal is staying in a particular body for so many days or so many years and is\nuntimely killed, then he has to come back again in that form of life to complete\nthe remaining days in order to be promoted to another species of life. So their\nprogress should not be checked simply to satisfy one\u2019s palate. This is called\nahi\u1e41s\u0101.  Satyam. This word means that one should not distort the truth for some personal\ninterest. In Vedic literature there are some difficult passages, but the meaning\nor the purpose should be learned from a bona fide spiritual master. That is the\nprocess for understanding Vedas. \u015aruti means that one should hear from the\nauthority. One should not construe some interpretation for his personal\ninterest. There are so many commentaries on Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that misinterpret the\noriginal text. The real import of the word should be presented, and that should\nbe learned from a bona fide spiritual master.  Akrodha\u1e25 means to check anger. Even if there is provocation one should be\ntolerant, for once one becomes angry his whole body becomes polluted. Anger is\nthe product of the modes of passion and lust, so one who is transcendentally\nsituated should check himself from anger. Apai\u015bunam means that one should not\nfind fault with others or correct them unnecessarily. Of course to call a thief\na thief is not faultfinding, but to call an honest person a thief is very much\noffensive for one who is making advancement in spiritual life. Hr\u012b\u1e25 means that\none should be very modest and must not perform some act which is abominable.\nAc\u0101palam, determination, means that one should not be agitated or frustrated in\nsome attempt. There may be failure in some attempt, but one should not be sorry\nfor that; he should make progress with patience and determination. The word\nteja\u1e25 used here is meant for the k\u1e63atriyas. The k\u1e63atriyas should always be very\nstrong to be able to give protection to the weak. They should not pose\nthemselves as nonviolent. If violence is required, they must exhibit it.  \u015aaucam means cleanliness, not only in mind and body but in one\u2019s dealings also.\nIt is especially meant for the mercantile people, who should not deal in the\nblack market. N\u0101tim\u0101nit\u0101, not expecting honor, applies to the \u015b\u016bdras, the worker\nclass, which are considered, according to Vedic injunctions, to be the lowest of\nthe four classes. They should not be puffed up with unnecessary prestige or\nhonor and should remain in their own status. It is the duty of the \u015b\u016bdras to\noffer respect to the higher class for the upkeep of the social order.  All these sixteen qualifications mentioned are transcendental qualities. They\nshould be cultivated according to the different statuses of the social order.\nThe purport is that even though material conditions are miserable, if these\nqualities are developed by practice, by all classes of men, then gradually it is\npossible to rise to the highest platform of transcendental realization.",

His involvement in the fight was not demoniac because he was\nconsidering the pro\u2019s and con\u2019s. He was considering whether respectable persons\nsuch as Bh\u012b\u1e63ma and Dro\u1e47a should be killed or not, so he was not acting under the\ninfluence of anger, false prestige, or harshness. Therefore he was not of the\nquality of the demons. For a k\u1e63atriya, a military man, shooting arrows at the\nenemy is considered transcendental, and refraining from such a duty is demoniac.\nTherefore, there was no cause for Arjuna to lament. Anyone who performs the\nregulated principles of the different orders of life is transcendentally\nsituated.",

PURPORT  Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, having assured Arjuna that he was born with the divine qualities, is\nnow describing the demoniac way. The conditioned living entities are divided\ninto two classes in this world. Those who are born with divine qualities follow\na regulated life; that is to say they abide by the injunctions in scriptures and\nby the authorities. One should perform duties in the light of authoritative\nscripture. This mentality is called divine. One who does not follow the\nregulative principles as they are laid down in the scriptures and who acts\naccording to his whims is called demoniac or asuric. There is no other criterion\nbut obedience to the regulative principles of scriptures. It is mentioned in\nVedic literature that both the demigods and the demons are born of the\nPraj\u0101pati; the only difference is that one class obeys the Vedic injunctions and\nthe other does not.",

TRANSLATION  Those who are demoniac do not know what is to be done and what is not to be\ndone. Neither cleanliness nor proper behavior nor truth is found in them.  PURPORT  In every civilized human society there is some set of scriptural rules and\nregulations which are followed from the beginning, especially among the \u0100ryans,\nthose who adopt the Vedic civilization and who are known as the most advanced\ncivilized peoples. Those who do not follow the scriptural injunctions are\nsupposed to be demons. Therefore it is stated here that the demons do not know\nthe scriptural rules, nor do they have any inclination to follow them. Most of\nthem do not know them, and even if some of them know, they have not the tendency\nto follow them. They have no faith, nor are they willing to act in terms of the\nVedic injunctions. The demons are not clean, either externally or internally.  One should always be careful to keep his body clean by bathing, brushing teeth,\nchanging clothes, etc. As far as internal cleanliness is concerned, one should\nalways remember the holy names of God and chant Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare. The demons neither\nlike nor follow all these rules for external and internal cleanliness.  As for behavior, there are many rules and regulations guiding human behavior,\nsuch as the Manu-sa\u1e41hit\u0101, which is the law of the human race. Even up to today,\nthose who are Hindu follow the Manu-sa\u1e41hit\u0101. Laws of inheritance and other\nlegalities are derived from this book. Now, in the Manu-sa\u1e41hit\u0101, it is clearly\nstated that a woman should not be given freedom. That does not mean that women\nare to be kept as slaves, but they are like children. Children are not given\nfreedom, but that does not mean that they are kept as slaves. The demons have\nnow neglected such injunctions, and they think that women should be given as\nmuch freedom as men. However, this has not improved the social condition of the\nworld. Actually, a woman should be given protection at every stage of life. She\nshould be given protection by the father in her younger days, by the husband in\nher youth, and by the grownup sons in her old age. This is proper social\nbehavior according to the Manu-sa\u1e41hit\u0101. But modern education has artificially\ndevised a puffed up concept of womanly life, and therefore marriage is\npractically now an imagination in human society. Nor is the moral condition of\nwoman very good now. The demons, therefore, do not accept any instruction which\nis good for society, and because they do not follow the experience of great\nsages and the rules and regulations laid down by the sages, the social condition\nof the demoniac people is very miserable.",

TRANSLATION  They say that this world is unreal, that there is no foundation and that there\nis no God in control. It is produced of sex desire, and has no cause other than\nlust.  PURPORT  The demoniac conclude that the world is phantasmagoria. There is no cause, no\neffect, no controller, no purpose: everything is unreal. They say that this\ncosmic manifestation arises due to chance material actions and reactions. They\ndo not think that the world was created by God for a certain purpose. They have\ntheir own theory: that the world has come about in its own way and that there is\nno reason to believe that there is a God behind it. For them there is no\ndifference between spirit and matter, and they do not accept the Supreme Spirit.\nEverything is matter only, and the whole cosmos is supposed to be a mass of\nignorance. According to them, everything is void, and whatever manifestation\nexists is due to our ignorance in perception. They take it for granted that all\nmanifestation of diversity is a display of ignorance. Just as in a dream we may\ncreate so many things, which actually have no existence, so when we are awake we\nshall see that everything is simply a dream. But factually, although the demons\nsay that life is a dream, they are very expert in enjoying this dream. And so,\ninstead of acquiring knowledge, they become more and more implicated in their\ndreamland. They conclude that as a child is simply the result of sexual\nintercourse between man and woman, this world is born without any soul. For them\nit is only a combination of matter that has produced the living entities, and\nthere is no question of the existence of the soul. As many living creatures come\nout from perspiration and from a dead body without any cause, similarly, the\nwhole living world has come out of the material combinations of the cosmic\nmanifestation. Therefore material nature is the cause of this manifestation, and\nthere is no other cause. They do not believe in the words of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101: may\u0101dhyak\u1e63e\u1e47a prak\u1e5bti\u1e25 s\u016byate sa-car\u0101caram. \u201cUnder My direction\nthe whole material world is moving.\u201d In other words, amongst the demons there is\nno perfect knowledge of the creation of this world; every one of them has some\nparticular theory of his own.

Such materialistic inventions are considered\nto be advancement of human civilization, but the result is that people grow more\nand more violent and more and more cruel, cruel to animals and cruel to other\nhuman beings. They have no idea how to behave toward one another. Animal killing\nis very prominent amongst demoniac people. Such people are considered the\nenemies of the world because ultimately they will invent or create something\nwhich will bring destruction to all.

Although they are always full of anxieties on account of accepting\nnonpermanent things, they still continue to engage in such activities out of\nillusion.

Their plans for life are\nnever finished, and they go on preparing plan after plan, all of which are never\nfinished. We have personal experience of a person of such demoniac mentality,\nwho, even at the point of death, was requesting the physician to prolong his\nlife for four years more because his plans were not yet complete. Such foolish\npeople do not know that a physician cannot prolong life even for a moment. When\nthe notice is there, there is no consideration of the man\u2019s desire. The laws of\nnature do not allow a second beyond what one is destined to enjoy.  The demoniac person, who has no faith in God or the Supersoul within himself,\nperforms all kinds of sinful activities simply for sense gratification. He does\nnot know that there is a witness sitting within his heart. The Supersoul is\nobserving the activities of the individual soul. As it is stated in the Vedic\nliterature, the Upani\u1e63ads, there are two birds sitting in one tree; the one is\nacting and enjoying or suffering the fruits of the branches, and the other is\nwitnessing. But one who is demoniac has no knowledge of Vedic scripture, nor has\nhe any faith; therefore he feels free to do anything for sense enjoyment,\nregardless of the consequences.",

TRANSLATION  Thus perplexed by various anxieties and bound by a network of illusions, one\nbecomes too strongly attached to sense enjoyment and falls down into hell.  PURPORT  The demoniac man knows no limit to his desire to acquire money. That is\nunlimited. He only thinks how much assessment he has just now and schemes to\nengage that stock of wealth farther and farther. For that reason, he does not\nhesitate to act in any sinful way and so deals in the black market for illegal\ngratification. He is enamoured by the possessions he has already, such as land,\nfamily, house and bank balance, and he is always planning to improve them. He\nbelieves in his own strength, and he does not know that whatever he is gaining\nis due to his past good deeds. He is given an opportunity to accumulate such\nthings, but he has no conception of past causes. He simply thinks that all his\nmass of wealth is due to his own endeavor. A demoniac person believes in the\nstrength of his personal work, not in the law of karma. According to the law of\nkarma, a man takes his birth in a high family, or becomes rich, or very well\neducated, or very beautiful because of good work in the past. The demoniac\nthinks that all these things are accidental and due to the strength of his\npersonal ability. He does not sense any arrangement behind all the varieties of\npeople, beauty, and education. Anyone who comes into competition with such a\ndemoniac man is his enemy. There are many demoniac people, and each is enemy to\nthe others. This enmity becomes more and more deep\u2014between persons, then between\nfamilies, then between societies, and at last between nations. Therefore there\nis constant strife, war and enmity all over the world.  Each demoniac person thinks that he can live at the sacrifice of all others.\nGenerally, a demoniac person thinks of himself as the Supreme God, and a\ndemoniac preacher tells his followers: \u201cWhy are you seeking God elsewhere? You\nare all yourselves God! Whatever you like, you can do. Don\u2019t believe in God.\nThrow away God. God is dead.\u201d These are the demoniac\u2019s preachings.  Although the demoniac person sees others equally rich and influential, or even\nmore so, he thinks that no one is richer than him and that no one is more\ninfluential than him. As far as promotion to the higher planetary system is\nconcerned, he does not believe in performing yaj\u00f1as or sacrifices. Demons think\nthat they will manufacture their own process of yaj\u00f1a and prepare some machine,\nby which they will be able to reach any higher planet. The best example of such\na demoniac man was R\u0101va\u1e47a. He offered a program to the people by which he would\nprepare a staircase so that anyone could reach the heavenly planets without\nperforming sacrifices, such as are prescribed in the Vedas. Similarly, in the\npresent age such demoniac men are striving to reach the higher planetary systems\nby mechanical arrangement. These are examples of bewilderment. The result is\nthat, without their knowledge, they are gliding toward hell. Here the Sanskrit\nword mohaj\u0101la is very significant. J\u0101la means net; like fishes caught in a net,\nthey have no way to come out.",

Sometimes such\ndemons take up the role of preacher, mislead the people, and become known as\nreligious reformers or as incarnations of God.

They take the dress of the renounced order of life and\nengage in all nonsense in that dress. Actually there are so many restrictions\nfor one who has renounced this world. The demons, however, do not care for such\nrestrictions. They think that whatever path one can create is one\u2019s own path;\nthere is no such thing as a standard path one has to follow.

Therefore in the material\nexistence we find so many species of life\u2014animals, insects, men, and so on. All\nare arranged by the superior power. They are not accidental. As for the\ndemoniac, it is clearly said here that they are perpetually put into the wombs\nof demons, and thus they continue to be envious, the lowest of mankind.

TRANSLATION  Attaining repeated birth amongst the species of demoniac life, such persons can\nnever approach Me. Gradually they sink down to the most abominable type of\nexistence.  PURPORT  It is known that God is all-merciful, but here we find that God is never\nmerciful to the demoniac. It is clearly stated that the demoniac people, life\nafter life, are put into the wombs of similar demons, and, not achieving the\nmercy of the Supreme Lord, they go down and down, so that at last they achieve\nbodies like those of cats, dogs and hogs. It is clearly stated that such demons\nhave practically no chance of receiving the mercy of God at any stage of later\nlife. In the Vedas also it is stated that such persons gradually sink to become\ndogs and hogs. It may be then argued in this connection that God should not be\nadvertised as all-merciful if He is not merciful to such demons. In answer to\nthis question, in the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra we find that the Supreme Lord has no hatred\nfor anyone. The placing of the asuras, the demons, in the lowest status of life\nis simply another feature of His mercy. Sometimes the asuras are killed by the\nSupreme Lord, but this killing is also good for them, for in Vedic literature we\nfind that anyone who is killed by the Supreme Lord becomes liberated. There are\ninstances in history of many asuras\u2014R\u0101va\u1e47a, Ka\u1e41sa, Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu\u2014to whom the\nLord appeared in various incarnations just to kill.

In\nthat devotional service, the liberation of the conditioned soul is guaranteed.\nTherefore, according to the Vedic system, there are instituted the four orders\nof life and the four statuses of life, called the caste system and the spiritual\norder system.

In other words, a man may theoretically know all these\nthings, but if he does not apply them in his own life, then he is to be known as\nthe lowest of mankind. In the human form of life, a living entity is expected to\nbe sane and to follow the regulations given for elevating his life to the\nhighest platform, but if he does not follow them, then he degrades himself.

He knows that this should be done, but still he does\nnot do it; therefore he is called whimsical. Such persons are destined to be\ncondemned by the Supreme Lord. Such persons cannot have the perfection which is\nmeant for the human life. The human life is especially meant for purifying one\u2019s\nexistence, and one who does not follow the rules and regulations cannot purify\nhimself, nor can he attain the real stage of happiness.",

TRANSLATION  One should understand what is duty and what is not duty by the regulations of\nthe scriptures. Knowing such rules and regulations, one should act so that he\nmay gradually be elevated.  PURPORT  As stated in the Fifteenth Chapter, all the rules and regulations of the Vedas\nare meant for knowing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. If one understands Krs\u1e47a from the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and\nbecomes situated in Krs\u1e47a consciousness, engaging himself in devotional service,\nhe has reached the highest perfection of knowledge offered by the Vedic\nliterature. Lord Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu made this process very easy: He asked\npeople simply to chant Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare\nR\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare and to engage in the devotional service of\nthe Lord and eat the remnants of foodstuff offered to the Deity. One who is\ndirectly engaged in all these devotional activities is to be understood as\nhaving studied all Vedic literature. He has come to the conclusion perfectly. Of\ncourse, for the ordinary persons who are not in Krs\u1e47a consciousness or who are\nnot engaged in devotional service, what is to be done and what is not to be done\nmust be decided by the injunctions of the Vedas. One should act accordingly,\nwithout argument. That is called following the principles of \u015b\u0101stra, or\nscripture. \u015a\u0101stra is without the four principal defects that are visible in the\nconditioned soul: imperfect senses, the propensity for cheating, certainty of\ncommitting mistakes, and certainty of being illusioned. These four principal\ndefects in conditioned life disqualify one from putting forth rules and\nregulations. Therefore, the rules and regulations as described in the\n\u015b\u0101stra\u2014being above these defects\u2014are accepted without alteration by all great\nsaints, \u0101c\u0101ryas, and great souls.  In India there are many parties of spiritual understanding, generally classified\nas two: the impersonalist and the personalist. Both of them, however, lead their\nlives according to the principles of the Vedas. Without following the principles\nof the scriptures, one cannot elevate himself to the perfectional stage. One who\nactually, therefore, understands the purport of the \u015b\u0101stras is considered\nfortunate.  In human society, aversion to the principles of understanding the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead is the cause of all falldowns. That is the greatest\noffense of human life. Therefore, m\u0101y\u0101, the material energy of the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead, is always giving us trouble in the shape of the\nthreefold miseries. This material energy is constituted of the three modes of\nmaterial nature. One has to raise himself at least to the mode of goodness\nbefore the path to understanding the Supreme Lord can be opened. Without raising\noneself to the standard of the mode of goodness, one remains in ignorance and\npassion, which are the cause of demoniac life. Those in the modes of passion and\nignorance deride the scriptures, deride the holy man, and deride the proper\nunderstanding of the spiritual master, and they do not care for the regulations\nof the scriptures. In spite of hearing the glories of devotional service, they\nare not attracted. Thus they manufacture their own way of elevation. These are\nsome of the defects of human society, which lead to the demoniac status of life.\nIf, however, one is able to be guided by a proper and bona fide spiritual\nmaster, who can lead one to the path of elevation, to the higher stage, then\none\u2019s life becomes successful.",

In\nthe Sixteenth Chapter, it is concluded that one who does not follow the\nprinciples laid down in the scriptures is called an asura, demon, and one who\nfollows the scriptural injunctions faithfully is called a deva, or demigod. Now,\nif one, with faith, follows some rules which are not mentioned in the scriptural\ninjunctions, what is his position? This doubt of Arjuna is to be cleared by\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.

Now hear\nabout these.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThose who know the rules and regulations of the scriptures, but, out of laziness\nor indolence, give up following these rules and regulations, are governed by the\nmodes of material nature. According to their previous activities in the modes of\ngoodness, passion or ignorance, they acquire a nature which is of a specific\nquality. The association of the living entity with the different modes of nature\nhas been going on perpetually since the living entity is in contact with\nmaterial nature. Thus he acquires different types of mentality according to his\nassociation with the material modes. But this nature can be changed if one\nassociates with a bona fide spiritual master and abides by his rules and the\nscriptures. Gradually, one can change his position from ignorance to goodness,\nor from passion to goodness. The conclusion is that blind faith in a particular\nmode of nature cannot help a person become elevated to the perfectional stage.\nOne has to consider things carefully, with intelligence, in the association of a\nbona fide spiritual master. Thus one can change his position to a higher mode of\nnature.\n\n\n17.3\n\n\nsattv\u0101nur\u016bp\u0101 sarvasya\n\n\n\u015braddh\u0101 bhavati bh\u0101rata\n\n\n\u015braddh\u0101-mayo \u2019ya\u1e41 puru\u1e63o\n\n\nyo yac-chraddha\u1e25 sa eva sa\u1e25\n\n\nsattva-anur\u016bp\u0101\u2014according to the existence; sarvasya\u2014of everyone; \u015braddh\u0101\u2014faith;\nbhavati\u2014becomes; bh\u0101rata\u2014O son of Bh\u0101rata; \u015braddh\u0101\u2014faith; maya\u1e25\u2014full; ayam\u2014this;\npuru\u1e63a\u1e25\u2014living entity; ya\u1e25\u2014anyone; yat\u2014that; \u015braddha\u1e25\u2014faith; sa\u1e25\u2014that;\neva\u2014certainly; sa\u1e25\u2014he.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nAccording to one\u2019s existence under the various modes of nature, one evolves a\nparticular kind of faith. The living being is said to be of a particular faith\naccording to the modes he has acquired.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nEveryone has a particular type of faith, regardless of what he is. But his faith\nis considered good, passionate or ignorant according to the nature he has\nacquired. Thus, according to his particular type of faith, one associates with\ncertain persons. Now the real fact is that every living being, as is stated in\nthe Fifteenth Chapter, is originally the fragmental part and parcel of the\nSupreme Lord. Therefore one is originally transcendental to all the modes of\nmaterial nature. But when one forgets his relationship with the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead and comes into contact with the material nature in\nconditional life, he generates his own position by association with the\ndifferent varieties of material nature. The resultant artificial faith and\nexistence are only material. Although one may be conducted by some impression,\nor some conception of life, still, originally, he is nirgu\u1e47a, or transcendental.\nTherefore one has to become cleansed of the material contamination that he has\nacquired in order to regain his relationship with the Supreme Lord. That is the\nonly path back without fear: K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. If one is situated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness, then that path is guaranteed for his elevation to the\nperfectional stage. If one does not take to this path of self-realization, then\nhe is surely to be conducted by the influence of the modes of nature.\n\n\nThe word sattva, or faith, is very significant in this verse. Sattva or faith\nalways comes out of the works of goodness. One\u2019s faith may be in a demigod or\nsome created God or some mental concoction. It is supposed to be one\u2019s strong\nfaith in something that is productive of the works of material goodness. But in\nmaterial conditional life, no works of material nature are completely purified.\nThey are mixed. They are not in pure goodness. Pure goodness is transcendental;\nin purified goodness one can understand the real nature of the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead. As long as one\u2019s faith is not completely in purified\ngoodness, the faith is subject to contamination by any of the modes of material\nnature. The contaminated modes of material nature expand to the heart. Therefore\naccording to the position of the heart in contact with a particular mode of\nmaterial nature, one\u2019s faith is established. It should be understood, that if\none\u2019s heart is in the mode of goodness, his faith is also in the mode of\ngoodness. If his heart is in the mode of passion, his faith is also in the mode\nof passion. And if his heart is in the mode of darkness, illusion, his faith is\nalso thus contaminated. Thus we find different types of faith in this world, and\nthere are different types of religions due to different types of faith. The real\nprinciple of religious faith is situated in the mode of pure goodness, but\nbecause the heart is tainted, we find different types of religious principles.\nThus according to different types of faith, there are different kinds of\nworship.\n\n\n17.4\n\n\nyajante s\u0101ttvik\u0101 dev\u0101n\n\n\nyak\u1e63a-rak\u1e63\u0101\u1e41si r\u0101jas\u0101\u1e25\n\n\npret\u0101n bh\u016bta-ga\u1e47\u0101\u1e41\u015b c\u0101nye\n\n\nyajante t\u0101mas\u0101 jan\u0101\u1e25\n\n\nyajante\u2014worship; s\u0101ttvik\u0101\u1e25\u2014those who are in the mode of goodness;\ndev\u0101n\u2014demigods; yak\u1e63a-rak\u1e63\u0101\u1e41si r\u0101jas\u0101\u1e25\u2014those who are in the mode of passion\nworship demons; pret\u0101n\u2014dead spirits; bh\u016bta-ga\u1e47\u0101n\u2014ghosts; ca anye\u2014and others;\nyajante\u2014worship; t\u0101mas\u0101\u1e25\u2014in the mode of ignorance; jan\u0101\u1e25\u2014people.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nMen in the mode of goodness worship the demigods; those in the mode of passion\nworship the demons; and those in the mode of ignorance worship ghosts and\nspirits.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nIn this verse the Supreme Personality of Godhead describes different kinds of\nworshipers according to their external activities. According to scriptural\ninjunction, only the Supreme Personality of Godhead is worshipable, but those\nwho are not very conversant with, or faithful to, the scriptural injunctions\nworship different objects, according to their specific situations in the modes\nof material nature. Those who are situated in goodness generally worship the\ndemigods. The demigods include Brahm\u0101, \u015aiva and others such as Indra, Candra and\nthe sun-god. There are various demigods. Those in goodness worship a particular\ndemigod for a particular purpose. Similarly, those who are in the mode of\npassion worship the demons. We recall that during the Second World War, a man in\nCalcutta worshiped Hitler because thanks to that war he had amassed a large\namount of wealth by dealing in the black market. Similarly, those in the modes\nof passion and ignorance generally select a powerful man to be God. They think\nthat anyone can be worshiped as God and that the same results will be obtained.\n\n\nNow, it is clearly described here that those who are in the mode of passion\nworship and create such gods, and those who are in the mode of ignorance, in\ndarkness, worship dead spirits. Sometimes people worship at the tomb of some\ndead man. Sexual service is also considered to be in the mode of darkness.\nSimilarly, in remote villages in India there are worshipers of ghosts. We have\nseen that in India the lower class people sometimes go to the forest, and if\nthey have knowledge that a ghost lives in a tree, they worship that tree and\noffer sacrifices. These different kinds of worship are not actually God worship.\nGod worship is for persons who are transcendentally situated in pure goodness.\nIn the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam it is said, sattva\u1e41 vi\u015buddham v\u0101sudeva-\u015babditam. \u201cWhen\na man is situated in pure goodness, he worships V\u0101sudeva.\u201d The purport is that\nthose who are completely purified of the material modes of nature and who are\ntranscendentally situated can worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\n\n\nThe impersonalists are supposed to be situated in the mode of goodness, and they\nworship five kinds of demigods. They worship the impersonal Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, or Vi\u1e63\u1e47u form\nin the material world, which is known as philosophized Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is the\nexpansion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but the impersonalists, because\nthey do not ultimately believe in the Supreme Personality of Godhead, imagine\nthat the Vi\u1e63\u1e47u form is just another aspect of the impersonal Brahman; similarly,\nthey imagine that Lord Brahm\u0101 is the impersonal form in the material mode of\npassion. Thus they sometimes describe five kinds of gods that are worshipable,\nbut because they think that the actual truth is impersonal Brahman, they dispose\nof all worshipable objects at the ultimate end. In conclusion, the different\nqualities of the material modes of nature can be purified through association\nwith persons who are of transcendental nature.\n\n\n17.5-6\n\n\na\u015b\u0101stra-vihita\u1e41 ghora\u1e41\n\n\ntapyante ye tapo jan\u0101\u1e25\n\n\ndambh\u0101ha\u1e45k\u0101ra-sa\u1e41yukt\u0101\u1e25\n\n\nk\u0101ma-r\u0101ga-bal\u0101nvit\u0101\u1e25\n\n\nkar\u1e63ayanta\u1e25 \u015bar\u012bra-stha\u1e41\n\n\nbh\u016bta-gr\u0101mam acetasa\u1e25\n\n\nm\u0101\u1e41 caiv\u0101nta\u1e25 \u015bar\u012bra-stha\u1e41\n\n\nt\u0101n viddhy \u0101sura-ni\u015bcay\u0101n\n\n\na\u015b\u0101stra\u2014not mentioned in the scriptures; vihitam\u2014directed; ghoram\u2014harmful to\nothers; tapyante\u2014undergo penances; ye\u2014those; tapa\u1e25\u2014austerities; jan\u0101\u1e25\u2014persons;\ndambha\u2014pride; aha\u1e45k\u0101ra\u2014egotism; sa\u1e41yukt\u0101\u1e25\u2014engaged; k\u0101ma\u2014lust; r\u0101ga\u2014attachment;\nbala\u2014force; anvit\u0101\u1e25\u2014impelled by; kar\u1e63ayanta\u1e25\u2014tormenting; \u015bar\u012bra-stham\u2014situated\nwithin the body; bh\u016btagr\u0101mam\u2014combination of material elements; acetasa\u1e25\u2014by such\na misled mentality; m\u0101m\u2014to Me; ca\u2014also; eva\u2014certainly; anta\u1e25\u2014within;\n\u015bar\u012bra-stham\u2014situated in the body; t\u0101n\u2014them; viddhi\u2014understand; \u0101sura\u2014demons;\nni\u015bcay\u0101n\u2014certainly.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThose who undergo severe austerities and penances not recommended in the\nscriptures, performing them out of pride, egotism, lust and attachment, who are\nimpelled by passion and who torture their bodily organs as well as the Supersoul\ndwelling within are to be known as demons.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThere are persons who manufacture modes of austerity and penances which are not\nmentioned in the scriptural injunctions. For instance, fasting for some ulterior\npurpose, such as to promote a purely political end, is not mentioned in the\nscriptural directions. The scriptures recommend fasting for spiritual\nadvancement, not for some political end or social purpose. Persons who take to\nsuch austerities are, according to Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, certainly demoniac. Their acts\nare against the scriptural injunction and are not beneficial for the people in\ngeneral. Actually, they act out of pride, false ego, lust and attachment for\nmaterial enjoyment. By such activities, not only are the combination of material\nelements of which the body is constructed disturbed, but also the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead Himself living within the body. Such unauthorized fasting\nor austerities for some political end are certainly very disturbing to others.\nThey are not mentioned in the Vedic literature. A demoniac person may think that\nhe can force his enemy or other parties to comply with his desire by this\nmethod, but sometimes one dies by such fasting. These acts are not approved by\nthe Supreme Personality of Godhead, and He says that those who engage in them\nare demons. Such demonstrations are insults to the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead because they are enacted in disobedience to the Vedic scriptural\ninjunctions. The word acetasa\u1e25 is significant in this connection\u2014persons of\nnormal mental condition must obey the scriptural injunctions. Those who are not\nin such a position neglect and disobey the scriptures and manufacture their own\nway of austerities and penances. One should always remember the ultimate end of\nthe demoniac people, as described in the previous chapter. The Lord forces them\nto take birth in the womb of demoniac persons. Consequently they will live by\ndemoniac principles life after life without knowing their relationship with the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead. If, however, such persons are fortunate enough\nto be guided by a spiritual master who can direct them to the path of Vedic\nwisdom, they can get out of this entanglement and ultimately achieve the supreme\ngoal.\n\n\n17.7\n\n\n\u0101h\u0101ras tv api sarvasya\n\n\ntri-vidho bhavati priya\u1e25\n\n\nyaj\u00f1as tapas tath\u0101 d\u0101na\u1e41\n\n\nte\u1e63\u0101\u1e41 bhedam ima\u1e41 \u015b\u1e5b\u1e47u\n\n\n\u0101h\u0101ra\u1e25\u2014eating; tu\u2014certainly; api\u2014also; sarvasya\u2014of everyone; trividha\u1e25\u2014three\nkinds; bhavati\u2014there are; priya\u1e25\u2014dear; yaj\u00f1a\u1e25\u2014sacrifice; tapa\u1e25\u2014austerity;\ntath\u0101\u2014also; d\u0101nam\u2014charity; te\u1e63\u0101m\u2014of them; bhedam\u2014differences; imam\u2014thus;\n\u015b\u1e5b\u1e47u\u2014hear.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nEven food of which all partake is of three kinds, according to the three modes\nof material nature.

Those who can\nunderstand analytically what kind of performances are in what modes of material\nnature are actually wise; those who consider all kinds of sacrifice or foods or\ncharity to be the same cannot discriminate, and they are foolish. There are\nmissionary workers who advocate that one can do whatever he likes and attain\nperfection. But these foolish guides are not acting according to the direction\nof the scripture. They are manufacturing ways and misleading the people in\ngeneral.\n\n\n17.8-10\n\n\n\u0101yu\u1e25-sattva-bal\u0101rogya-\n\n\nsukha-pr\u012bti-vivardhan\u0101\u1e25\n\n\nrasy\u0101\u1e25 snigdh\u0101\u1e25 sthir\u0101 h\u1e5bdy\u0101\n\n\n\u0101h\u0101r\u0101\u1e25 s\u0101ttvika-priy\u0101\u1e25\n\n\nka\u1e6dv-amla-lava\u1e47\u0101ty-u\u1e63\u1e47a-\n\n\nt\u012bk\u1e63\u1e47a-r\u016bk\u1e63a-vid\u0101hina\u1e25\n\n\n\u0101h\u0101r\u0101 r\u0101jasasye\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\n\n\ndu\u1e25kha-\u015bok\u0101maya-prad\u0101\u1e25\n\n\ny\u0101ta-y\u0101ma\u1e41 gata-rasa\u1e41\n\n\np\u016bti paryu\u1e63ita\u1e41 ca yat\n\n\nucchi\u1e63\u1e6dam api c\u0101medhya\u1e41\n\n\nbhojana\u1e41 t\u0101masa-priyam\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nFoods in the mode of goodness increase the duration of life, purify one\u2019s\nexistence and give strength, health, happiness and satisfaction. Such nourishing\nfoods are sweet, juicy, fattening and palatable. Foods that are too bitter, too\nsour, salty, pungent, dry and hot, are liked by people in the modes of passion.\nSuch foods cause pain, distress, and disease. Food cooked more than three hours\nbefore being eaten, which is tasteless, stale, putrid, decomposed and unclean,\nis food liked by people in the mode of ignorance.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThc purpose of food is to increase the duration of life, purify the mind and aid\nbodily strength. This is its only purpose. In the past, great authorities\nselected those foods that best aid health and increase life\u2019s duration, such as\nmilk products, sugar, rice, wheat, fruits and vegetables. These foods are very\ndear to those in the mode of goodness. Some other foods, such as baked corn and\nmolasses, while not very palatable in themselves, can be made pleasant when\nmixed with milk or other foods. They are then in the mode of goodness. All these\nfoods are pure by nature. They are quite distinct from untouchable things like\nmeat and liquor. Fatty foods, as mentioned in the eighth verse, have no\nconnection with animal fat obtained by slaughter. Animal fat is available in the\nform of milk, which is the most wonderful of all foods. Milk, butter, cheese and\nsimilar products give animal fat in a form which rules out any need for the\nkilling of innocent creatures. It is only through brute mentality that this\nkilling goes on. The civilized method of obtaining needed fat is by milk.\nSlaughter is the way of subhumans. Protein is amply available through split\npeas, dhall, whole wheat, etc.\n\n\nFoods in the mode of passion, which are bitter, too salty, or too hot or overly\nmixed with red pepper, cause misery by producing mucous in the stomach, leading\nto disease. Foods in the mode of ignorance or darkness are essentially those\nthat are not fresh. Any food cooked more than three hours before it is eaten\n(except pras\u0101dam, food offered to the Lord) is considered to be in the mode of\ndarkness. Because they are decomposing, such foods give a bad odor, which often\nattracts people in this mode but repulses those in the mode of goodness.\n\n\nRemnants of food may be eaten only when they are part of a meal that was first\noffered to the Supreme Lord or first eaten by saintly persons, especially the\nspiritual master. Otherwise the remnants of food are considered to be in the\nmode of darkness, and they increase infection or disease. Such foodstuffs,\nalthough very palatable to persons in the mode of darkness, are neither liked\nnor even touched by those in the mode of goodness. The best food is the remnant\nof what is offered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 the\nSupreme Lord says that He accepts preparations of vegetables, flour and milk\nwhen offered with devotion. Patra\u1e41 pu\u1e63pa\u1e41 phala\u1e41 toyam. Of course, devotion and\nlove are the chief things which the Supreme Personality of Godhead accepts. But\nit is also mentioned that the pras\u0101dam should be prepared in a particular way.\nAny food prepared by the injunction of the scripture offered to the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead can be taken even if prepared long, long ago, because\nsuch food is transcendental. Therefore to make food antiseptic, eatable and\npalatable for all persons, one should offer food to the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead.\n\n\n17.11\n\n\naphal\u0101k\u0101\u1e45k\u1e63ibhir yaj\u00f1o\n\n\nvidhi-di\u1e63\u1e6do ya ijyate\n\n\nya\u1e63\u1e6davyam eveti mana\u1e25\n\n\nsam\u0101dh\u0101ya sa s\u0101ttvika\u1e25\n\n\naphala-k\u0101\u00f1k\u1e63ibhi\u1e25\u2014devoid of desire for result; yaj\u00f1a\u1e25\u2014sacrifice;\nvidhi\u2014accordingly; d\u1e5b\u1e63ta\u1e25\u2014direction; ya\u1e25\u2014anyone; ijyate\u2014performs; ya\u1e63\u1e6davyam\u2014must\nbe performed; eva\u2014certainly; iti\u2014thus; mana\u1e25\u2014mind; sam\u0101dh\u0101ya\u2014fixed in; sa\u1e25\u2014he;\ns\u0101ttvika\u1e25\u2014is in the mode of goodness.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nOf sacrifices, that sacrifice performed according to duty and to scriptural\nrules, and with no expectation of reward, is of the nature of goodness.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe general tendency is to offer sacrifice with some purpose in mind, but here\nit is stated that sacrifice should be performed without any such desire. It\nshould be done as a matter of duty. Take, for example, the performance of\nrituals in temples or in churches. Generally they are performed with the purpose\nof material benefit, but that is not in the mode of goodness. One should go to a\ntemple or church as a matter of duty, offer respect to the Supreme Personality\nof Godhead and offer flowers and eatables. Everyone thinks that there is no use\nin going to the temple just to worship God. But worship for economic benefit is\nnot recommended in the scriptural injunction. One should go simply to offer\nrespect to the Deity. That will place one in the mode of goodness. It is the\nduty of every civilized man to obey the injunctions of the scriptures and offer\nrespect to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\n\n\n17.12\n\n\nabhisandh\u0101ya tu phala\u1e41\n\n\ndambh\u0101rtham api caiva yat\n\n\nijyate bharata-\u015bre\u1e63\u1e6dha\n\n\nta\u1e41 yaj\u00f1a\u1e41 viddhi r\u0101jasam\n\n\nabhisandh\u0101ya\u2014desiring; tu\u2014but; phalam\u2014the result; dambha\u2014pride; artham\u2014material\nbenefits; api\u2014also; ca\u2014and; eva\u2014certainly; yat\u2014that which; ijyate\u2014worship;\nbharata-\u015bre\u1e63\u1e6dha\u2014O chief of the Bh\u0101ratas; tam\u2014that; yaj\u00f1am\u2014sacrifice;\nviddhi\u2014know; r\u0101jasam\u2014in the mode of passion.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nBut that sacrifice performed for some material end or benefit or performed\nostentatiously, out of pride, is of the nature of passion, O chief of the\nBh\u0101ratas.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nSometimes sacrifices and rituals are performed for elevation to the heavenly\nkingdom or for some material benefits in this world.

One should\noffer, or learn to offer, respect to God or to the demigods, the perfect,\nqualified br\u0101hma\u1e47as and the spiritual master and superiors like father, mother\nor any person who is conversant with Vedic knowledge. These should be given\nproper respect. One should practice cleansing oneself externally and internally,\nand he should learn to become simple in behavior. He should not do anything\nwhich is not sanctioned by the scriptural injunction. He should not indulge in\nsex outside of married life, for sex is sanctioned in the scripture only in\nmarriage, not otherwise. This is called celibacy.

One should also recite the Vedas regularly.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nOne should not speak in such a way as to agitate the minds of others. Of course,\nwhen a teacher speaks, he can speak the truth for the instruction of his\nstudents, but such a teacher should not speak to others who are not his students\nif he will agitate their minds. This is penance as far as talking is concerned.\nBesides that, one should not talk nonsense. When speaking in spiritual circles,\none\u2019s statements must be upheld by the scriptures. One should at once quote from\nscriptural authority to back up what he is saying. At the same time, such talk\nshould be very pleasurable to the ear. By such discussions, one may derive the\nhighest benefit and elevate human society. There is a limitless stock of Vedic\nliterature, and one should study this. This is called penance of speech.\n\n\n17.16\n\n\nmana\u1e25-pras\u0101da\u1e25 saumyatva\u1e41\n\n\nmaunam \u0101tma-vinigraha\u1e25\n\n\nbh\u0101va-sa\u1e41\u015buddhir ity etat\n\n\ntapo m\u0101nasam ucyate\n\n\nmana\u1e25-pras\u0101da\u1e25\u2014satisfaction of the mind; saumyatvam\u2014without duplicity towards\nothers; maunam\u2014gravity; \u0101tma\u2014self; vinigraha\u1e25\u2014control; bh\u0101va\u2014nature;\nsa\u1e41\u015buddhi\u1e25\u2014purification; iti\u2014thus; etat\u2014that is; tapa\u1e25\u2014austerity; m\u0101nasam\u2014of the\nmind; ucyate\u2014is said to be.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nAnd serenity, simplicity, gravity, self-control and purity of thought are the\nausterities of the mind.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nTo make the mind austere is to detach it from sense gratification. It should be\nso trained that it can be always thinking of doing good for others. The best\ntraining for the mind is gravity in thought. One should not deviate from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness and must always avoid sense gratification. To purify one\u2019s nature\nis to become K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious. Satisfaction of the mind can be obtained only by\ntaking the mind away from thoughts of sense enjoyment. The more we think of\nsense enjoyment, the more the mind becomes dissatisfied. In the present age we\nunnecessarily engage the mind in so many different ways for sense gratification,\nand so there is no possibility of the mind\u2019s becoming satisfied. The best course\nis to divert the mind to the Vedic literature, which is full of satisfying\nstories, as in the Pur\u0101\u1e47as and the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata. One can take advantage of this\nknowledge and thus become purified. The mind should be devoid of duplicity, and\none should think of the welfare of all. Silence means that one is always\nthinking of self-realization. The person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness observes perfect\nsilence in this sense. Control of the mind means detaching the mind from sense\nenjoyment. One should be straightforward in his dealing and thereby purify his\nexistence. All these qualities together constitute austerity in mental\nactivities.\n\n\n17.17\n\n\n\u015braddhay\u0101 paray\u0101 tapta\u1e41\n\n\ntapas tat tri-vidha\u1e41 narai\u1e25\n\n\naphal\u0101k\u0101\u1e45k\u1e63ibhir yuktai\u1e25\n\n\ns\u0101ttvika\u1e41 paricak\u1e63ate\n\n\n\u015braddhay\u0101\u2014with faith; paray\u0101\u2014transcendental; taptam\u2014executed; tapa\u1e25\u2014austerity;\ntat\u2014that; tri-vidham\u2014three kinds; narai\u1e25\u2014by men; aphala-\u0101k\u0101\u1e45k\u1e63ibhi\u1e25\u2014without\ndesires for fruits; yuktai\u1e25\u2014engaged; s\u0101ttvikam\u2014in the mode of goodness;\npari-cak\u1e63ate\u2014is called.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThis threefold austerity, practiced by men whose aim is not to benefit\nthemselves materially but to please the Supreme, is of the nature of goodness.\n\n\n17.18\n\n\nsatk\u0101ra-m\u0101na-p\u016bj\u0101rtha\u1e41\n\n\ntapo dambhena caiva yat\n\n\nkriyate tad iha prokta\u1e41\n\n\nr\u0101jasa\u1e41 calam adhruvam\n\n\nsatk\u0101ra\u2014respect; m\u0101na\u2014honor; p\u016bj\u0101-artham\u2014for worship; tapa\u1e25\u2014austerity;\ndambhena\u2014with pride; ca\u2014also; eva\u2014certainly; yat\u2014which is; kriyate\u2014performed;\ntat\u2014that; iha\u2014in this world; proktam\u2014is said; r\u0101jasam\u2014in the mode of passion;\ncalam\u2014flickering; adhruvam\u2014temporary.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThose ostentatious penances and austerities which are performed in order to gain\nrespect, honor and reverence are said to be in the mode of passion.

Only charity in the mode of goodness is recommended.\n\n\n17.22\n\n\nade\u015ba-k\u0101le yad d\u0101nam\n\n\nap\u0101trebhya\u015b ca d\u012byate\n\n\nasat-k\u1e5btam avaj\u00f1\u0101ta\u1e41\n\n\ntat t\u0101masam ud\u0101h\u1e5btam\n\n\nadesa\u2014unpurified place; k\u0101le\u2014unpurified time; yat\u2014that which is; d\u0101nam\u2014charity;\nap\u0101trebhya\u1e25\u2014to unworthy persons; ca\u2014also; d\u012byate\u2014is given; asatk\u1e5btam\u2014without\nrespect; avaj\u00f1\u0101tam\u2014without proper attention; tat\u2014that; t\u0101masam\u2014in the mode of\ndarkness; ud\u0101h\u1e5btam\u2014is said to be.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nAnd charity performed at an improper place and time and given to unworthy\npersons without respect and with contempt is charity in the mode of ignorance.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nContributions for indulgence in intoxication and gambling are not encouraged\nhere.

They were uttered by br\u0101hma\u1e47as\nwhile chanting Vedic hymns and during sacrifices, for the satisfaction of the\nSupreme.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nIt has been explained that penance, sacrifice, charity and foods are divided\ninto three categories: the modes of goodness, passion and ignorance. But whether\nfirst class, second class or third class, they are all conditioned, contaminated\nby the material modes of nature. When they are aimed at the Supreme\u2014om tat sat,\nthe Supreme Personality of Godhead, the eternal\u2014they become means for spiritual\nelevation. In the scriptural injunctions such an objective is indicated. These\nthree words, om tat sat, particularly indicate the Absolute Truth, the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead. In the Vedic hymns, the word om is always found.\n\n\nOne who acts without following the regulations of the scriptures will not attain\nthe Absolute Truth. He will get some temporary result, but not the ultimate end\nof life. The conclusion is that the performance of charities, sacrifice and\npenance must be done in the mode of goodness. Performed in the modes of passion\nor ignorance, they are certainly inferior in quality. The three words om tat sat\nare uttered in conjunction with the holy name of the Supreme Lord, e.g., om tad\nvi\u1e63\u1e47o\u1e25. Whenever a Vedic hymn or the holy name of the Supreme Lord is uttered,\nom is added. This is the indication of Vedic literature. These three words are\ntaken from Vedic hymns. Om ity etad brahma\u1e47o nedi\u1e63\u1e6da\u1e41 n\u0101ma indicates the first\ngoal. Then tattvamasi indicates the second goal. And sad eva saumya indicates\nthe third goal. Combined they become om tat sat. Formerly when Brahm\u0101, the first\ncreated living entity, performed sacrifices, he spoke these three names of the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead. The same principle holds by disciplic\nsuccession. So this hymn has great significance. Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 recommends,\ntherefore, that any work done should be done for om tat sat, or for the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead. When one performs penance, charity, and sacrifice with\nthese three words, he is acting in Kr\u1e63na consciousness. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is a\nscientific execution of transcendental activities which enables one to return\nhome, back to Godhead. There is no loss of energy in acting in such a\ntranscendental way.\n\n\n17.24\n\n\ntasm\u0101d o\u1e41 ity ud\u0101h\u1e5btya\n\n\nyaj\u00f1a-d\u0101na-tapa\u1e25-kriy\u0101\u1e25\n\n\npravartante vidh\u0101nokt\u0101\u1e25\n\n\nsatata\u1e41 brahma-v\u0101din\u0101m\n\n\ntasm\u0101t\u2014therefore; om\u2014beginning with om; iti\u2014thus; ud\u0101h\u1e5btya\u2014indicating;\nyaj\u00f1a\u2014sacrifice; d\u0101na\u2014charity; tapa\u1e25\u2014penance; kriy\u0101\u1e25\u2014performances;\npravartante\u2014begins; vidh\u0101na-ukt\u0101\u1e25\u2014according to scriptural regulation;\nsatatam\u2014always; brahma-v\u0101din\u0101m\u2014of the transcendentalists.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThus the transcendentalists undertake sacrifices, charities, and penances,\nbeginning always with om, to attain the Supreme.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nOm tad vi\u1e63\u1e47o\u1e25 parama\u1e41 padam.

These works of sacrifice, of penance and of charity, true to\nthe absolute nature, are performed to please the Supreme Person, O son of P\u1e5bth\u0101.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe words pra\u015baste karma\u1e47i, or prescribed duties, indicate that there are many\nactivities prescribed in the Vedic literature which are purificatory processes\nbeginning from parental care up to the end of one\u2019s life. Such purificatory\nprocesses are adopted for the ultimate liberation of the living entity. In all\nsuch activities it is recommended that one should vibrate om tat sat. The words\nsad-bh\u0101ve and s\u0101dhu-bh\u0101ve indicate the transcendental situation. One who is\nacting in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is called sattva, and one who is fully conscious\nof activities in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is called svar\u016bpa. In the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam\nit is said that the transcendental subject matter becomes clear in the\nassociation of the devotees. Without good association, one cannot achieve\ntranscendental knowledge. When initiating a person or offering the sacred\nthread, one vibrates the words om tat sat. Similarly, in all kinds of yogic\nperformances, the supreme object, om tat sat is invoked. These words om tat sat\nare used to perfect all activities. This supreme om tat sat makes everything\ncomplete.\n\n\n17.28\n\n\na\u015braddhay\u0101 huta\u1e41 datta\u1e41\n\n\ntapas tapta\u1e41 k\u1e5bta\u1e41 ca yat\n\n\nasad ity ucyate p\u0101rtha\n\n\nna ca tat pretya no iha\n\n\na\u015braddhay\u0101\u2014without faith; hutam\u2014performed; dattam\u2014given; tapa\u1e25\u2014penance;\ntaptam\u2014executed; k\u1e5btam\u2014performed; ca\u2014also; yat\u2014that which; asat\u2014falls; iti\u2014thus;\nucyate\u2014is said to be; p\u0101rtha\u2014O son of P\u1e5bth\u0101; na\u2014never; ca\u2014also; tat\u2014that;\npretya\u2014after death; no\u2014nor; iha\u2014in this life.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nBut sacrifices, austerities and charities performed without faith in the Supreme\nare nonpermanent, O son of P\u1e5bth\u0101, regardless of whatever rites are performed.\nThey are called asat and are useless both in this life and the next.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nAnything done without the transcendental objective\u2014whether it be sacrifice,\ncharity or penance-is useless. Therefore, in this verse, it is declared that\nsuch activities are abominable. Everything should be done for the Supreme in\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Without such faith, and without the proper guidance, there\ncan never be any fruit. In all the Vedic scriptures, faith in the Supreme is\nadvised. In the pursuit of all Vedic instructions, the ultimate goal is the\nunderstanding of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. No one can obtain success without following this\nprinciple. Therefore, the best course is to work from the very beginning in\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness under the guidance of a bona fide spiritual master. That is\nthe way to make everything successful.\n\n\nIn the conditional state, people are attracted to worship demigods, ghosts, or\nYak\u1e63as like Kuvera. The mode of goodness is better than the modes of passion and\nignorance, but one who takes directly to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is transcendental\nto all three modes of material nature. Although there is a process of gradual\nelevation, if one, by the association of pure devotees, takes directly to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness, that is the best way. And that is recommended in this chapter. To\nachieve success in this way, one must first find the proper spiritual master and\nreceive training under his direction. Then one can achieve faith in the Supreme.\nWhen that faith matures, in course of time, it is called love of God. This love\nis the ultimate goal of the living entities. One should, therefore, take to\nKr\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness directly. That is the message of this Seventeenth Chapter.",

PURPORT  In the Fourth Chapter, thirty-ninth verse, it is said that a person faithful to\na particular type of worship gradually becomes elevated to the stage of\nknowledge and attains the highest perfectional stage of peace and prosperity. In\nthe Sixteenth Chapter, it is concluded that one who does not follow the\nprinciples laid down in the scriptures is called an asura, demon, and one who\nfollows the scriptural injunctions faithfully is called a deva, or demigod. Now,\nif one, with faith, follows some rules which are not mentioned in the scriptural\ninjunctions, what is his position? This doubt of Arjuna is to be cleared by\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.

TRANSLATION  According to one\u2019s existence under the various modes of nature, one evolves a\nparticular kind of faith. The living being is said to be of a particular faith\naccording to the modes he has acquired.  PURPORT  Everyone has a particular type of faith, regardless of what he is. But his faith\nis considered good, passionate or ignorant according to the nature he has\nacquired. Thus, according to his particular type of faith, one associates with\ncertain persons. Now the real fact is that every living being, as is stated in\nthe Fifteenth Chapter, is originally the fragmental part and parcel of the\nSupreme Lord. Therefore one is originally transcendental to all the modes of\nmaterial nature. But when one forgets his relationship with the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead and comes into contact with the material nature in\nconditional life, he generates his own position by association with the\ndifferent varieties of material nature. The resultant artificial faith and\nexistence are only material. Although one may be conducted by some impression,\nor some conception of life, still, originally, he is nirgu\u1e47a, or transcendental.\nTherefore one has to become cleansed of the material contamination that he has\nacquired in order to regain his relationship with the Supreme Lord. That is the\nonly path back without fear: K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. If one is situated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness, then that path is guaranteed for his elevation to the\nperfectional stage. If one does not take to this path of self-realization, then\nhe is surely to be conducted by the influence of the modes of nature.  The word sattva, or faith, is very significant in this verse. Sattva or faith\nalways comes out of the works of goodness. One\u2019s faith may be in a demigod or\nsome created God or some mental concoction. It is supposed to be one\u2019s strong\nfaith in something that is productive of the works of material goodness. But in\nmaterial conditional life, no works of material nature are completely purified.\nThey are mixed. They are not in pure goodness. Pure goodness is transcendental;\nin purified goodness one can understand the real nature of the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead. As long as one\u2019s faith is not completely in purified\ngoodness, the faith is subject to contamination by any of the modes of material\nnature. The contaminated modes of material nature expand to the heart. Therefore\naccording to the position of the heart in contact with a particular mode of\nmaterial nature, one\u2019s faith is established. It should be understood, that if\none\u2019s heart is in the mode of goodness, his faith is also in the mode of\ngoodness. If his heart is in the mode of passion, his faith is also in the mode\nof passion. And if his heart is in the mode of darkness, illusion, his faith is\nalso thus contaminated. Thus we find different types of faith in this world, and\nthere are different types of religions due to different types of faith. The real\nprinciple of religious faith is situated in the mode of pure goodness, but\nbecause the heart is tainted, we find different types of religious principles.\nThus according to different types of faith, there are different kinds of\nworship.",

TRANSLATION  Men in the mode of goodness worship the demigods; those in the mode of passion\nworship the demons; and those in the mode of ignorance worship ghosts and\nspirits.  PURPORT  In this verse the Supreme Personality of Godhead describes different kinds of\nworshipers according to their external activities. According to scriptural\ninjunction, only the Supreme Personality of Godhead is worshipable, but those\nwho are not very conversant with, or faithful to, the scriptural injunctions\nworship different objects, according to their specific situations in the modes\nof material nature. Those who are situated in goodness generally worship the\ndemigods. The demigods include Brahm\u0101, \u015aiva and others such as Indra, Candra and\nthe sun-god. There are various demigods. Those in goodness worship a particular\ndemigod for a particular purpose. Similarly, those who are in the mode of\npassion worship the demons. We recall that during the Second World War, a man in\nCalcutta worshiped Hitler because thanks to that war he had amassed a large\namount of wealth by dealing in the black market. Similarly, those in the modes\nof passion and ignorance generally select a powerful man to be God. They think\nthat anyone can be worshiped as God and that the same results will be obtained.  Now, it is clearly described here that those who are in the mode of passion\nworship and create such gods, and those who are in the mode of ignorance, in\ndarkness, worship dead spirits. Sometimes people worship at the tomb of some\ndead man. Sexual service is also considered to be in the mode of darkness.\nSimilarly, in remote villages in India there are worshipers of ghosts. We have\nseen that in India the lower class people sometimes go to the forest, and if\nthey have knowledge that a ghost lives in a tree, they worship that tree and\noffer sacrifices. These different kinds of worship are not actually God worship.\nGod worship is for persons who are transcendentally situated in pure goodness.\nIn the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam it is said, sattva\u1e41 vi\u015buddham v\u0101sudeva-\u015babditam. \u201cWhen\na man is situated in pure goodness, he worships V\u0101sudeva.\u201d The purport is that\nthose who are completely purified of the material modes of nature and who are\ntranscendentally situated can worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead.  The impersonalists are supposed to be situated in the mode of goodness, and they\nworship five kinds of demigods. They worship the impersonal Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, or Vi\u1e63\u1e47u form\nin the material world, which is known as philosophized Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is the\nexpansion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but the impersonalists, because\nthey do not ultimately believe in the Supreme Personality of Godhead, imagine\nthat the Vi\u1e63\u1e47u form is just another aspect of the impersonal Brahman; similarly,\nthey imagine that Lord Brahm\u0101 is the impersonal form in the material mode of\npassion. Thus they sometimes describe five kinds of gods that are worshipable,\nbut because they think that the actual truth is impersonal Brahman, they dispose\nof all worshipable objects at the ultimate end. In conclusion, the different\nqualities of the material modes of nature can be purified through association\nwith persons who are of transcendental nature.",

TRANSLATION  Those who undergo severe austerities and penances not recommended in the\nscriptures, performing them out of pride, egotism, lust and attachment, who are\nimpelled by passion and who torture their bodily organs as well as the Supersoul\ndwelling within are to be known as demons.  PURPORT  There are persons who manufacture modes of austerity and penances which are not\nmentioned in the scriptural injunctions. For instance, fasting for some ulterior\npurpose, such as to promote a purely political end, is not mentioned in the\nscriptural directions. The scriptures recommend fasting for spiritual\nadvancement, not for some political end or social purpose. Persons who take to\nsuch austerities are, according to Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, certainly demoniac. Their acts\nare against the scriptural injunction and are not beneficial for the people in\ngeneral. Actually, they act out of pride, false ego, lust and attachment for\nmaterial enjoyment. By such activities, not only are the combination of material\nelements of which the body is constructed disturbed, but also the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead Himself living within the body. Such unauthorized fasting\nor austerities for some political end are certainly very disturbing to others.\nThey are not mentioned in the Vedic literature. A demoniac person may think that\nhe can force his enemy or other parties to comply with his desire by this\nmethod, but sometimes one dies by such fasting. These acts are not approved by\nthe Supreme Personality of Godhead, and He says that those who engage in them\nare demons. Such demonstrations are insults to the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead because they are enacted in disobedience to the Vedic scriptural\ninjunctions. The word acetasa\u1e25 is significant in this connection\u2014persons of\nnormal mental condition must obey the scriptural injunctions. Those who are not\nin such a position neglect and disobey the scriptures and manufacture their own\nway of austerities and penances. One should always remember the ultimate end of\nthe demoniac people, as described in the previous chapter. The Lord forces them\nto take birth in the womb of demoniac persons. Consequently they will live by\ndemoniac principles life after life without knowing their relationship with the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead. If, however, such persons are fortunate enough\nto be guided by a spiritual master who can direct them to the path of Vedic\nwisdom, they can get out of this entanglement and ultimately achieve the supreme\ngoal.",

Such nourishing\nfoods are sweet, juicy, fattening and palatable. Foods that are too bitter, too\nsour, salty, pungent, dry and hot, are liked by people in the modes of passion.\nSuch foods cause pain, distress, and disease. Food cooked more than three hours\nbefore being eaten, which is tasteless, stale, putrid, decomposed and unclean,\nis food liked by people in the mode of ignorance.  PURPORT  Thc purpose of food is to increase the duration of life, purify the mind and aid\nbodily strength. This is its only purpose. In the past, great authorities\nselected those foods that best aid health and increase life\u2019s duration, such as\nmilk products, sugar, rice, wheat, fruits and vegetables. These foods are very\ndear to those in the mode of goodness. Some other foods, such as baked corn and\nmolasses, while not very palatable in themselves, can be made pleasant when\nmixed with milk or other foods. They are then in the mode of goodness. All these\nfoods are pure by nature. They are quite distinct from untouchable things like\nmeat and liquor. Fatty foods, as mentioned in the eighth verse, have no\nconnection with animal fat obtained by slaughter. Animal fat is available in the\nform of milk, which is the most wonderful of all foods. Milk, butter, cheese and\nsimilar products give animal fat in a form which rules out any need for the\nkilling of innocent creatures. It is only through brute mentality that this\nkilling goes on. The civilized method of obtaining needed fat is by milk.\nSlaughter is the way of subhumans. Protein is amply available through split\npeas, dhall, whole wheat, etc.  Foods in the mode of passion, which are bitter, too salty, or too hot or overly\nmixed with red pepper, cause misery by producing mucous in the stomach, leading\nto disease. Foods in the mode of ignorance or darkness are essentially those\nthat are not fresh. Any food cooked more than three hours before it is eaten\n(except pras\u0101dam, food offered to the Lord) is considered to be in the mode of\ndarkness. Because they are decomposing, such foods give a bad odor, which often\nattracts people in this mode but repulses those in the mode of goodness.  Remnants of food may be eaten only when they are part of a meal that was first\noffered to the Supreme Lord or first eaten by saintly persons, especially the\nspiritual master. Otherwise the remnants of food are considered to be in the\nmode of darkness, and they increase infection or disease. Such foodstuffs,\nalthough very palatable to persons in the mode of darkness, are neither liked\nnor even touched by those in the mode of goodness. The best food is the remnant\nof what is offered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 the\nSupreme Lord says that He accepts preparations of vegetables, flour and milk\nwhen offered with devotion. Patra\u1e41 pu\u1e63pa\u1e41 phala\u1e41 toyam. Of course, devotion and\nlove are the chief things which the Supreme Personality of Godhead accepts. But\nit is also mentioned that the pras\u0101dam should be prepared in a particular way.\nAny food prepared by the injunction of the scripture offered to the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead can be taken even if prepared long, long ago, because\nsuch food is transcendental. Therefore to make food antiseptic, eatable and\npalatable for all persons, one should offer food to the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead.",

It should be\nso trained that it can be always thinking of doing good for others. The best\ntraining for the mind is gravity in thought. One should not deviate from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness and must always avoid sense gratification. To purify one\u2019s nature\nis to become K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious. Satisfaction of the mind can be obtained only by\ntaking the mind away from thoughts of sense enjoyment. The more we think of\nsense enjoyment, the more the mind becomes dissatisfied. In the present age we\nunnecessarily engage the mind in so many different ways for sense gratification,\nand so there is no possibility of the mind\u2019s becoming satisfied. The best course\nis to divert the mind to the Vedic literature, which is full of satisfying\nstories, as in the Pur\u0101\u1e47as and the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata. One can take advantage of this\nknowledge and thus become purified. The mind should be devoid of duplicity, and\none should think of the welfare of all. Silence means that one is always\nthinking of self-realization. The person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness observes perfect\nsilence in this sense. Control of the mind means detaching the mind from sense\nenjoyment. One should be straightforward in his dealing and thereby purify his\nexistence. All these qualities together constitute austerity in mental\nactivities.",

TRANSLATION  From the beginning of creation, the three syllables\u2014om tat sat\u2014have been used to\nindicate the Supreme Absolute Truth [Brahman]. They were uttered by br\u0101hma\u1e47as\nwhile chanting Vedic hymns and during sacrifices, for the satisfaction of the\nSupreme.  PURPORT  It has been explained that penance, sacrifice, charity and foods are divided\ninto three categories: the modes of goodness, passion and ignorance. But whether\nfirst class, second class or third class, they are all conditioned, contaminated\nby the material modes of nature. When they are aimed at the Supreme\u2014om tat sat,\nthe Supreme Personality of Godhead, the eternal\u2014they become means for spiritual\nelevation. In the scriptural injunctions such an objective is indicated. These\nthree words, om tat sat, particularly indicate the Absolute Truth, the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead. In the Vedic hymns, the word om is always found.  One who acts without following the regulations of the scriptures will not attain\nthe Absolute Truth. He will get some temporary result, but not the ultimate end\nof life. The conclusion is that the performance of charities, sacrifice and\npenance must be done in the mode of goodness. Performed in the modes of passion\nor ignorance, they are certainly inferior in quality. The three words om tat sat\nare uttered in conjunction with the holy name of the Supreme Lord, e.g., om tad\nvi\u1e63\u1e47o\u1e25. Whenever a Vedic hymn or the holy name of the Supreme Lord is uttered,\nom is added. This is the indication of Vedic literature. These three words are\ntaken from Vedic hymns. Om ity etad brahma\u1e47o nedi\u1e63\u1e6da\u1e41 n\u0101ma indicates the first\ngoal. Then tattvamasi indicates the second goal. And sad eva saumya indicates\nthe third goal. Combined they become om tat sat. Formerly when Brahm\u0101, the first\ncreated living entity, performed sacrifices, he spoke these three names of the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead. The same principle holds by disciplic\nsuccession. So this hymn has great significance. Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 recommends,\ntherefore, that any work done should be done for om tat sat, or for the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead. When one performs penance, charity, and sacrifice with\nthese three words, he is acting in Kr\u1e63na consciousness. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is a\nscientific execution of transcendental activities which enables one to return\nhome, back to Godhead. There is no loss of energy in acting in such a\ntranscendental way.",

Therefore, in this verse, it is declared that\nsuch activities are abominable. Everything should be done for the Supreme in\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Without such faith, and without the proper guidance, there\ncan never be any fruit. In all the Vedic scriptures, faith in the Supreme is\nadvised. In the pursuit of all Vedic instructions, the ultimate goal is the\nunderstanding of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. No one can obtain success without following this\nprinciple. Therefore, the best course is to work from the very beginning in\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness under the guidance of a bona fide spiritual master. That is\nthe way to make everything successful.  In the conditional state, people are attracted to worship demigods, ghosts, or\nYak\u1e63as like Kuvera. The mode of goodness is better than the modes of passion and\nignorance, but one who takes directly to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is transcendental\nto all three modes of material nature. Although there is a process of gradual\nelevation, if one, by the association of pure devotees, takes directly to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness, that is the best way. And that is recommended in this chapter. To\nachieve success in this way, one must first find the proper spiritual master and\nreceive training under his direction. Then one can achieve faith in the Supreme.\nWhen that faith matures, in course of time, it is called love of God. This love\nis the ultimate goal of the living entities. One should, therefore, take to\nKr\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness directly. That is the message of this Seventeenth Chapter.",

The Eighteenth\nChapter is a supplementary summarization of the topics discussed before. In\nevery chapter of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a stresses that devotional service unto\nthe Supreme Personality of Godhead is the ultimate goal of life. This same point\nis summarized in the Eighteenth Chapter as the most confidential path of\nknowledge. In the first six chapters, stress was given to devotional service:\nyogin\u0101m api sarve\u1e63\u0101m\u2026 \u201cOf all yog\u012bs or transcendentalists, one who always thinks\nof Me within himself is best.\u201d In the next six chapters, pure devotional service\nand its nature and activity were discussed. In the third six chapters,\nknowledge, renunciation, the activities of material nature and transcendental\nnature, and devotional service were described. It was concluded that all acts\nshould be performed in conjunction with the Supreme Lord, summarized by the\nwords om tat sat, which indicate Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, the Supreme Person. In the third part of\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, devotional service was established by the example of past \u0101c\u0101ryas\n\n\nand the Brahma-s\u016btra, the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra, which cites that devotional service is\nthe ultimate purpose of life and nothing else. Certain impersonalists consider\nthemselves monopolizers of the knowledge of Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra, but actually the\nVed\u0101nta-s\u016btra is meant for understanding devotional service, for the Lord\nHimself is the composer of the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra, and He is its knower. That is\ndescribed in the Fifteenth Chapter. In every scripture, every Veda, devotional\nservice is the objective. That is explained in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.\n\n\nAs in the Second Chapter a synopsis of the whole subject matter was described,\nsimilarly, in the Eighteenth Chapter also the summary of all instruction is\ngiven. The purpose of life is indicated to be renunciation and attainment of the\ntranscendental position above the three material modes of nature. Arjuna wants\nto clarify the two distinct subject matters of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, namely\nrenunciation (ty\u0101ga) and the renounced order of life (sanny\u0101sa). Thus he is\nasking the meaning of these two words.\n\n\nTwo words used in this verse to address the Supreme Lord\u2014H\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba and\nKe\u015binis\u016bdana\u2014are significant. H\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the master of all senses, who\ncan always help us attain mental serenity. Arjuna requests Him to summarize\neverything in such a way that he can remain equiposed. Yet he has some doubts,\nand doubts are always compared to demons. He therefore addresses K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as\nKe\u015binis\u016bdana. Ke\u015b\u012b was a most formidable demon who was killed by the Lord; now\nArjuna is expecting K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to kill the demon of doubt.\n\n\n18.2\n\n\n\u015br\u012b-bhagav\u0101n uv\u0101ca\n\n\nk\u0101my\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 karma\u1e47\u0101\u1e41 ny\u0101sa\u1e41\n\n\nsanny\u0101sa\u1e41 kavayo vidu\u1e25\n\n\nsarva-karma-phala-ty\u0101ga\u1e41\n\n\npr\u0101hus ty\u0101ga\u1e41 vicak\u1e63a\u1e47\u0101\u1e25\n\n\n\u015br\u012b bhagav\u0101n uv\u0101ca\u2014the Supreme Personality of Godhead said; k\u0101my\u0101n\u0101m\u2014with\ndesire; karma\u1e47\u0101m\u2014activities; ny\u0101sam\u2014renunciation; sanny\u0101sam\u2014renounced order of\nlife; kavaya\u1e25\u2014the learned; vidu\u1e25\u2014know; sarva\u2014all; karma\u2014activities; phala\u2014of\nresults; ty\u0101gam\u2014renunciation; pr\u0101hu\u1e25\u2014call; ty\u0101gam\u2014renunciation; vicak\u1e63a\u1e47\u0101\u1e25\u2014the\nexperienced.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThe Supreme Lord said, To give up the results of all activities is called\nrenunciation [ty\u0101ga] by the wise. And that state is called the renounced order\nof life [sanny\u0101sa] by great learned men.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe performance of activities for results has to be given up. This is the\ninstruction of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. But activities leading to advanced spiritual\nknowledge are not to be given up. This will be made clear in the next verse.\nThere are many prescriptions of methods for performing sacrifice for some\nparticular purpose in the Vedic literatures. There are certain sacrifices to\nperform to attain a good son or to attain elevation to the higher planets, but\nsacrifices prompted by desires should be stopped. However, sacrifice for the\npurification of one\u2019s heart or for advancement in the spiritual science should\nnot be given up.\n\n\n18.3\n\n\nty\u0101jya\u1e41 do\u1e63a-vad ity eke\n\n\nkarma pr\u0101hur man\u012b\u1e63i\u1e47a\u1e25\n\n\nyaj\u00f1a-d\u0101na-tapa\u1e25-karma\n\n\nna ty\u0101jyam iti c\u0101pare\n\n\nty\u0101jyam\u2014must be given up; do\u1e63avat\u2014as an evil; iti\u2014thus; eke\u2014one group;\nkarma\u2014work; pr\u0101hu\u1e25\u2014said; man\u012b\u1e63i\u1e47a\u1e25\u2014of great thinkers; yaj\u00f1a\u2014sacrifice;\nd\u0101na\u2014charity; tapa\u1e25\u2014penance; karma\u2014work; na\u2014never; ty\u0101jyam\u2014is to be given up;\niti\u2014thus; ca\u2014certainly; apare\u2014others.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nSome learned men declare that all kinds of fruitive activities should be given\nup, but there are yet other sages who maintain that acts of sacrifice, charity\nand penance should never be abandoned.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThere are many activities in the Vedic literatures which are subjects of\ncontention. For instance, it is said that an animal can be killed in a\nsacrifice, yet some maintain animal killing is completely abominable. Although\nanimal killing in a sacrifice is recommended in the Vedic literature, the animal\nis not considered to be killed. The sacrifice is to give a new life to the\nanimal. Sometimes the animal is given a new animal life after being killed in\nthe sacrifice, and sometimes the animal is promoted immediately to the human\nform of life. But there are different opinions among the sages. Some say that\nanimal killing should always be avoided, and others say that for a specific\nsacrifice it is good. All these different opinions on sacrificial activity are\nnow being clarified by the Lord Himself.\n\n\n18.4\n\n\nni\u015bcaya\u1e41 \u015b\u1e5b\u1e47u me tatra\n\n\nty\u0101ge bharata-sattama\n\n\nty\u0101go hi puru\u1e63a-vy\u0101ghra\n\n\ntri-vidha\u1e25 samprak\u012brtita\u1e25\n\n\nni\u015bcayam\u2014certainly; \u015b\u1e5b\u1e47u\u2014hear; me\u2014from Me; tatra\u2014there; ty\u0101ge\u2014in the matter of\nrenunciation; bharata-sattama\u2014O best of the Bh\u0101ratas; ty\u0101ga\u1e25\u2014renunciation;\nhi\u2014certainly; puru\u1e63a-vy\u0101ghra\u2014O tiger among human beings; tri-vidha\u1e25\u2014three kinds;\nsamprak\u012brtita\u1e25\u2014is declared.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nO best of the Bh\u0101ratas, hear from Me now about renunciation. O tiger among men,\nthere are three kinds of renunciation declared in the scriptures.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nAlthough there are differences of opinion about renunciation, here the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, gives His judgment, which should be taken as\nfinal. After all, the Vedas are different laws given by the Lord. Here the Lord\nis personally present, and His word should be taken as final. The Lord says that\nthe process of renunciation should be considered in terms of the modes of\nmaterial nature in which they are performed.\n\n\n18.5\n\n\nyaj\u00f1a-d\u0101na-tapa\u1e25-karma\n\n\nna ty\u0101jya\u1e41 k\u0101ryam eva tat\n\n\nyaj\u00f1o d\u0101na\u1e41 tapa\u015b caiva\n\n\np\u0101van\u0101ni man\u012b\u1e63i\u1e47\u0101m\n\n\nyaj\u00f1a\u2014sacrifice; d\u0101na\u2014charity; tapa\u1e25\u2014penance; karma\u2014activities; na\u2014never;\nty\u0101jyam\u2014to be given up; k\u0101ryam\u2014must be done; eva\u2014certainly; tat\u2014that;\nyaj\u00f1a\u1e25\u2014sacrifice; d\u0101nam\u2014charity; tapa\u1e25\u2014penance; ca\u2014also; eva\u2014certainly;\np\u0101van\u0101ni\u2014purifying; man\u012b\u1e63i\u1e47\u0101m\u2014even of the great souls.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nActs of sacrifice, charity and penance are not to be given up but should be\nperformed. Indeed, sacrifice, charity and penance purify even the great souls.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe yog\u012bs should perform acts for the advancement of human society. There are\nmany purificatory processes for advancing a human being to spiritual life. The\nmarriage ceremony, for example, is considered to be one of these sacrifices. It\nis called viv\u0101ha-yaj\u00f1a. Should a sanny\u0101s\u012b, who is in the renounced order of life\nand who has given up his family relations, encourage the marriage ceremony? The\nLord says here that any sacrifice which is meant for human welfare should never\nbe given up. Viv\u0101ha-yaj\u00f1a, the marriage ceremony, is meant to regulate the human\nmind to become peaceful for spiritual advancement. For most men, this\nviv\u0101ha-yaj\u00f1a should be encouraged even by persons in the renounced order of\nlife. Sannyas\u012bs should never associate with women, but that does not mean that\none who is in the lower stages of life, a young man, should not accept a wife in\nthe marriage ceremony. All prescribed sacrifices are meant for achieving the\nSupreme Lord. Therefore, in the lower stages, they should not be given up.\nSimilarly, charity is for the purification of the heart. If charity is given to\nsuitable persons, as described previously, it leads one to advanced spiritual\nlife.\n\n\n18.6\n\n\net\u0101ny api tu karm\u0101\u1e47i\n\n\nsa\u1e45ga\u1e41 tyaktv\u0101 phal\u0101ni ca\n\n\nkartavy\u0101n\u012bti me p\u0101rtha\n\n\nni\u015bcita\u1e41 matam uttamam\n\n\net\u0101ni\u2014all this; api\u2014certainly; tu\u2014must; karm\u0101\u1e47i\u2014activities; sa\u1e45gam\u2014association;\ntyaktv\u0101\u2014renouncing; phal\u0101ni\u2014results; ca\u2014also; kartavy\u0101ni\u2014as duty; iti\u2014thus;\nme\u2014My; p\u0101rtha\u2014O son of P\u1e5bth\u0101; ni\u015bcitam\u2014definite; matam\u2014opinion; uttamam\u2014the\nbest.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nAll these activities should be performed without any expectation of result. They\nshould be performed as a matter of duty, O son of P\u1e5bth\u0101. That is My final\nopinion.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nAlthough all sacrifices are purifying, one should not expect any result by such\nperformances. In other words, all sacrifices which are meant for material\nadvancement in life should be given up, but sacrifices that purify one\u2019s\nexistence and elevate one to the spiritual plane should not be stopped.\nEverything that leads to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness must be encouraged. In the\n\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam also it is said that any activity which leads to devotional\nservice to the Lord should be accepted. That is the highest criterion of\nreligion. A devotee of the Lord should accept any kind of work, sacrifice, or\ncharity which will help him in the discharge of devotional service to the Lord\n\n\n18.7\n\n\nniyatasya tu sanny\u0101sa\u1e25\n\n\nkarma\u1e47o nopapadyate\n\n\nmoh\u0101t tasya parity\u0101gas\n\n\nt\u0101masa\u1e25 parik\u012brtita\u1e25\n\n\nniyatasya\u2014prescribed duties; tu\u2014but; sanny\u0101sa\u1e25\u2014renunciation;\nkarma\u1e47a\u1e25\u2014activities; na\u2014never; upapadyate\u2014is deserved; moh\u0101t\u2014by illusion;\ntasya\u2014of which; parity\u0101ga\u1e25\u2014renunciation; t\u0101masa\u1e25\u2014in the mode of ignorance;\nparik\u012brtita\u1e25\u2014declared.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nPrescribed duties should never be renounced. If, by illusion, one gives up his\nprescribed duties, such renunciation is said to be in the mode of ignorance.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nWork for material satisfaction must be given up, but activities which promote\none to spiritual activity, like cooking for the Supreme Lord and offering the\nfood to the Lord and then accepting the food, are recommended. It is said that a\nperson in the renounced order of life should not cook for himself. Cooking for\noneself is prohibited, but cooking for the Supreme Lord is not prohibited.\nSimilarly, a sanny\u0101s\u012b may perform a marriage ceremony to help his disciple in\nthe advancement of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. If one renounces such activities, it is\nto be understood that he is acting in the mode of darkness.\n\n\n18.8\n\n\ndu\u1e25kham ity eva yat karma\n\n\nk\u0101ya-kle\u015ba-bhay\u0101t tyajet\n\n\nsa k\u1e5btv\u0101 r\u0101jasa\u1e41 ty\u0101ga\u1e41\n\n\nnaiva ty\u0101ga-phala\u1e41 labhet\n\n\ndu\u1e25kham\u2014unhappy; iti\u2014thus; eva\u2014certainly; yat\u2014that which; karma\u2014work; k\u0101ya\u2014body;\nkle\u015ba\u2014troublesome; bhay\u0101t\u2014out of; tyajet\u2014fear; sa\u1e25\u2014that; k\u1e5btv\u0101\u2014after doing;\nr\u0101jasam\u2014in the mode of passion; ty\u0101gam\u2014renunciation; na eva\u2014certainly not;\nty\u0101ga\u2014renounced; phalam\u2014results; labhet\u2014gain.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nAnyone who gives up prescribed duties as troublesome, or out of fear, is said to\nbe in the mode of passion. Such action never leads to the elevation of\nrenunciation.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nOne who is in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness should not give up earning money out of fear\nthat he is performing fruitive activities. If by working one can engage his\nmoney in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, or if by rising early in the morning one can\nadvance his transcendental K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, one should not desist out of\nfear or because such activities are considered troublesome. Such renunciation is\nin the mode of passion. The result of passionate work is always miserable. Even\nif a person renounces work in that spirit, he never gets the result of\nrenunciation.\n\n\n18.9\n\n\nk\u0101ryam ity eva yat karma\n\n\nniyata\u1e41 kriyate \u2019rjuna\n\n\nsa\u1e45ga\u1e41 tyaktv\u0101 phala\u1e41 caiva\n\n\nsa ty\u0101ga\u1e25 s\u0101ttviko mata\u1e25\n\n\nk\u0101ryam\u2014must be done; iti\u2014thus; eva\u2014thus; yat\u2014that which; karma\u2014work;\nniyatam\u2014prescribed; kriyate\u2014performed; arjuna\u2014O Arjuna; sa\u1e45gam\u2014association;\ntyaktv\u0101\u2014giving up; phalam\u2014result; ca\u2014also; eva\u2014certainly; sa\u1e25\u2014that;\nty\u0101ga\u1e25\u2014renunciation; s\u0101ttvika\u1e25\u2014in the mode of goodness; mata\u1e25\u2014in My opinion.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nBut he who performs his prescribed duty only because it ought to be done, and\nrenounces all attachment to the fruit\u2014his renunciation is of the nature of\ngoodness, O Arjuna.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nPrescribed duties must be performed with this mentality. One should act without\nattachment for the result; he should be disassociated from the modes of work. A\nman working in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness in a factory does not associate himself with\nthe work of the factory, nor with the workers of the factory. He simply works\nfor K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. And when he gives up the result for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he is acting\ntranscendentally.\n\n\n18.10\n\n\nna dve\u1e63\u1e6dy aku\u015bala\u1e41 karma\n\n\nku\u015bale n\u0101nu\u1e63ajjate\n\n\nty\u0101g\u012b sattva-sam\u0101vi\u1e63\u1e6do\n\n\nmedh\u0101v\u012b chinna-sa\u1e41\u015baya\u1e25\n\n\nna\u2014never; dve\u1e63\u1e6di\u2014hates; aku\u015balam\u2014inauspicious; karma\u2014work; ku\u015bale\u2014in auspicious;\nna\u2014nor; anu\u1e63ajjate\u2014becomes attached; ty\u0101g\u012b\u2014the renouncer; sattva\u2014goodness;\nsam\u0101vi\u1e63\u1e6da\u1e25\u2014absorbed in; medh\u0101v\u012b\u2014intelligent; chinna\u2014cut up; sa\u1e41\u015baya\u1e25\u2014all doubts.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThose who are situated in the mode of goodness, who neither hate inauspicious\nwork nor are attached to auspicious work, have no doubts about work.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nIt is said in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that one can never give up work at any time.\nTherefore he who works for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and does not enjoy the fruitive results, who\noffers everything to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is actually a renouncer. There are many members of\nthe International Society for Krishna Consciousness who work very hard in their\noffice or in the factory or some other place, and whatever they earn they give\nto the Society. Such highly elevated souls are actually sanny\u0101s\u012bs and are\nsituated in the renounced order of life. It is clearly outlined here how to\nrenounce the fruits of work and for what purpose fruits should be renounced.\n\n\n18.11\n\n\nna hi deha-bh\u1e5bt\u0101 \u015bakya\u1e41\n\n\ntyaktu\u1e41 karm\u0101\u1e47y a\u015be\u1e63ata\u1e25\n\n\nyas tu karma-phala-ty\u0101g\u012b\n\n\nsa ty\u0101g\u012bty abhidh\u012byate\n\n\nna\u2014never; hi\u2014certainly; deha-bh\u1e5bt\u0101\u2014of the embodied; \u015bakyam\u2014possible; tyaktum\u2014to\nrenounce; karm\u0101\u1e47i\u2014activities of; a\u015be\u1e63ata\u1e25\u2014altogether; ya\u1e25 tu\u2014anyone who;\nkarma\u2014work; phala\u2014result; ty\u0101g\u012b\u2014renouncer; sa\u1e25\u2014he; ty\u0101g\u012b\u2014the renouncer;\niti\u2014thus; abhidh\u012byate\u2014it is said.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nIt is indeed impossible for an embodied being to give up all activities.\nTherefore it is said that he who renounces the fruits of action is one who has\ntruly renounced.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nA person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness acting in knowledge of his relationship with\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is always liberated.

These are declared in s\u0101\u1e45khya philosophy to be the\nplace of action, the performer, the senses, the endeavor, and ultimately the\nSupersoul.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nA question may be raised that since any activity performed must have some\nreaction, how is it that the person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness does not suffer or\nenjoy the reactions of work? The Lord is citing Ved\u0101nta philosophy to show how\nthis is possible. He says that there are five causes for all activities and for\nsuccess in all activity, and one should know these five causes. S\u0101\u1e45khya means\nthe stalk of knowledge, and Ved\u0101nta is the final stalk of knowledge accepted by\nall leading \u0101c\u0101ryas. Even \u015aa\u1e45kara accepts Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra as such. Therefore such\nauthority should be consulted.\n\n\nThe ultimate will is invested in the Supersoul, as it is stated in the G\u012bt\u0101,\n\u201csarvasya c\u0101ha\u1e41 h\u1e5bdi.\u201d He is engaging everyone in certain activities. Acts done\nunder His direction from within yield no reaction, either in this life or in the\nlife after death.\n\n\nThe instruments of action are the senses, and by senses the soul acts in various\nways, and for each and every action there is a different endeavor. But all one\u2019s\nactivities depend on the will of the Supersoul, who is seated within the heart\nas a friend. The Supreme Lord is the super cause. Under these circumstances, he\nwho is acting in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness under the direction of the Supersoul\nsituated within the heart is naturally not bound by any activity. Those in\ncomplete K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness are not ultimately responsible for their actions.\nEverything is dependant on the supreme will, the Supersoul, the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead.\n\n\n18.15\n\n\n\u015bar\u012bra-v\u0101\u1e45-manobhir yat\n\n\nkarma pr\u0101rabhate nara\u1e25\n\n\nny\u0101yya\u1e41 v\u0101 vipar\u012bta\u1e41 v\u0101\n\n\npa\u00f1caite tasya hetava\u1e25\n\n\n\u015bar\u012bra\u2014body; v\u0101k\u2014speech; manobhi\u1e25\u2014by the mind; yat\u2014anything; karma\u2014work;\npr\u0101rabhate\u2014begins; nara\u1e25\u2014a person; ny\u0101yyam\u2014right; v\u0101\u2014or; vipar\u012btam\u2014the opposite;\nv\u0101\u2014or; pa\u00f1ca\u2014five; ete\u2014all these; tasya\u2014its; hetava\u1e25\u2014causes.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nWhatever right or wrong action a man performs by body, mind or speech is caused\nby these five factors.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe words \u201cright\u201d and \u201cwrong\u201d are very significant in this verse. Right work is\nwork done in terms of the prescribed directions in the scriptures, and wrong\nwork is work done against the principles of the scriptural injunctions. But\nwhatever is done requires these five factors for its complete performance.\n\n\n18.16\n\n\ntatraiva\u1e41 sati kart\u0101ram\n\n\n\u0101tm\u0101na\u1e41 kevala\u1e41 tu ya\u1e25\n\n\npa\u015byaty ak\u1e5bta-buddhitv\u0101n\n\n\nna sa pa\u015byati durmati\u1e25\n\n\ntatra\u2014there; evam\u2014certainly; sati\u2014being thus; kart\u0101ram\u2014of the worker;\n\u0101tm\u0101nam\u2014the soul; kevalam\u2014only; tu\u2014but; ya\u1e25\u2014anyone; pa\u015byati\u2014sees;\nak\u1e5bta-buddhitv\u0101t\u2014due to unintelligence; na\u2014never; sa\u1e25\u2014he; pa\u015byati\u2014sees;\ndurmati\u1e25\u2014foolish.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nTherefore one who thinks himself the only doer, not considering the five\nfactors, is certainly not very intelligent and cannot see things as they are.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nA foolish person cannot understand that the Supersoul is sitting as a friend\nwithin and conducting his actions. Although the material causes are the place,\nthe worker, the endeavor and the senses, the final cause is the Supreme, the\nPersonality of Godhead. Therefore, one should see not only the four material\ncauses, but the supreme efficient cause as well. One who does not see the\nSupreme thinks himself to be the instrument.\n\n\n18.17\n\n\nyasya n\u0101ha\u1e45k\u1e5bto bh\u0101vo\n\n\nbuddhir yasya na lipyate\n\n\nhatv\u0101pi sa im\u0101l\u0310 lok\u0101n\n\n\nna hanti na nibadhyate\n\n\nyasya\u2014of one who; na\u2014never; aha\u1e45k\u1e5bta\u1e25\u2014false ego; bh\u0101va\u1e25\u2014nature;\nbuddhi\u1e25\u2014intelligence; yasya\u2014one who; na\u2014never; lipyate\u2014is attached; hatv\u0101\napi\u2014even killing; sa\u1e25\u2014he; im\u0101n\u2014this; lok\u0101n\u2014world; na\u2014never; hanti\u2014kills;\nna\u2014never; nibadhyate\u2014becomes entangled.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nOne who is not motivated by false ego, whose intelligence is not entangled,\nthough he kills men in this world, is not the slayer. Nor is he bound by his\nactions.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nIn this verse the Lord informs Arjuna that the desire not to fight arises from\nfalse ego. Arjuna thought himself to be the doer of action, but he did not\nconsider the Supreme sanction within and without. If one does not know that a\nsuper sanction is there, why should he act? But one who knows the instrument of\nwork, himself as the worker, and the Supreme Lord as the supreme sanctioner, is\nperfect in doing everything. Such a person is never in illusion. Personal\nactivity and responsibility arise from false ego and godlessness, or a lack of\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Anyone who is acting in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness under the\ndirection of the Supersoul or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, even though\nkilling, does not kill. Nor is he ever affected with the reaction of such\nkilling. When a soldier kills under the command of a superior officer, he is not\nsubject to be judged. But if a soldier kills on his own personal account, then\nhe is certainly judged by a court of law.\n\n\n18.18\n\n\nj\u00f1\u0101na\u1e41 j\u00f1eya\u1e41 parij\u00f1\u0101t\u0101\n\n\ntri-vidh\u0101 karma-codan\u0101\n\n\nkara\u1e47a\u1e41 karma karteti\n\n\ntri-vidha\u1e25 karma-sa\u1e45graha\u1e25\n\n\nj\u00f1\u0101nam\u2014knowledge; j\u00f1eyam\u2014objective; parij\u00f1\u0101t\u0101\u2014the knower; tri-vidh\u0101\u2014three kinds;\nkarma\u2014work; codan\u0101\u2014impetus; kara\u1e47am\u2014the senses; karma\u2014work; kart\u0101\u2014the doer;\niti\u2014thus; tri-vidha\u1e25\u2014three kinds; karma\u2014work; sa\u1e45graha\u1e25\u2014accumulation.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nKnowledge, the object of knowledge and the knower are the three factors which\nmotivate action; the senses, the work and the doer comprise the threefold basis\nof action.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThere are three kinds of impetus for daily work: knowledge, the object of\nknowledge and the knower. The instruments of work, the work itself and the\nworker are called the constituents of work. Any work done by any human being has\nthese elements. Before one acts, there is some impetus, which is called\ninspiration. Any solution arrived at before work is actualized is a subtle form\nof work. Then work takes the form of action. First one has to undergo the\npsychological processes of thinking, feeling and willing, and that is called\nimpetus. Actually the faith to perform acts is called knowledge. The inspiration\nto work is the same if it comes from the scripture or from the instruction of\nthe spiritual master. When the inspiration is there and the worker is there,\nthen actual activity takes place by the help of the senses. The mind is the\ncenter of all senses, and the object is work itself. These are the different\nphases of work as described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. The sum total of all activities is\ncalled accumulation of work.\n\n\n18.19\n\n\nj\u00f1\u0101na\u1e41 karma ca kart\u0101 ca\n\n\ntridhaiva gu\u1e47a-bhedata\u1e25\n\n\nprocyate gu\u1e47a-sa\u1e45khy\u0101ne\n\n\nyath\u0101vac ch\u1e5b\u1e47u t\u0101ny api\n\n\nj\u00f1\u0101nam\u2014knowledge; karma\u2014work; ca\u2014also; kart\u0101\u2014worker; ca\u2014also; tridh\u0101\u2014three\nkinds; eva\u2014certainly; gu\u1e47a-bhedata\u1e25\u2014in terms of different modes of material\nnature; procyate\u2014is said; gu\u1e47a-sa\u1e45khy\u0101ne\u2014in terms of different modes;\nyath\u0101vat\u2014as they act; \u015b\u1e5b\u1e47u\u2014hear; t\u0101ni\u2014all of them; api\u2014also.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nIn accordance with the three modes of material nature, there are three kinds of\nknowledge, action, and performers of action. Listen as I describe them.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nIn the Fourteenth Chapter the three divisions of the modes of material nature\nwere elaborately described. In that chapter it was said that the mode of\ngoodness is illuminating, the mode of passion materialistic, and the mode of\nignorance conducive to laziness and indolence. All the modes of material nature\nare binding; they are not sources of liberation. Even in the mode of goodness\none is conditioned. In the Seventeenth Chapter, the different types of worship\nby different types of men in different modes of material nature were described.\nIn this verse, the Lord wishes to speak about the different types of knowledge,\nworkers, and work itself according to the three material modes.\n\n\n18.20\n\n\nsarva-bh\u016bte\u1e63u yenaika\u1e41\n\n\nbh\u0101vam avyayam \u012bk\u1e63ate\n\n\navibhakta\u1e41 vibhakte\u1e63u\n\n\ntaj j\u00f1\u0101na\u1e41 viddhi s\u0101ttvikam\n\n\nsarva-bh\u016bte\u1e63u\u2014in all living entities; yena\u2014by whom; ekam\u2014one; bh\u0101vam\u2014situation;\navyayam\u2014imperishable; \u012bk\u1e63ate\u2014does see; avibhaktam\u2014undivided; vibhakte\u1e63u\u2014in the\nnumberless divided; tat\u2014that; j\u00f1\u0101nam\u2014knowledge; viddhi\u2014knows; s\u0101ttvikam\u2014in the\nmode of goodness.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThat knowledge by which one undivided spiritual nature is seen in all\nexistences, undivided in the divided, is knowledge in the mode of goodness.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nA person who sees one spirit soul in every living being, whether a demigod,\nhuman being, animal, bird, beast, aquatic or plant, possesses knowledge in the\nmode of goodness. In all living entities, one spirit soul is there, although\nthey have different bodies in terms of their previous work. As described in the\nSeventh Chapter, the manifestation of the living force in every body is due to\nthe superior nature of the Supreme Lord. Thus to see that one superior nature,\nthat living force, in every body is to see in the mode of goodness. That living\nenergy is imperishable, although the bodies are perishable. The difference is\nperceived in terms of the body because there are many forms of material\nexistence in conditional life; therefore they appear to be divided. Such\nimpersonal knowledge finally leads to self-realization.\n\n\n18.21\n\n\np\u1e5bthaktvena tu yaj j\u00f1\u0101na\u1e41\n\n\nn\u0101n\u0101-bh\u0101v\u0101n p\u1e5bthag-vidh\u0101n\n\n\nvetti sarve\u1e63u bh\u016bte\u1e63u\n\n\ntaj j\u00f1\u0101na\u1e41 viddhi r\u0101jasam\n\n\np\u1e5bthaktvena\u2014because of division; tu\u2014but; yat j\u00f1\u0101nam\u2014which knowledge;\nn\u0101n\u0101-bh\u0101v\u0101n\u2014multifarious situations; p\u1e5bthak-vidh\u0101n\u2014differently; vetti\u2014one who\nknows; sarve\u1e63u\u2014in all; bh\u016bte\u1e63u\u2014living entities; tat j\u00f1\u0101nam\u2014that knowledge;\nviddhi\u2014must be known; r\u0101jasam\u2014in terms of passion.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThat knowledge by which a different type of living entity is seen to be dwelling\nin different bodies is knowledge in the mode of passion.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe concept that the material body is the living entity and that with the\ndestruction of the body the consciousness is also destroyed is called knowledge\nin the mode of passion. According to that knowledge, bodies differ from one\nanother because of the development of different types of consciousness,\notherwise there is no separate soul which manifests consciousness. The body is\nitself the soul, and there is no separate soul beyond this body. According to\nsuch knowledge, consciousness is temporary. Or else there are no individual\nsouls, but there is an all-pervading soul, which is full of knowledge, and this\nbody is a manifestation of temporary ignorance. Or beyond this body there is no\nspecial individual or Supreme Soul. All such conceptions are considered products\nof the mode of passion.\n\n\n18.22\n\n\nyat tu k\u1e5btsna-vad ekasmin\n\n\nk\u0101rye saktam ahaitukam\n\n\natattv\u0101rtha-vad alpa\u1e41 ca\n\n\ntat t\u0101masam ud\u0101h\u1e5btam\n\n\nyat\u2014that which; tu\u2014but; k\u1e5btsnavat\u2014all in all; ekasmin\u2014in one; k\u0101rye\u2014work;\nsaktam\u2014attached; ahaitukam\u2014without cause; atattva-arthavat\u2014without reality;\nalpam ca\u2014and very meager; tat\u2014that; t\u0101masam\u2014in the mode of darkness; ud\u0101h\u1e5btam\u2014is\nspoken.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nAnd that knowledge by which one is attached to one kind of work as the all in\nall, without knowledge of the truth, and which is very meager, is said to be in\nthe mode of darkness.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe \u201cknowledge\u201d of the common man is always in the mode of darkness or ignorance\nbecause every living entity in conditional life is born into the mode of\nignorance. One who does not develop knowledge through the authorities or\nscriptural injunctions has knowledge that is limited to the body.

That which in the beginning may be just like poison but\nat the end is just like nectar and which awakens one to self-realization is said\nto be happiness in the mode of goodness.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nA conditioned soul tries to enjoy material happiness again and again. Thus he\nchews the chewed, but, sometimes, in the course of such enjoyment, he becomes\nrelieved from material entanglement by association with a great soul. In other\nwords, a conditioned soul is always engaged in some type of sense gratification,\nbut when he understands by good association that it is only a repetition of the\nsame thing, and he is awakened to his real K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, he is sometimes\nrelieved from such repetitive so-called happiness.\n\n\nIn the pursuit of self-realization, one has to follow many rules and regulations\nto control the mind and the senses and to concentrate the mind on the Self. All\nthese procedures are very difficult, bitter like poison, but if one is\nsuccessful in following the regulations and comes to the transcendental\nposition, he begins to drink real nectar, and he enjoys life.\n\n\n18.38\n\n\nvi\u1e63ayendriya-sa\u1e41yog\u0101d\n\n\nyat tad agre \u2019m\u1e5btopamam\n\n\npari\u1e47\u0101me vi\u1e63am iva\n\n\ntat sukha\u1e41 r\u0101jasa\u1e41 sm\u1e5btam\n\n\nvi\u1e63aya\u2014objects of sense; indriya\u2014senses; sa\u1e41yog\u0101t\u2014combination; yat\u2014that;\ntat\u2014which; agre\u2014in the beginning; am\u1e5bta-upamam\u2014just like nectar; pari\u1e47\u0101me\u2014at the\nend; vi\u1e63am iva\u2014like poison; tat\u2014that; sukham\u2014happiness; r\u0101jasam\u2014in the mode of\npassion; sm\u1e5btam\u2014is considered.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThat happiness which is derived from contact of the senses with their objects\nand which appears like nectar at first but poison at the end is said to be of\nthe nature of passion.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nA young man and a young woman meet, and the senses drive the young man to see\nher, to touch her and to have sexual intercourse. In the beginning this may be\nvery pleasing to the senses, but at the end, or after some time, it becomes just\nlike poison. They are separated or there is divorce, there is lamentation, there\nis sorrow, etc. Such happiness is always in the mode of passion.

As such, the Supreme Lord is the beginning of all\nliving entities. This is confirmed in the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra\u2014janm\u0101dy asya yata\u1e25. The\nSupreme Lord is therefore the beginning of life of every living entity. And the\nSupreme Lord, by His two energies, His external energy and internal energy, is\nall-pervading. Therefore one should worship the Supreme Lord with His energies.\nGenerally the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava devotees worship the Supreme Lord with His internal\nenergy. His external energy is a perverted reflection of the internal energy.\nThe external energy is a background, but the Supreme Lord by the expansion of\nHis plenary portion as Param\u0101tm\u0101 is situated everywhere. He is the Supersoul of\nall demigods, all human beings, all animals, everywhere. One should therefore\nknow that as part and parcel of the Supreme Lord it is his duty to render\nservice unto the Supreme. Everyone should be engaged in devotional service to\nthe Lord in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. That is recommended in this verse.\n\n\nEveryone should think that he is engaged in a particular type of occupation by\nH\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba, the master of the senses. And, by the result of the work in which one\nis engaged, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, should be worshiped.\nIf one thinks always in this way, in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, then, by the\ngrace of the Lord, he becomes fully aware of everything. That is the perfection\nof life. The Lord says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, te\u1e63\u0101m aha\u1e41 samuddhart\u0101. The Supreme\nLord Himself takes charge of delivering such a devotee. That is the highest\nperfection of life. In whatever occupation one may be engaged, if he serves the\nSupreme Lord, he will achieve the highest perfection.\n\n\n18.47\n\n\n\u015brey\u0101n sva-dharmo vigu\u1e47a\u1e25\n\n\npara-dharm\u0101t sv-anu\u1e63\u1e6dhit\u0101t\n\n\nsvabh\u0101va-niyata\u1e41 karma\n\n\nkurvan n\u0101pnoti kilbi\u1e63am\n\n\nsrey\u0101n\u2014better; sva-dharma\u1e25\u2014one\u2019s own occupation; vigu\u1e47a\u1e25\u2014imperfectly performed;\npara-dharm\u0101t\u2014another\u2019s occupation; svanu\u1e63\u1e6dhit\u0101t\u2014perfectly done;\nsvabh\u0101va-niyatam\u2014prescribed duties according to one\u2019s nature; karma\u2014work;\nkurvan\u2014performing; na\u2014never; \u0101pnoti\u2014achieve; kilbi\u1e63am\u2014sinful reactions.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nIt is better to engage in one\u2019s own occupation, even though one may perform it\nimperfectly, than to accept another\u2019s occupation and perform it perfectly.\nPrescribed duties, according to one\u2019s nature, are never affected by sinful\nreactions.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nOne\u2019s occupational duty is prescribed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. As already discussed in\nprevious verses, the duties of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, k\u1e63atriya, vai\u015bya and \u015b\u016bdra are\nprescribed according to the particular modes of nature. One should not imitate\nanother\u2019s duty. Aman who is by nature attracted to the kind of work done by\n\u015b\u016bdras should not artificially claim himself to be a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, although he may\nbe born into a br\u0101hma\u1e47a family. In this way one should work according to his own\nnature; no work is abominable, if performed in the service of the Supreme Lord.\nThe occupational duty of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a is certainly in the mode of goodness, but if\na person is not by nature in the mode of goodness, he should not imitate the\noccupational duty of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a. For a k\u1e63atriya, or administrator, there are so\nmany abominable things; a k\u1e63atriya has to be violent to kill his enemies, and\nsometimes a k\u1e63atriya has to tell lies for the sake of diplomacy. Such violence\nand duplicity accompany political affairs, but a k\u1e63atriya is not supposed to\ngive up his occupational duty and try to perform the duties of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a.\n\n\nOne should act to satisfy the Supreme Lord. For example, Arjuna was a k\u1e63atriya.\nHe was hesitating to fight the other party. But if such fighting is performed\nfor the sake of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, there need be no fear\nof degradation. In the business field also, sometimes a merchant has to tell so\nmany lies to make a profit. If he does not do so, there can be no profit.\nSometimes a merchant says, \u201cOh, my dear customer, for you I am making no\nprofit,\u201d but one should know that without profit the merchant cannot exist.\nTherefore it should be taken as a simple lie if a merchant says that he is not\nmaking a profit. But the merchant should not think that because he is engaged in\nan occupation in which the telling of lies is compulsory, he should give up his\nprofession and pursue the profession of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a. That is not recommended.\nWhether one is a k\u1e63atriya, a vai\u015bya, or a \u015b\u016bdra doesn\u2019t matter, if he serves, by\nhis work, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Even br\u0101hma\u1e47as, who perform\ndifferent types of sacrifice, sometimes must kill animals because sometimes\nanimals are sacrificed in such ceremonies. Similarly, if a k\u1e63atriya engaged in\nhis own occupation kills an enemy, there is no sin incurred. In the Third\nChapter these matters have been clearly and elaborately explained; every man\nshould work for the purpose of yaj\u00f1a, or for Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead. Anything done for personal sense gratification is a cause of bondage.\nThe conclusion is that everyone should be engaged according to the particular\nmode of nature he has acquired, and he should decide to work only to serve the\nsupreme cause of the Supreme Lord.\n\n\n18.48\n\n\nsaha-ja\u1e41 karma kaunteya\n\n\nsa-do\u1e63am api na tyajet\n\n\nsarv\u0101rambh\u0101 hi do\u1e63e\u1e47a\n\n\ndh\u016bmen\u0101gnir iv\u0101v\u1e5bt\u0101\u1e25\n\n\nsaha-jam\u2014born simultaneously; karma\u2014work; kaunteya\u2014O son of Kunt\u012b; sa-do\u1e63am\u2014with\nfault; api\u2014although; na\u2014never; tyajet\u2014to be given up; sarva-\u0101rambh\u0101\u1e25\u2014any\nventure; hi\u2014is certainly; do\u1e63e\u1e47a\u2014with fault; dh\u016bmena\u2014with smoke; agni\u1e25\u2014fire;\niva\u2014as; \u0101v\u1e5bt\u0101\u1e25\u2014covered.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nEvery endeavor is covered by some sort of fault, just as fire is covered by\nsmoke. Therefore one should not give up the work which is born of his nature, O\nson of Kunt\u012b, even if such work is full of fault.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nIn conditioned life, all work is contaminated by the material modes of nature.\nEven if one is a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, he has to perform sacrifices in which animal killing\nis necessary. Similarly, a k\u1e63atriya, however pious he may be, has to fight\nenemies. He cannot avoid it. Similarly, a merchant, however pious he may be,\nmust sometimes hide his profit to stay in business, or he may sometimes have to\ndo business on the black market. These things are necessary; one cannot avoid\nthem. Similarly, even though a man is a \u015b\u016bdra serving a bad master, he has to\ncarry out the order of the master, even though it should not be done. Despite\nthese flaws, one should continue to carry out his prescribed duties, for they\nare born out of his own nature.\n\n\nA very nice example is given herein. Although fire is pure, still there is\nsmoke. Yet smoke does not make the fire impure. Even though there is smoke in\nthe fire, fire is still considered to be the purest of all elements. If one\nprefers to give up the work of a k\u1e63atriya and take up the occupation of a\nbr\u0101hma\u1e47a, he is not assured that in the occupation of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a there are no\nunpleasant duties. One may then conclude that in the material world no one can\nbe completely free from the contamination of material nature. This example of\nfire and smoke is very appropriate in this connection. When in wintertime one\ntakes a stone from the fire, sometimes smoke disturbs the eyes and other parts\nof the body, but still one must make use of the fire despite disturbing\nconditions. Similarly, one should not give up his natural occupation because\nthere are some disturbing elements. Rather, one should be determined to serve\nthe Supreme Lord by his occupational duty in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. That is the\nperfectional point. When a particular type of occupation is performed for the\nsatisfaction of the Supreme Lord, all the defects in that particular occupation\nare purified. When the results of work are purified, when connected with\ndevotional service, one becomes perfect in seeing the self within, and that is\nself-realization.\n\n\n18.49\n\n\nasakta-buddhi\u1e25 sarvatra\n\n\njit\u0101tm\u0101 vigata-sp\u1e5bha\u1e25\n\n\nnai\u1e63karmya-siddhi\u1e41 param\u0101\u1e41\n\n\nsanny\u0101sen\u0101dhigacchati\n\n\nasakta-buddhi\u1e25\u2014unattached intelligence; sarvatra\u2014everywhere; jita-\u0101tm\u0101\u2014control\nof the mind, vigata-sp\u1e5bha\u1e25\u2014without material desires;\nnai\u1e63karmya-siddhim\u2014perfection of non-reaction; param\u0101m\u2014supreme; sanny\u0101sena\u2014by\nthe renounced order of life; adhigacchati\u2014attains.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nOne can obtain the results of renunciation simply by self-control and by\nbecoming unattached to material things and disregarding material enjoyments.\nThat is the highest perfectional stage of renunciation.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nReal renunciation means that one should always think himself part and parcel of\nthe Supreme Lord. Therefore he has no right to enjoy the results of his work.\nSince he is part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, the results of his work must be\nenjoyed by the Supreme Lord. This is actually Kr\u1e63na consciousness. The person\nacting in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is really a sanny\u0101s\u012b, one in the renounced order\nof life. By such mentality, one is satisfied because he is actually acting for\nthe Supreme. Thus he is not attached to anything material; he becomes accustomed\nto not taking pleasure in anything beyond the transcendental happiness derived\nfrom the service of the Lord. A sanny\u0101s\u012b is supposed to be free from the\nreactions of his past activities, but a person who is in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness\nautomatically attains this perfection without even accepting the so-called order\nof renunciation. This state of mind is called yog\u0101r\u016b\u1e0dha, or the perfectional\nstage of yoga, as confirmed in the Third Chapter: yas tv \u0101tma-ratir eva sy\u0101t.\nOne who is satisfied in himself has no fear of any kind of reaction from his\nactivity.\n\n\n18.50\n\n\nsiddhi\u1e41 pr\u0101pto yath\u0101 brahma\n\n\ntath\u0101pnoti nibodha me\n\n\nsam\u0101senaiva kaunteya\n\n\nni\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101 j\u00f1\u0101nasya y\u0101 par\u0101\n\n\nsiddhim\u2014perfection; pr\u0101pta\u1e25\u2014achieving; yath\u0101\u2014as; brahma\u2014the Supreme; tath\u0101\u2014so;\n\u0101pnoti\u2014achieves; nibodha\u2014try to understand; me\u2014from Me; sam\u0101sena\u2014summarily;\neva\u2014certainly; kaunteya\u2014O son of Kunt\u012b; ni\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101\u2014stage; j\u00f1\u0101nasya\u2014of knowledge;\ny\u0101\u2014which; par\u0101\u2014transcendental.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nO son of Kunt\u012b, learn from Me in brief how one can attain to the supreme\nperfectional stage, Brahman, by acting in the way which I shall now summarize.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe Lord describes for Arjuna how one can achieve the highest perfectional stage\nsimply by being engaged in his occupational duty, performing that duty for the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead. One attains the supreme stage of Brahman simply\nby renouncing the result of his work for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord.\nThat is the process of self-realization. Actual perfection of knowledge is in\nattaining pure K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness; that is described in the following verses.\n\n\n18.51-53\n\n\nbuddhy\u0101 vi\u015buddhay\u0101 yukto\n\n\ndh\u1e5bty\u0101tm\u0101na\u1e41 niyamya ca\n\n\n\u015babd\u0101d\u012bn vi\u1e63ay\u0101\u1e41s tyaktv\u0101\n\n\nr\u0101ga-dve\u1e63au vyudasya ca\n\n\nvivikta-sev\u012b laghv-\u0101\u015b\u012b\n\n\nyata-v\u0101k-k\u0101ya-m\u0101nasa\u1e25\n\n\ndhy\u0101na-yoga-paro nitya\u1e41\n\n\nvair\u0101gya\u1e41 samup\u0101\u015brita\u1e25\n\n\naha\u1e45k\u0101ra\u1e41 bala\u1e41 darpa\u1e41\n\n\nk\u0101ma\u1e41 krodha\u1e41 parigraham\n\n\nvimucya nirmama\u1e25 \u015b\u0101nto\n\n\nbrahma-bh\u016by\u0101ya kalpate\n\n\nbuddhy\u0101\u2014by the intelligence; vi\u015buddhay\u0101\u2014fully purified; yukta\u1e25\u2014such engagement;\ndh\u1e5bty\u0101\u2014determination; \u0101tm\u0101nam\u2014self; niyamya\u2014regulated; ca\u2014also; \u015babd\u0101d\u012bn\u2014the\nsense objects, such as sound, etc.; vi\u1e63ay\u0101n\u2014sense objects; tyaktv\u0101\u2014giving up;\nr\u0101ga\u2014attachments; dve\u1e63au\u2014hatred; vyudasya\u2014having laid aside; ca\u2014also;\nvivikta-sev\u012b\u2014living in a secluded place; laghu-\u0101\u015b\u012b\u2014eating a small quantity;\nyata-v\u0101k\u2014control of speech; k\u0101ya\u2014body; m\u0101nasa\u1e25\u2014control of the mind;\ndhy\u0101na-yoga-para\u1e25\u2014always absorbed in trance; nityam\u2014twenty-four hours a day;\nvair\u0101gyam\u2014detachment; samup\u0101\u015brita\u1e25\u2014taken shelter of; aha\u1e45k\u0101ram\u2014false ego;\nbalam\u2014false strength; darpam\u2014false pride; k\u0101mam\u2014lust; krodham\u2014anger;\nparigraham\u2014acceptance of material things; vimucya\u2014being delivered;\nnirmama\u1e25\u2014without proprietorship; \u015b\u0101nta\u1e25\u2014peaceful; brahma-bh\u016by\u0101ya\u2014to become\nself-realized; kalpate\u2014is understood.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nBeing purified by his intelligence and controlling the mind with determination,\ngiving up the objects of sense gratification, being freed from attachment and\nhatred, one who lives in a secluded place, who eats little and who controls the\nbody and the tongue, and is always in trance and is detached, who is without\nfalse ego, false strength, false pride, lust, anger, and who does not accept\nmaterial things, such a person is certainly elevated to the position of\nself-realization.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nWhen one is purified by knowledge, he keeps himself in the mode of goodness.\nThus one becomes the controller of the mind and is always in trance. Because he\nis not attached to the objects of sense gratification, he does not eat more than\nwhat he requires, and he controls the activities of his body and mind. He has no\nfalse ego because he does not accept the body as himself. Nor has he a desire to\nmake the body fat and strong by accepting so many material things. Because he\nhas no bodily concept of life, he is not falsely proud. He is satisfied with\neverything that is offered to him by the grace of the Lord, and he is never\nangry in the absence of sense gratification. Nor does he endeavor to acquire\nsense objects. Thus when he is completely free from false ego, he becomes\nnonattached to all material things, and that is the stage of self-realization of\nBrahman. That stage is called the brahma-bh\u016bta stage. When one is free from the\nmaterial conception of life, he becomes peaceful and cannot be agitated.\n\n\n18.54\n\n\nbrahma-bh\u016bta\u1e25 prasann\u0101tm\u0101\n\n\nna \u015bocati na k\u0101\u1e45k\u1e63ati\n\n\nsama\u1e25 sarve\u1e63u bh\u016bte\u1e63u\n\n\nmad-bhakti\u1e41 labhate par\u0101m\n\n\nbrahma-bh\u016bta\u1e25\u2014being one with the Absolute; prasanna-\u0101tm\u0101\u2014fully joyful; na\u2014never;\n\u015bocati\u2014laments; na\u2014never; k\u0101\u1e45k\u1e63ati\u2014desires; sama\u1e25\u2014equally disposed; sarve\u1e63u\u2014all;\nbh\u016bte\u1e63u\u2014living entity; mat-bhaktim\u2014My devotional service; labhate\u2014gains;\npar\u0101m\u2014transcendental.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nOne who is thus transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme Brahman.\nHe never laments nor desires to have anything; he is equally disposed to every\nliving entity. In that state he attains pure devotional service unto Me.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nTo the impersonalist, achieving the brahma-bh\u016bta stage, becoming one with the\nAbsolute, is the last word. But for the personalist, or pure devotee, one has to\ngo still further to become engaged in pure devotional service. This means that\none who is engaged in pure devotional service to the Supreme Lord is already in\na state of liberation, called brahma-bh\u016bta, oneness with the Absolute. Without\nbeing one with the Supreme, the Absolute, one cannot render service unto Him. In\nthe absolute conception, there is no difference between the served and the\nservitor; yet the distinction is there, in a higher spiritual sense.\n\n\nIn the material concept of life, when one works for sense gratification, there\nis misery, but in the absolute world, when one is engaged in pure devotional\nservice, there is no misery. The devotee in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness has nothing to\nlament or desire. Since God is full, a living entity who is engaged in God\u2019s\nservice, in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, becomes also full in himself. He is just like a\nriver cleansed of all dirty water. Because a pure devotee has no thought other\nthan K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he is naturally always joyful. He does not lament for any material\nloss or gain because he is full in service of the Lord. He has no desire for\nmaterial enjoyment because he knows that every living entity is the fragmental\npart and parcel of the Supreme Lord and therefore eternally a servant. He does\nnot see, in the material world, someone as higher and someone as lower; higher\nand lower positions are ephemeral, and a devotee has nothing to do with\nephemeral appearances or disappearances. For him stone and gold are of equal\nvalue. This is the brahma-bh\u016bta stage, and this stage is attained very easily by\nthe pure devotee. In that stage of existence, the idea of becoming one with the\nSupreme Brahman and annihilating one\u2019s individuality becomes hellish, and the\nidea of attaining the heavenly kingdom becomes phantasmagoria, and the senses\nare like broken serpents\u2019 teeth. As there is no fear of a serpent with broken\nteeth, so there is no fear from the senses when they are automatically\ncontrolled. The world is miserable for the materially infected person, but for a\ndevotee the entire world is as good as Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha, or the spiritual sky. The\nhighest personality in this material universe is no more significant than an ant\nfor a devotee. Such a stage can be achieved by the mercy of Lord Caitanya, who\npreached pure devotional service in this age.\n\n\n18.55\n\n\nbhakty\u0101 m\u0101m abhij\u0101n\u0101ti\n\n\ny\u0101v\u0101n ya\u015b c\u0101smi tattvata\u1e25\n\n\ntato m\u0101\u1e41 tattvato j\u00f1\u0101tv\u0101\n\n\nvi\u015bate tad-anantaram\n\n\nbhakty\u0101\u2014by pure devotional service; m\u0101m\u2014Me; abhij\u0101n\u0101ti\u2014one can know; y\u0101v\u0101n\u2014as\nmuch as; ya\u1e25 ca asmi\u2014as I am; tattvata\u1e25\u2014in truth; tata\u1e25\u2014thereafter; m\u0101m\u2014Me;\ntattvata\u1e25\u2014by truth; j\u00f1\u0101tv\u0101\u2014knowing; vi\u015bate\u2014enters; tat\u2014thereafter;\nanantaram\u2014after\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nOne can understand the Supreme Personality as He is only by devotional service.\nAnd when one is in full consciousness of the Supreme Lord by such devotion, he\ncan enter into the kingdom of God.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and His plenary portions cannot be\nunderstood by mental speculation nor by the nondevotees. If anyone wants to\nunderstand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he has to take to pure devotional\nservice under the guidance of a pure devotee. Otherwise, the truth of the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead will always be hidden. It is already stated\n(n\u0101ha\u1e41 prak\u0101\u015ba\u1e25) that He is not revealed to everyone. Everyone cannot understand\nGod simply by erudite scholarship or mental speculation. Only one who is\nactually engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and devotional service can understand\nwhat K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is. University degrees are not helpful.\n\n\nOne who is fully conversant with the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a science becomes eligible to enter\ninto the spiritual kingdom, the abode of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Becoming Brahman does not mean\nthat one loses his identity. Devotional service is there, and as long as\ndevotional service exists, there must be God, the devotee, and the process of\ndevotional service. Such knowledge is never vanquished, even after liberation.\nLiberation involves getting free from the concept of material life; in spiritual\nlife the same distinction is there, the same individuality is there, but in pure\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. One should not misunderstand that the word vi\u015bate, \u201centers\ninto Me,\u201d supports the monist theory that one becomes homogeneous with the\nimpersonal Brahman. No. Vi\u015bate means that one can enter into the abode of the\nSupreme Lord in his individuality to engage in His association and render\nservice unto Him. For instance, a green bird enters a green tree not to become\none with the tree but to enjoy the fruits of the tree. Impersonalists generally\ngive the example of a river flowing into the ocean and merging. This may be a\nsource of happiness for the impersonalist, but the personalist keeps his\npersonal individuality like an aquatic in the ocean. We find so many living\nentities within the ocean, if we go deep. Surface acquaintance with the ocean is\nnot sufficient; one must have complete knowledge of the aquatics living in the\nocean depths.\n\n\nBecause of his pure devotional service, a devotee can understand the\ntranscendental qualities and the opulences of the Supreme Lord in truth. As it\nis stated in the Eleventh Chapter, only by devotional service can one\nunderstand. The same is confirmed here; one can understand the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead by devotional service and enter into His kingdom.\n\n\nAfter attainment of the brahma-bh\u016bta stage of freedom from material conceptions,\ndevotional service begins by one\u2019s hearing about the Lord. When one hears about\nthe Supreme Lord, automatically the brahma-bh\u016bta stage develops, and material\ncontamination\u2014greediness and lust for sense enjoyment\u2014disappears. As lust and\ndesires disappear from the heart of a devotee, he becomes more attached to the\nservice of the Lord, and by such attachment he becomes free from material\ncontamination. In that state of life he can understand the Supreme Lord. This is\nthe statement of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam also. Also after liberation the process of\nbhakti or transcendental service continues. The Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra confirms this:\n\u0101pr\u0101ya\u1e47\u0101t tatr\u0101pi hi d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dam. This means that after liberation the process of\ndevotional service continues. In the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, real devotional\nliberation is defined as the reinstatement of the living entity in his own\nidentity, his own constitutional position. The constitutional position is\nalready explained: every living entity is the part and parcel fragmental portion\nof the Supreme Lord. Therefore his constitutional position is to serve. After\nliberation, this service is never stopped. Actual liberation is getting free\nfrom misconceptions of life.\n\n\n18.56\n\n\nsarva-karm\u0101\u1e47y api sad\u0101\n\n\nkurv\u0101\u1e47o mad-vyap\u0101\u015braya\u1e25\n\n\nmat-pras\u0101d\u0101d av\u0101pnoti\n\n\n\u015b\u0101\u015bvata\u1e41 padam avyayam\n\n\nsarva\u2014all; karm\u0101\u1e47i\u2014activities; api\u2014although; sad\u0101\u2014always; kurv\u0101\u1e47a\u1e25\u2014performing;\nmat\u2014under My; vyap\u0101\u015brayah\u2014protection; mat\u2014My; pras\u0101d\u0101t\u2014mercy; av\u0101pnoti\u2014achieves;\ns\u0101\u015bvatam\u2014eternal; padam\u2014abode; avyayam\u2014-imperishable.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThough engaged in all kinds of activities, My devotee, under My protection,\nreaches the eternal and imperishable abode by My grace.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe word mad-vyap\u0101\u015braya\u1e25 means under the protection of the Supreme Lord.

In\nsuch devotional service, be fully conscious of Me.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nWhen one acts in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, he does not act as the master of the\nworld. Just like a servant, one should act fully under the direction of the\nSupreme Lord. A servant has no individual independence. He acts only on the\norder of the master. A servant acting on behalf of the supreme master has no\naffection for profit and loss. He simply discharges his duty faithfully in terms\nof the order of the Lord. Now, one may argue that Arjuna was acting under the\npersonal direction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but, when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not present, how should one act?\nIf one acts according to the direction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in this book, as well as under\nthe guidance of the representative of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, then the result will be the same.\nThe Sanskrit word mat-para\u1e25 is very important in this verse. It indicates that\none has no goal in life save and except acting in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness just to\nsatisfy K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. And, while working in that way, one should think of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a only:\n\u201cI have been appointed to discharge this particular duty by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u201d While acting\nin such a way, one naturally has to think of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This is perfect K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness. One should, however, note that, after doing something\nwhimsically, he should not offer the result to the Supreme Lord. That sort of\nduty is not in the devotional service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. One should act\naccording to the order of Kr\u1e63na. This is a very important point. That order of\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a comes through disciplic succession from the bona fide spiritual master.\nTherefore the spiritual master\u2019s order should be taken as the prime duty of\nlife. If one gets a bona fide spiritual master and acts according to his\ndirection, then his perfection of life in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is guaranteed.\n\n\n18.58\n\n\nmac-citta\u1e25 sarva-durg\u0101\u1e47i\n\n\nmat-pras\u0101d\u0101t tari\u1e63yasi\n\n\natha cet tvam aha\u1e45k\u0101r\u0101n\n\n\nna \u015bro\u1e63yasi vina\u1e45k\u1e63yasi\n\n\nmat\u2014My; citta\u1e25\u2014consciousness; sarva\u2014all; durg\u0101\u1e47i\u2014impediments; mat\u2014My;\npras\u0101d\u0101t\u2014My mercy; tari\u1e63yasi\u2014you will overcome; atha\u2014therefore; cet\u2014if;\ntvam\u2014you; aha\u1e45k\u0101r\u0101t\u2014by false ego; na\u2014not; \u015bro\u1e63yasi\u2014do not hear; vina\u1e45k\u1e63yasi\u2014then\nlose yourself.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nIf you become conscious of Me, you will pass over all the obstacles of\nconditional life by My grace. If, however, you do not work in such consciousness\nbut act through false ego, not hearing Me, you will be lost.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nA person in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is not unduly anxious to execute the duties\nof his existence. The foolish cannot understand this great freedom from all\nanxiety. For one who acts in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a becomes the most\nintimate friend. He always looks after His friend\u2019s comfort, and He gives\nHimself to His friend, who is so devotedly engaged working twenty-four hours a\nday to please the Lord. Therefore, no one should be carried away by the false\nego of the bodily concept of life. One should not falsely think himself\nindependant of the laws of material nature or free to act. He is already under\nstrict material laws. But, as soon as he acts in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, he is\nliberated, free from the material perplexities. One should note very carefully\nthat one who is not active in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is losing himself in the\nmaterial whirlpool, in the ocean of birth and death. No conditioned soul\nactually knows what is to be done and what is not to be done, but a person who\nacts in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is free to act because everything is prompted by\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a from within and confirmed by the spiritual master.\n\n\n18.59\n\n\nyad aha\u1e45k\u0101ram \u0101\u015britya\n\n\nna yotsya iti manyase\n\n\nmithyai\u1e63a vyavas\u0101yas te\n\n\nprak\u1e5btis tv\u0101\u1e41 niyok\u1e63yati\n\n\nyat\u2014therefore; aha\u1e45k\u0101ram\u2014false ego; \u0101\u015britya\u2014taking shelter; na\u2014not; yotsya\u2014shall\nfight; iti\u2014thus; manyase\u2014think; mithy\u0101 e\u1e63a\u1e25\u2014this is all false; vyavas\u0101yah\nte\u2014your determination; prak\u1e5bti\u1e25\u2014material nature; tv\u0101m\u2014you; niyok\u1e63yati\u2014will\nengage you.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nIf you do not act according to My direction and do not fight, then you will be\nfalsely directed.

But, due to false ego, he was fearing that by killing\nhis teacher, grandfather and friends, there would be sinful reactions. Actually\nhe was considering himself master of his actions, as if he were directing the\ngood and bad results of such work. He forgot that the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead was present there, instructing him to fight. That is the forgetfulness\nof the conditioned soul. The Supreme Personality gives directions as to what is\ngood and what is bad, and one simply has to act in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness to attain\nthe perfection of life. No one can ascertain his destiny as the Supreme Lord\ncan; therefore the best course is to take direction from the Supreme Lord and\nact. No one should neglect the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead or\nthe order of the spiritual master who is the representative of God. One should\nact unhesitatingly to execute the order of the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead\u2014that will keep him safe under all circumstances.\n\n\n18.60\n\n\nsvabh\u0101va-jena kaunteya\n\n\nnibaddha\u1e25 svena karma\u1e47\u0101\n\n\nkartu\u1e41 necchasi yan moh\u0101t\n\n\nkari\u1e63yasy ava\u015bo \u2019pi tat\n\n\nsva-bh\u0101va-jena\u2014by one\u2019s own nature; kaunteya\u2014O son of Kunt\u012b;\nnibaddha\u1e25\u2014conditioned; svena\u2014by one\u2019s own; karma\u1e47\u0101\u2014activities; kartum\u2014to do;\nna\u2014not; icchasi\u2014like; yat\u2014that; moh\u0101t\u2014by illusion; kari\u1e63yasi\u2014you will act;\nava\u015ba\u1e25\u2014imperceptibly; api\u2014even; tat\u2014that.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nUnder illusion you are now declining to act according to My direction.

Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a instructed that the individual is\nnot all in all. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, or He Himself, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the\nlocalized Supersoul, sits in the heart directing the living being. After\nchanging bodies, the living entity forgets his past deeds, but the Supersoul, as\nthe knower of the past, present and future, remains the witness of all his\nactivities. Therefore all the activities of living entities are directed by this\nSupersoul. The living entity gets what he deserves and is carried by the\nmaterial body which is created in the material energy under the direction of the\nSupersoul. As soon as a living entity is placed in a particular type of body, he\nhas to work under the spell of that bodily situation. A person seated in a\nhigh-speed motor car goes faster than one seated in a slower car, though the\nliving entities, the drivers, may be the same. Similarly, by the order of the\nSupreme Soul, material nature fashions a particular type of body to a particular\ntype of living entity to work according to his past desires. The living entity\nis not independant. One should not think himself independant of the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead. The individual is always under His control. Therefore\nhis duty is to surrender, and that is the injunction of the next verse.\n\n\n18.62\n\n\ntam eva \u015bara\u1e47a\u1e41 gaccha\n\n\nsarva-bh\u0101vena bh\u0101rata\n\n\ntat-pras\u0101d\u0101t par\u0101\u1e41 \u015b\u0101nti\u1e41\n\n\nsth\u0101na\u1e41 pr\u0101psyasi \u015b\u0101\u015bvatam\n\n\ntam\u2014unto Him; eva\u2014certainly; \u015bara\u1e47am\u2014surrender; gaccha\u2014go; sarva-bh\u0101vena\u2014in all\nrespects; bh\u0101rata\u2014O son of Bharata; tat-pras\u0101d\u0101t\u2014by His grace;\npar\u0101m\u2014transcendental; \u015b\u0101ntim\u2014peace; sth\u0101nam\u2014abode; pr\u0101psyasi\u2014you will get;\n\u015b\u0101\u015bvatam\u2014eternal.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nO scion of Bharata, surrender unto Him utterly.

By such surrender, one will not\nonly be released from all miseries in this life, but at the end he will reach\nthe Supreme God. The transcendental world is described in the Vedic literature\nas tad vi\u1e63\u1e47o\u1e25 parama\u1e41 padam. Since all of creation is the kingdom of God,\neverything material is actually spiritual, but parama\u1e41 padam specifically refers\nto the eternal abode, which is called the spiritual sky or Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha.\n\n\nIn the Fifteenth Chapter of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 it is stated: \u201cSarvasya c\u0101ham h\u1e5bdi\nsannivi\u1e63\u1e6da\u1e25.\u201d The Lord is seated in everyone\u2019s heart, so this recommendation\nthat one should surrender unto the Supersoul sitting within means that one\nshould surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has\nalready been accepted by Arjuna as the Supreme. He was accepted in the Tenth\nChapter as para\u1e41 brahma para\u1e41 dh\u0101ma. Arjuna has accepted K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead and the supreme abode of all living entities, not only\nbecause of his personal experience but also because of the evidences of great\nauthorities like N\u0101rada, Asita, Devala and Vy\u0101sa.\n\n\n18.63\n\n\niti te j\u00f1\u0101nam \u0101khy\u0101ta\u1e41\n\n\nguhy\u0101d guhyatara\u1e41 may\u0101\n\n\nvim\u1e5b\u015byaitad a\u015be\u1e63e\u1e47a\n\n\nyathecchasi tath\u0101 kuru\n\n\niti\u2014thus; te\u2014unto you; j\u00f1\u0101nam\u2014knowledge; \u0101khy\u0101tam\u2014described;\nguhy\u0101t\u2014confidential; guhyataram\u2014still more confidential; may\u0101\u2014by Me; vim\u1e5b\u015bya\u2014by\ndeliberation; etat\u2014that; a\u015be\u1e63e\u1e47a\u2014fully; yath\u0101\u2014as you; icchasi\u2014you like;\ntath\u0101\u2014that; kuru\u2014perform.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nThus I have explained to you the most confidential of all knowledge. Deliberate\non this fully, and then do what you wish to do.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe Lord has already explained to Arjuna the knowledge of brahmabh\u016bta. One who\nis in the brahma-bh\u016bta condition is joyful; he never laments, nor does he desire\nanything. That is due to confidential knowledge. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a also discloses knowledge\nof the Supersoul. This is also Brahman knowledge, knowledge of Brahman, but it\nis superior.\n\n\nHere Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a telIs Arjuna that he can do as he chooses. God does not\ninterfere with the little independence of the living entity. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101,\nthe Lord has explained in all respects how one can elevate his living condition.\nThe best advice imparted to Arjuna is to surrender unto the Supersoul seated\nwithin his heart. By right discrimination, one should agree to act according to\nthe order of the Supersoul. That will help one become situated constantly in\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, the highest perfectional stage of human life. Arjuna is\nbeing directly ordered by the Personality of Godhead to fight. Surrender to the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead is in the best interest of the living entities.\nIt is not for the interest of the Supreme. Before surrendering, one is free to\ndeliberate on this subject as far as the intelligence goes; that is the best way\nto accept the instruction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Such\ninstruction comes also through the spiritual master, the bona fide\nrepresentative of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\n\n\n18.64\n\n\nsarva-guhyatama\u1e41 bh\u016bya\u1e25\n\n\n\u015b\u1e5b\u1e47u me parama\u1e41 vaca\u1e25\n\n\ni\u1e63\u1e6do \u2019si me d\u1e5b\u1e0dham iti\n\n\ntato vak\u1e63y\u0101mi te hitam\n\n\nsarva-guhyatamam\u2014the most confidential; bh\u016bya\u1e25\u2014again; \u015b\u1e5b\u1e47u\u2014just hear; me\u2014from\nMe; paramam\u2014the supreme; vaca\u1e25\u2014instruction; is\u1e6da\u1e25 asi\u2014you are very dear to Me;\nd\u1e5b\u1e0dham\u2014very; iti\u2014thus; tata\u1e25\u2014therefore; vak\u1e63y\u0101mi\u2014speaking; te\u2014for your;\nhitam\u2014benefit.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nBecause you are My very dear friend, I am speaking to you the most confidential\npart of knowledge.

At the end of\nthe Ninth Chapter He has said, \u201cJust always think of Me.\u201d The same instruction\nis repeated here to stress the essence of the teachings of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. This\nessence is not understood by a common man, but by one who is actually very dear\nto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, a pure devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This is the most important instruction in all\nVedic literature. What K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is saying in this connection is the most essential\npart of knowledge, and it should be carried out not only by Arjuna but by all\nliving entities.\n\n\n18.65\n\n\nman-man\u0101 bhava mad-bhakto\n\n\nmad-y\u0101j\u012b m\u0101\u1e41 namaskuru\n\n\nm\u0101m evai\u1e63yasi satya\u1e41 te\n\n\npratij\u0101ne priyo \u2019si me\n\n\nman-man\u0101\u1e25\u2014thinking of Me; bhava\u2014just become; mat-bhakta\u1e25\u2014My devotee; mat-y\u0101j\u012b\u2014My\nworshiper; m\u0101m\u2014unto Me; namaskuru\u2014offer your obeisances; m\u0101m\u2014unto Me;\neva\u2014certainly; e\u1e63yasi\u2014come; satyam\u2014truly; te\u2014to you; pratij\u0101ne\u2014I promise;\nprija\u1e25\u2014dear; asi\u2014you are; me\u2014My.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nAlways think of Me and become My devotee. Worship Me and offer your homage unto\nMe. Thus you will come to Me without fail. I promise you this because you are My\nvery dear friend.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe most confidential part of knowledge is that one should become a pure devotee\nof K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and always think of Him and act for Him. One should not become an\nofficial meditator. Life should be so molded that one will always have the\nchance to think of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. One should always act in such a way that all his daily\nactivities are in connection with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He should arrange his life in such a\nway that throughout the twenty-four hours he cannot but think of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. And the\nLord\u2019s promise is that anyone who is in such pure K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness will\ncertainly return to the abode of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, where he will be engaged in the\nassociation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a face to face. This most confidential part of knowledge is\nspoken to Arjuna because he is the dear friend of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Everyone who follows\nthe path of Arjuna can become a dear friend to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and obtain the same\nperfection as Arjuna.\n\n\nThese words stress that one should concentrate his mind upon K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2014the very form\nwith two hands carrying a flute, the bluish boy with a beautiful face and\npeacock feathers in His hair. There are descriptions of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a found in the\nBrahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 and other literatures. One should fix his mind on this original\nform of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He should not even divert his attention to other forms\nof the Lord. The Lord has multi-forms, as Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, R\u0101ma, Var\u0101ha, etc.,\nbut a devotee should concentrate his mind on the form that was present before\nArjuna. Concentration of the mind on the form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a constitutes the most\nconfidential part of knowledge, and this is disclosed to Arjuna because Arjuna\nis the most dear friend of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s.\n\n\n18.66\n\n\nsarva-dharm\u0101n parityajya\n\n\nm\u0101m eka\u1e41 \u015bara\u1e47a\u1e41 vraja\n\n\naha\u1e41 tv\u0101\u1e41 sarva-p\u0101pebhyo\n\n\nmok\u1e63ayi\u1e63y\u0101mi m\u0101 \u015buca\u1e25\n\n\nsarva-dharm\u0101n\u2014all varieties of religion; parityajya\u2014abandoning; m\u0101m\u2014unto Me;\nekam\u2014only; \u015bara\u1e47am\u2014surrender; vraja\u2014go; aham\u2014I; tv\u0101m\u2014you; sarva\u2014all;\np\u0101pebhya\u1e25\u2014from sinful reactions; mok\u1e63ayi\u1e63y\u0101mi\u2014deliver; m\u0101\u2014not; \u015buca\u1e25\u2014worry.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nAbandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me.

Do not fear.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe Lord has described various kinds of knowledge, processes of religion,\nknowledge of the Supreme Brahman, knowledge of the Supersoul, knowledge of the\ndifferent types of orders and statuses of social life, knowledge of the\nrenounced order of life, knowledge of nonattachment, sense and mind control,\nmeditation, etc. He has described in so many ways different types of religion.\nNow, in summarizing Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, the Lord says that Arjuna should give up all\nthe processes that have been explained to him; he should simply surrender to\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. That surrender will save him from all kinds of sinful reactions, for the\nLord personally promises to protect him.\n\n\nIn the Eighth Chapter it was said that only one who has become free from all\nsinful reactions can take to the worship of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Thus one may think that\nunless he is free from all sinful reactions he cannot take to the surrendering\nprocess. To such doubts it is here said that even if one is not free from all\nsinful reactions, simply by the process of surrendering to \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a he is\nautomatically freed. There is no need of strenuous effort to free oneself from\nsinful reactions. One should unhesitatingly accept K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the supreme savior\nof all living entities. With faith and love, one should surrender unto Him.\n\n\nAccording to the devotional process, one should simply accept such religious\nprinciples that will lead ultimately to the devotional service of the Lord. One\nmay perform a particular occupational duty according to his position in the\nsocial order, but if by executing his duty one does not come to the point of\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, all his activities are in vain.\n\n\nAnything that does not lead to the perfectional stage of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness\nshould be avoided. One should be confident that in all circumstances K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a will\nprotect him from all difficulties. There is no need of thinking how one should\nkeep the body and soul together. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a will see to that. One should always think\nhimself helpless and should consider K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a the only basis for his progress in\nlife. As soon as one seriously engages himself in devotional service to the Lord\nin full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, at once he becomes freed from all contamination of\nmaterial nature. There are different processes of religion and purificatory\nprocesses by cultivation of knowledge, meditation in the mystic yoga system,\netc., but one who surrenders unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a does not have to execute so many\nmethods. That simple surrender unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a will save him from unnecessarily\nwasting time. One can thus make all progress at once and be freed from all\nsinful reaction.\n\n\nOne should be attracted by the beautiful vision of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. His name is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nbecause He is all-attractive. One who becomes attracted by the beautiful,\nall-powerful, omnipotent vision of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is fortunate. There are different kinds\nof transcendentalists\u2014some of them are attached to the impersonal Brahman\nvision, some of them are attracted by the Supersoul feature, etc., but one who\nis attracted to the personal feature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and,\nabove all, one who is attracted by the Supreme Personality of Godhead as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nHimself, is the most perfect transcendentalist. In other words, devotional\nservice to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, in full consciousness, is the most confidential part of\nknowledge, and this is the essence of the whole Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Karma-yog\u012bs,\nempiric philosophers, mystics, and devotees are all called transcendentalists,\nbut one who is a pure devotee is the best of all.

It is, however, sometimes\nfound that even demoniac persons who are envious of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, worshiping K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in a\ndifferent way, take to the profession of explaining Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 in a different\nway to make business, but anyone who desires actually to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a must\navoid such commentaries on Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Actually the purpose of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101\nis not understandable to those who are sensuous\u2014even if one is not sensuous but\nis strictly following the disciplines enjoined in the Vedic scripture, if he is\nnot a devotee, he also cannot understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Even when one poses himself as a\ndevotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but is not engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious activities, he also\ncannot understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. There are many persons who envy K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a because He has\nexplained in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that He is the Supreme and that nothing is above Him\nor equal to Him. There are many persons who are envious of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Such persons\nshould not be told of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, for they cannot understand.

In other words, Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is\nfor the devotees only, but it so happens that sometimes a devotee of the Lord\nwill hold open class, and in that class all the students are not expected to be\ndevotees. Why do such persons hold open class? It is explained here that\nalthough everyone is not a devotee, still there are many men who are not envious\nof K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. They have faith in Him as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If such\npersons hear from a bona fide devotee about the Lord, the result is that they\nbecome at once free from all sinful reactions and after that attain to the\nplanetary system where all righteous persons are situated. Therefore simply by\nhearing Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, even a person who does not try to be a pure devotee\nattains the result of righteous activities. Thus a pure devotee of the Lord\ngives everyone a chance to become free from all sinful reactions and to become a\ndevotee of the Lord.\n\n\nGenerally those who are free from sinful reaction are righteous. Such persons\nvery easily take to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. The word pu\u1e47ya-karma\u1e47\u0101m is very\nsignificant here. This refers to the performance of great sacrifice. Those who\nare righteous in performing devotional service but who are not pure can attain\nthe planetary system of the polestar, or Dhruvaloka, where Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja is\npresiding. He is a great devotee of the Lord, and he has a special planet which\nis called the polestar.\n\n\n18.72\n\n\nkaccid etac chruta\u1e41 p\u0101rtha\n\n\ntvayaik\u0101gre\u1e47a cetas\u0101\n\n\nkaccid aj\u00f1\u0101na-sammoha\u1e25\n\n\npra\u1e47a\u1e63\u1e6das te dhana\u00f1jaya\n\n\nkaccit\u2014whether; etat\u2014this; \u015brutam\u2014heard; p\u0101rtha\u2014O son of P\u1e5bth\u0101; tvay\u0101\u2014by you;\nek\u0101gre\u1e47a\u2014with full attention; cetas\u0101\u2014by the mind; kaccit\u2014whether;\naj\u00f1\u0101na\u2014ignorant; sa\u1e41moha\u1e25\u2014illusion; pra\u1e47a\u1e63\u1e6da\u1e25\u2014dispelled; te\u2014of you; dhana\u00f1jaya\u2014O\nconqueror of wealth (Arjuna).\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nO conqueror of wealth, Arjuna, have you heard this attentively with your mind?\nAnd are your illusions and ignorance now dispelled?\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe Lord was acting as the spiritual master of Arjuna.

If not, the Lord was ready to re-explain any point, or the\nwhole Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 if so required. Actually, anyone who hears Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101\nfrom a bona fide spiritual master like K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or His representative will find\nthat all his ignorance is dispelled.

I have\nregained my memory by Your mercy, and I am now firm and free from doubt and am\nprepared to act according to Your instructions.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe constitutional position of a living entity, represented by Arjuna, is that\nhe has to act according to the order of the Supreme Lord. He is meant for\nself-discipline. \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu says that the actual position of the\nliving entity is that of eternal servant of the Supreme Lord. Forgetting this\nprinciple, the living entity becomes conditioned by material nature, but in\nserving the Supreme Lord, he becomes the liberated servant of God. The living\nentity\u2019s constitutional position is to be servitor; he either has to serve the\nillusory m\u0101y\u0101 or the Supreme Lord. If he serves the Supreme Lord, he is in his\nnormal condition, but if he prefers to serve the illusory external energy, then\ncertainly he will be in bondage. In illusion the living entity is serving in\nthis material world. He is bound by his lust and desires, yet he thinks of\nhimself as the master of the world. This is called illusion. When a person is\nliberated, his illusion is over, and he voluntarily surrenders unto the Supreme\nto act according to His desires. The last illusion, the last snare of m\u0101y\u0101 to\ntrap the living entity, is the proposition that he is God. The living entity\nthinks that he is no longer a conditioned soul, but God. He is so unintelligent\nthat he does not think that if he were God, then how could he be in doubt? That\nhe does not consider. So that is the last snare of illusion. Actually to become\nfree from the illusory energy is to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead, and agree to act according to His order. The word moha\u1e25 is very\nimportant in this verse. Moha\u1e25 refers to that which is opposed to knowledge.\nActually real knowledge is the understanding that every living being is\neternally servitor of the Lord, but instead of thinking oneself in that\nposition, the living entity thinks that he is not servant, that he is the master\nof this material world, for he wants to lord it over the material nature. That\nis his illusion. This illusion can be overcome by the mercy of the Lord or by\nthe mercy of a pure devotee. When that illusion is over, one agrees to act in\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\n\n\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is acting according to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s order. A conditioned soul\nillusioned by the external energy of matter does not know that the Supreme Lord\nis the master who is full of knowledge and who is the proprietor of everything.\nWhatever He desires He can bestow upon His devotees; He is the friend of\neveryone, and He is especially inclined to His devotee. He is the controller of\nthis material nature and of all living entities. He is also the controller of\ninexhaustible time, and He is full of all opulences and all potencies. The\nSupreme Personality of Godhead can even give Himself to the devotee. One who\ndoes not know Him is under the spell of illusion; he does not become a devotee,\nbut a servitor of m\u0101y\u0101. Arjuna, however, after hearing Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 from the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead, became free from all illusion. He could\nunderstand that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was not only his friend, but the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead. And he understood K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a factually. So to study Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is to\nunderstand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a factually. When a person is in full knowledge, he naturally\nsurrenders to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. When Arjuna understood that it was K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s plan to reduce\nthe unnecessary increase of population, he agreed to fight according to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s\ndesire. He again took up his weapons\u2014his arrows and bow\u2014to fight under the order\nof the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\n\n\n18.74\n\n\nsa\u00f1jaya uv\u0101ca\n\n\nity aha\u1e41 v\u0101sudevasya\n\n\np\u0101rthasya ca mah\u0101tmana\u1e25\n\n\nsa\u1e41v\u0101dam imam a\u015brau\u1e63am\n\n\nadbhuta\u1e41 roma-har\u1e63a\u1e47am\n\n\nsa\u00f1jaya\u1e25 uv\u0101ca\u2014Sa\u00f1jaya said; iti\u2014thus; aham\u2014I; v\u0101sudevasya\u2014of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a;\np\u0101rthasya\u2014of Arjuna; ca\u2014also; mah\u0101tmana\u1e25\u2014two great souls; sa\u1e41v\u0101dam\u2014discussing;\nimam\u2014this; a\u015brau\u1e63am\u2014heard; adbhutam\u2014wonder; romahar\u1e63a\u1e47am\u2014hair standing on end.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nSa\u00f1jaya said: Thus have I heard the conversation of two great souls, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and\nArjuna. And so wonderful is that message that my hair is standing on end.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nIn the beginning of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra inquired from his secretary\nSa\u00f1jaya, \u201cWhat happened in the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra?\u201d The entire study was\nrelated to the heart of Sa\u00f1jaya by the grace of his spiritual master, Vy\u0101sa. He\nthus explained the theme of the battlefield. The conversation was wonderful\nbecause such an important conversation between two great souls never took place\nbefore and would not take place again. It is wonderful because the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead is speaking about Himself and His energies to the living\nentity, Arjuna, a great devotee of the Lord. If we follow in the footsteps of\nArjuna to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, then our life will be happy and successful. Sa\u00f1jaya\nrealized this, and as he began to understand it, he related the conversation to\nDh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra. Now it is concluded that wherever there is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Arjuna, there\nis victory.\n\n\n18.75\n\n\nvy\u0101sa-pras\u0101d\u0101c chrutav\u0101n\n\n\netad guhyam aha\u1e41 param\n\n\nyoga\u1e41 yoge\u015bvar\u0101t k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47\u0101t\n\n\ns\u0101k\u1e63\u0101t kathayata\u1e25 svayam\n\n\nvy\u0101sa-pras\u0101d\u0101t\u2014by the mercy of Vy\u0101sadeva; \u015brutav\u0101n\u2014heard; etat\u2014this;\nguhyam\u2014confidential; aham\u2014I; param\u2014the supreme; yogam\u2014mysticism; yoge\u015bvar\u0101t\u2014from\nthe master of all mysticism; k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47\u0101t\u2014from K\u1e5b\u1e63n.a; s\u0101k\u1e63\u0101t\u2014directly;\nkathayata\u1e25\u2014speaking; svayam\u2014personally.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nBy the mercy of Vy\u0101sa, I have heard these most confidential talks directly from\nthe master of all mysticism, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who was speaking personally to Arjuna.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nVy\u0101sa was the spiritual master of Sa\u00f1jaya, and Sa\u00f1jaya admits that it was by his\nmercy that he could understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This means\nthat one has to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a not directly but through the medium of the\nspiritual master. The spiritual master is the transparent medium, although it is\ntrue that the experience is direct. This is the mystery of the disciplic\nsuccession. When the spiritual master is bona fide, then one can hear\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 directly, as Arjuna heard it. There are many mystics and yog\u012bs all\nover the world, but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the master of all yoga systems. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s instruction\nis explicitly stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101\u2014surrender unto Kr\u1e63\u1e47a. One who does so is\nthe topmost yog\u012b. This is confirmed in the last verse of the Sixth Chapter.\nYogin\u0101m api sarve\u1e63\u0101m.\n\n\nN\u0101rada is the direct disciple of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and the spiritual master of Vy\u0101sa.\nTherefore Vy\u0101sa is as bona fide as Arjuna because he comes in the disciplic\nsuccession, and Sa\u00f1jaya is the direct disciple of Vy\u0101sa. Therefore by the grace\nof Vy\u0101sa, his senses were purified, and he could see and hear K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a directly.\nOne who directly hears K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can understand this confidential knowledge. If one\ndoes not come to the disciplic succession, he cannot hear K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; therefore his\nknowledge is always imperfect, at least as far as understanding Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is\nconcerned.\n\n\nIn Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, all the yoga systems, karma-yoga, j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga and bhakti-yoga,\nare explained. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the master of all such mysticism. It is to be\nunderstood, however, that as Arjuna was fortunate enough to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\ndirectly, similarly, by the grace of Vy\u0101sa, Sa\u00f1jaya was also able to hear K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\ndirectly. Actually there is no difference in hearing directly from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or\nhearing directly from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a via a bona fide spiritual master like Vy\u0101sa. The\nspiritual master is the representative of Vy\u0101sadeva also. According to the Vedic\nsystem, on the birthday of the spiritual master, the disciples conduct the\nceremony called Vy\u0101sa-p\u016bj\u0101.\n\n\n18.76\n\n\nr\u0101jan sa\u1e41sm\u1e5btya sa\u1e41sm\u1e5btya\n\n\nsa\u1e41v\u0101dam imam adbhutam\n\n\nke\u015bav\u0101rjunayo\u1e25 pu\u1e47ya\u1e41\n\n\nh\u1e5b\u1e63y\u0101mi ca muhur muhu\u1e25\n\n\nr\u0101jan\u2014O King; sa\u1e41sm\u1e5btya\u2014remembering; sa\u1e41sm\u1e5btya\u2014remembering; sa\u1e41v\u0101dam\u2014message;\nimam\u2014this; adbhutam\u2014wonderful; ke\u015bava\u2014Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; arjunayo\u1e25\u2014and Arjuna;\npu\u1e47yam\u2014pious; h\u1e5b\u1e63y\u0101mi\u2014taking pleasure; ca\u2014also; muhu\u1e25 muhu\u1e25\u2014always, repeatedly.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nO King, as I repeatedly recall this wondrous and holy dialogue between K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and\nArjuna, I take pleasure, being thrilled at every moment.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe understanding of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is so transcendental that anyone who becomes\nconversant with the topics of Arjuna and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a becomes righteous, and he cannot\nforget such talks. This is the transcendental position of spiritual life. In\nother words, one who hears the G\u012bt\u0101 from the right source, directly from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a,\nattains full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. The result of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is that one\nbecomes increasingly enlightened, and he enjoys life with a thrill, not only for\nsome time, but at every moment.\n\n\n18.77\n\n\ntac ca sa\u1e41sm\u1e5btya sa\u1e41sm\u1e5btya\n\n\nr\u016bpam aty-adbhuta\u1e41 hare\u1e25\n\n\nvismayo me mah\u0101n r\u0101jan\n\n\nh\u1e5b\u1e63y\u0101mi ca puna\u1e25 puna\u1e25\n\n\ntat\u2014that; ca\u2014also; sa\u1e41sm\u1e5btya\u2014remembering; sa\u1e41sm\u1e5btya\u2014remembering; r\u016bpam\u2014form;\nati\u2014great; adbhutam\u2014wonderful; hare\u1e25\u2014of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; vismaya\u1e25\u2014wonder; me\u2014my;\nmah\u0101n\u2014great; r\u0101jan\u2014O King, h\u1e5b\u1e63y\u0101mi\u2014enjoying; ca\u2014also; puna\u1e25 puna\u1e25\u2014repeatedly.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nO King, when I remember the wonderful form of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, I am struck with even\ngreater wonder, and I rejoice again and again.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nIt appears that Sa\u00f1jaya also, by the grace of Vy\u0101sa, could see the universal\nform of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a exhibited to Arjuna. It is, of course, said that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a never\nexhibited such a form before. It was exhibited to Arjuna only, yet some great\ndevotees could also see the universal form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a when it was shown to Arjuna,\nand Vy\u0101sa was one of them. He is one of the great devotees of the Lord, and he\nis considered to be a powerful incarnation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Vy\u0101sa disclosed this to his\ndisciple, Sa\u00f1jaya, who remembered that wonderful form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a exhibited to\nArjuna and enjoyed it repeatedly.\n\n\n18.78\n\n\nyatra yoge\u015bvara\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47o\n\n\nyatra p\u0101rtho dhanur-dhara\u1e25\n\n\ntatra \u015br\u012br vijayo bh\u016btir\n\n\ndhruv\u0101 n\u012btir matir mama\n\n\nyatra\u2014where; yoge\u015bvara\u1e25\u2014the master of mysticism; k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u1e25\u2014Lord Kr\u1e63na; yatra\u2014where;\np\u0101rtha\u1e25\u2014the son of P\u1e5bth\u0101; dhanur-dhara\u1e25\u2014the carrier of the bow and arrow;\ntatra\u2014there; \u015br\u012b\u1e25\u2014opulence; vijaya\u1e25\u2014victory; bh\u016bti\u1e25\u2014exceptional power;\ndhruv\u0101\u2014certainly; n\u012bti\u1e25\u2014morality; mati\u1e25 mama\u2014is my opinion.\n\n\nTRANSLATION\n\n\nWherever there is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the master of all mystics, and wherever there is\nArjuna, the supreme archer, there will also certainly be opulence, victory,\nextraordinary power, and morality. That is my opinion.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\n\nThe Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 began with an inquiry of Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra. He was hopeful of the\nvictory of his sons, assisted by great warriors like Bh\u012b\u1e63ma, Dro\u1e47a and Kar\u1e47a. He\nwas hopeful that the victory would be on his side. But, after describing the\nscene in the battlefield, Sa\u00f1jaya told the King, \u201cYou are thinking of victory,\nbut my opinion is that where K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Arjuna are present, there will be all\ngood fortune.\u201d He directly confirmed that Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra could not expect victory\nfor his side. Victory was certain for the side of Arjuna because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was\nthere. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s acceptance of the post of charioteer for Arjuna was an exhibition\nof another opulence. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is full of all opulences, and renunciation is one of\nthem. There are many instances of such renunciation, for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is also the\nmaster of renunciation.\n\n\nThe fight was actually between Duryodhana and Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira. Arjuna was fighting\non behalf of his elder brother, Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira. Because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Arjuna were on\nthe side of Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira\u2019s victory was certain. The battle was to\ndecide who would rule the world, and Sa\u00f1jaya predicted that the power would be\ntransferred to Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira. It is also predicted here that Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, after\ngaining victory in this battle, would flourish more and more because he was not\nonly righteous and pious, but he was a strict moralist. He never spoke a lie\nduring his life.\n\n\nThere are many less intelligent persons who take Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 to be a\ndiscussion of topics between two friends in a battlefield. But such a book\ncannot be scripture. Some may protest that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a incited Arjuna to fight, which\nis immoral, but the reality of the situation is clearly stated: Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is\nthe supreme instruction in morality. The supreme instruction of morality is\nstated in the Ninth Chapter, in the thirty-fourth verse: manman\u0101 bhava\nmad-bhakta\u1e25. One must become a devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and the essence of all religion\nis to surrender unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, as stated, Sarva-dharm\u0101n. The instructions of\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 constitute the supreme process of religion and of morality. All\nother processes may be purifying and may lead to this process, but the last\ninstruction of the G\u012bt\u0101 is the last word in all morality and religion: surrender\nunto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This is the verdict of the Eighteenth Chapter.\n\n\nFrom Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 we can understand that to realize oneself by philosophical\nspeculation and by meditation is one process, but to fully surrender unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nis the highest perfection. This is the essence of the teachings of\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. The path of regulative principles according to the orders of\nsocial life and according to the different courses of religion may be a\nconfidential path of knowledge in as far as the rituals of religion are\nconfidential, but one is still involved with meditation and cultivation of\nknowledge. Surrender unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in devotional service in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness is the most confidential instruction and is the essence of the\nEighteenth Chapter.\n\n\nAnother feature of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is that the actual truth is the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Absolute Truth is realized in three\nfeatures\u2014impersonal Brahman, localized Param\u0101tm\u0101, and the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Perfect knowledge of the Absolute Truth means perfect knowledge\nof K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. If one understands K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, then all the departments of knowledge are\npart and parcel of that understanding. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is transcendental, for He is always\nsituated in His eternal internal potency. The living entities are manifested and\nare divided into two classes, eternally conditioned and eternally liberated.\nSuch living entities are innumerable, and they are considered fundamental parts\nof K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Material energy is manifested into twenty-four divisions. The creation\nis effected by eternal time, and it is created and dissolved by external energy.\nThis manifestation of the cosmic world repeatedly becomes visible and invisible.\n\n\nIn Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 five principal subject matters have been discussed: the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead, material nature, the living entities, eternal time and\nall kinds of activities. All of these are dependant on the Supreme Personality\nof Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. All conceptions of the Absolute Truth, namely, impersonal\nBrahman, localized Param\u0101tm\u0101, or any other transcendental conception, exist\nwithin the category of understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\nAlthough superficially the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the living entity,\nmaterial nature and time appear to be different, nothing is different from the\nSupreme. But the Supreme is always different from everything. Lord Caitanya\u2019s\nphilosophy is that of \u201cinconceivably one and different.\u201d This system of\nphilosophy constitutes perfect knowledge of the Absolute Truth.\n\n\nThe living entity in his original position is pure spirit. He is just like an\natomic particle of the Supreme Spirit. The conditioned living entity, however,\nis the marginal energy of the Lord; he tends to be in contact with both the\nmaterial energy and the spiritual energy. In other words, the living entity is\nsituated between the two energies of the Lord, and because he belongs to the\nsuperior energy of the Lord, he has a particle of independence. By proper use of\nthat independence he comes under the direct order of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Thus he attains his\nnormal condition in the pleasure-giving potency.",

PURPORT  Actually the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is finished in seventeen chapters. The Eighteenth\nChapter is a supplementary summarization of the topics discussed before. In\nevery chapter of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a stresses that devotional service unto\nthe Supreme Personality of Godhead is the ultimate goal of life. This same point\nis summarized in the Eighteenth Chapter as the most confidential path of\nknowledge. In the first six chapters, stress was given to devotional service:\nyogin\u0101m api sarve\u1e63\u0101m\u2026 \u201cOf all yog\u012bs or transcendentalists, one who always thinks\nof Me within himself is best.\u201d In the next six chapters, pure devotional service\nand its nature and activity were discussed. In the third six chapters,\nknowledge, renunciation, the activities of material nature and transcendental\nnature, and devotional service were described. It was concluded that all acts\nshould be performed in conjunction with the Supreme Lord, summarized by the\nwords om tat sat, which indicate Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, the Supreme Person. In the third part of\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, devotional service was established by the example of past \u0101c\u0101ryas  and the Brahma-s\u016btra, the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra, which cites that devotional service is\nthe ultimate purpose of life and nothing else. Certain impersonalists consider\nthemselves monopolizers of the knowledge of Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra, but actually the\nVed\u0101nta-s\u016btra is meant for understanding devotional service, for the Lord\nHimself is the composer of the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra, and He is its knower. That is\ndescribed in the Fifteenth Chapter. In every scripture, every Veda, devotional\nservice is the objective. That is explained in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.  As in the Second Chapter a synopsis of the whole subject matter was described,\nsimilarly, in the Eighteenth Chapter also the summary of all instruction is\ngiven. The purpose of life is indicated to be renunciation and attainment of the\ntranscendental position above the three material modes of nature. Arjuna wants\nto clarify the two distinct subject matters of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, namely\nrenunciation (ty\u0101ga) and the renounced order of life (sanny\u0101sa). Thus he is\nasking the meaning of these two words.  Two words used in this verse to address the Supreme Lord\u2014H\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba and\nKe\u015binis\u016bdana\u2014are significant. H\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the master of all senses, who\ncan always help us attain mental serenity. Arjuna requests Him to summarize\neverything in such a way that he can remain equiposed. Yet he has some doubts,\nand doubts are always compared to demons. He therefore addresses K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as\nKe\u015binis\u016bdana. Ke\u015b\u012b was a most formidable demon who was killed by the Lord; now\nArjuna is expecting K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to kill the demon of doubt.",

For instance, it is said that an animal can be killed in a\nsacrifice, yet some maintain animal killing is completely abominable. Although\nanimal killing in a sacrifice is recommended in the Vedic literature, the animal\nis not considered to be killed. The sacrifice is to give a new life to the\nanimal. Sometimes the animal is given a new animal life after being killed in\nthe sacrifice, and sometimes the animal is promoted immediately to the human\nform of life. But there are different opinions among the sages. Some say that\nanimal killing should always be avoided, and others say that for a specific\nsacrifice it is good. All these different opinions on sacrificial activity are\nnow being clarified by the Lord Himself.",

TRANSLATION  Acts of sacrifice, charity and penance are not to be given up but should be\nperformed. Indeed, sacrifice, charity and penance purify even the great souls.  PURPORT  The yog\u012bs should perform acts for the advancement of human society. There are\nmany purificatory processes for advancing a human being to spiritual life. The\nmarriage ceremony, for example, is considered to be one of these sacrifices. It\nis called viv\u0101ha-yaj\u00f1a. Should a sanny\u0101s\u012b, who is in the renounced order of life\nand who has given up his family relations, encourage the marriage ceremony? The\nLord says here that any sacrifice which is meant for human welfare should never\nbe given up. Viv\u0101ha-yaj\u00f1a, the marriage ceremony, is meant to regulate the human\nmind to become peaceful for spiritual advancement. For most men, this\nviv\u0101ha-yaj\u00f1a should be encouraged even by persons in the renounced order of\nlife. Sannyas\u012bs should never associate with women, but that does not mean that\none who is in the lower stages of life, a young man, should not accept a wife in\nthe marriage ceremony. All prescribed sacrifices are meant for achieving the\nSupreme Lord. Therefore, in the lower stages, they should not be given up.\nSimilarly, charity is for the purification of the heart. If charity is given to\nsuitable persons, as described previously, it leads one to advanced spiritual\nlife.",

These are declared in s\u0101\u1e45khya philosophy to be the\nplace of action, the performer, the senses, the endeavor, and ultimately the\nSupersoul.  PURPORT  A question may be raised that since any activity performed must have some\nreaction, how is it that the person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness does not suffer or\nenjoy the reactions of work? The Lord is citing Ved\u0101nta philosophy to show how\nthis is possible. He says that there are five causes for all activities and for\nsuccess in all activity, and one should know these five causes. S\u0101\u1e45khya means\nthe stalk of knowledge, and Ved\u0101nta is the final stalk of knowledge accepted by\nall leading \u0101c\u0101ryas. Even \u015aa\u1e45kara accepts Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra as such. Therefore such\nauthority should be consulted.  The ultimate will is invested in the Supersoul, as it is stated in the G\u012bt\u0101,\n\u201csarvasya c\u0101ha\u1e41 h\u1e5bdi.\u201d He is engaging everyone in certain activities. Acts done\nunder His direction from within yield no reaction, either in this life or in the\nlife after death.  The instruments of action are the senses, and by senses the soul acts in various\nways, and for each and every action there is a different endeavor. But all one\u2019s\nactivities depend on the will of the Supersoul, who is seated within the heart\nas a friend. The Supreme Lord is the super cause. Under these circumstances, he\nwho is acting in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness under the direction of the Supersoul\nsituated within the heart is naturally not bound by any activity. Those in\ncomplete K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness are not ultimately responsible for their actions.\nEverything is dependant on the supreme will, the Supersoul, the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead.",

PURPORT  In this verse the Lord informs Arjuna that the desire not to fight arises from\nfalse ego. Arjuna thought himself to be the doer of action, but he did not\nconsider the Supreme sanction within and without. If one does not know that a\nsuper sanction is there, why should he act? But one who knows the instrument of\nwork, himself as the worker, and the Supreme Lord as the supreme sanctioner, is\nperfect in doing everything. Such a person is never in illusion. Personal\nactivity and responsibility arise from false ego and godlessness, or a lack of\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Anyone who is acting in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness under the\ndirection of the Supersoul or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, even though\nkilling, does not kill. Nor is he ever affected with the reaction of such\nkilling. When a soldier kills under the command of a superior officer, he is not\nsubject to be judged. But if a soldier kills on his own personal account, then\nhe is certainly judged by a court of law.",

PURPORT  There are three kinds of impetus for daily work: knowledge, the object of\nknowledge and the knower. The instruments of work, the work itself and the\nworker are called the constituents of work. Any work done by any human being has\nthese elements. Before one acts, there is some impetus, which is called\ninspiration. Any solution arrived at before work is actualized is a subtle form\nof work. Then work takes the form of action. First one has to undergo the\npsychological processes of thinking, feeling and willing, and that is called\nimpetus. Actually the faith to perform acts is called knowledge. The inspiration\nto work is the same if it comes from the scripture or from the instruction of\nthe spiritual master. When the inspiration is there and the worker is there,\nthen actual activity takes place by the help of the senses. The mind is the\ncenter of all senses, and the object is work itself. These are the different\nphases of work as described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. The sum total of all activities is\ncalled accumulation of work.",

PURPORT  In the Fourteenth Chapter the three divisions of the modes of material nature\nwere elaborately described. In that chapter it was said that the mode of\ngoodness is illuminating, the mode of passion materialistic, and the mode of\nignorance conducive to laziness and indolence. All the modes of material nature\nare binding; they are not sources of liberation. Even in the mode of goodness\none is conditioned. In the Seventeenth Chapter, the different types of worship\nby different types of men in different modes of material nature were described.\nIn this verse, the Lord wishes to speak about the different types of knowledge,\nworkers, and work itself according to the three material modes.",

In all living entities, one spirit soul is there, although\nthey have different bodies in terms of their previous work. As described in the\nSeventh Chapter, the manifestation of the living force in every body is due to\nthe superior nature of the Supreme Lord. Thus to see that one superior nature,\nthat living force, in every body is to see in the mode of goodness. That living\nenergy is imperishable, although the bodies are perishable.

Thus he\nchews the chewed, but, sometimes, in the course of such enjoyment, he becomes\nrelieved from material entanglement by association with a great soul. In other\nwords, a conditioned soul is always engaged in some type of sense gratification,\nbut when he understands by good association that it is only a repetition of the\nsame thing, and he is awakened to his real K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, he is sometimes\nrelieved from such repetitive so-called happiness.  In the pursuit of self-realization, one has to follow many rules and regulations\nto control the mind and the senses and to concentrate the mind on the Self. All\nthese procedures are very difficult, bitter like poison, but if one is\nsuccessful in following the regulations and comes to the transcendental\nposition, he begins to drink real nectar, and he enjoys life.",

TRANSLATION  By worship of the Lord, who is the source of all beings and who is\nall-pervading, man can, in the performance of his own duty, attain perfection.  PURPORT  As stated in the Fifteenth Chapter, all living beings are fragmental parts and\nparcels of the Supreme Lord. As such, the Supreme Lord is the beginning of all\nliving entities. This is confirmed in the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra\u2014janm\u0101dy asya yata\u1e25. The\nSupreme Lord is therefore the beginning of life of every living entity. And the\nSupreme Lord, by His two energies, His external energy and internal energy, is\nall-pervading. Therefore one should worship the Supreme Lord with His energies.\nGenerally the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava devotees worship the Supreme Lord with His internal\nenergy. His external energy is a perverted reflection of the internal energy.\nThe external energy is a background, but the Supreme Lord by the expansion of\nHis plenary portion as Param\u0101tm\u0101 is situated everywhere. He is the Supersoul of\nall demigods, all human beings, all animals, everywhere. One should therefore\nknow that as part and parcel of the Supreme Lord it is his duty to render\nservice unto the Supreme. Everyone should be engaged in devotional service to\nthe Lord in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. That is recommended in this verse.  Everyone should think that he is engaged in a particular type of occupation by\nH\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba, the master of the senses. And, by the result of the work in which one\nis engaged, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, should be worshiped.\nIf one thinks always in this way, in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, then, by the\ngrace of the Lord, he becomes fully aware of everything. That is the perfection\nof life. The Lord says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, te\u1e63\u0101m aha\u1e41 samuddhart\u0101. The Supreme\nLord Himself takes charge of delivering such a devotee. That is the highest\nperfection of life. In whatever occupation one may be engaged, if he serves the\nSupreme Lord, he will achieve the highest perfection.",

TRANSLATION  It is better to engage in one\u2019s own occupation, even though one may perform it\nimperfectly, than to accept another\u2019s occupation and perform it perfectly.\nPrescribed duties, according to one\u2019s nature, are never affected by sinful\nreactions.  PURPORT  One\u2019s occupational duty is prescribed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. As already discussed in\nprevious verses, the duties of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, k\u1e63atriya, vai\u015bya and \u015b\u016bdra are\nprescribed according to the particular modes of nature. One should not imitate\nanother\u2019s duty. Aman who is by nature attracted to the kind of work done by\n\u015b\u016bdras should not artificially claim himself to be a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, although he may\nbe born into a br\u0101hma\u1e47a family. In this way one should work according to his own\nnature; no work is abominable, if performed in the service of the Supreme Lord.\nThe occupational duty of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a is certainly in the mode of goodness, but if\na person is not by nature in the mode of goodness, he should not imitate the\noccupational duty of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a. For a k\u1e63atriya, or administrator, there are so\nmany abominable things; a k\u1e63atriya has to be violent to kill his enemies, and\nsometimes a k\u1e63atriya has to tell lies for the sake of diplomacy. Such violence\nand duplicity accompany political affairs, but a k\u1e63atriya is not supposed to\ngive up his occupational duty and try to perform the duties of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a.  One should act to satisfy the Supreme Lord. For example, Arjuna was a k\u1e63atriya.\nHe was hesitating to fight the other party. But if such fighting is performed\nfor the sake of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, there need be no fear\nof degradation. In the business field also, sometimes a merchant has to tell so\nmany lies to make a profit. If he does not do so, there can be no profit.\nSometimes a merchant says, \u201cOh, my dear customer, for you I am making no\nprofit,\u201d but one should know that without profit the merchant cannot exist.\nTherefore it should be taken as a simple lie if a merchant says that he is not\nmaking a profit. But the merchant should not think that because he is engaged in\nan occupation in which the telling of lies is compulsory, he should give up his\nprofession and pursue the profession of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a. That is not recommended.\nWhether one is a k\u1e63atriya, a vai\u015bya, or a \u015b\u016bdra doesn\u2019t matter, if he serves, by\nhis work, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Even br\u0101hma\u1e47as, who perform\ndifferent types of sacrifice, sometimes must kill animals because sometimes\nanimals are sacrificed in such ceremonies. Similarly, if a k\u1e63atriya engaged in\nhis own occupation kills an enemy, there is no sin incurred. In the Third\nChapter these matters have been clearly and elaborately explained; every man\nshould work for the purpose of yaj\u00f1a, or for Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead. Anything done for personal sense gratification is a cause of bondage.\nThe conclusion is that everyone should be engaged according to the particular\nmode of nature he has acquired, and he should decide to work only to serve the\nsupreme cause of the Supreme Lord.",

TRANSLATION  Every endeavor is covered by some sort of fault, just as fire is covered by\nsmoke. Therefore one should not give up the work which is born of his nature, O\nson of Kunt\u012b, even if such work is full of fault.  PURPORT  In conditioned life, all work is contaminated by the material modes of nature.\nEven if one is a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, he has to perform sacrifices in which animal killing\nis necessary. Similarly, a k\u1e63atriya, however pious he may be, has to fight\nenemies. He cannot avoid it. Similarly, a merchant, however pious he may be,\nmust sometimes hide his profit to stay in business, or he may sometimes have to\ndo business on the black market. These things are necessary; one cannot avoid\nthem. Similarly, even though a man is a \u015b\u016bdra serving a bad master, he has to\ncarry out the order of the master, even though it should not be done. Despite\nthese flaws, one should continue to carry out his prescribed duties, for they\nare born out of his own nature.  A very nice example is given herein. Although fire is pure, still there is\nsmoke. Yet smoke does not make the fire impure. Even though there is smoke in\nthe fire, fire is still considered to be the purest of all elements. If one\nprefers to give up the work of a k\u1e63atriya and take up the occupation of a\nbr\u0101hma\u1e47a, he is not assured that in the occupation of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a there are no\nunpleasant duties. One may then conclude that in the material world no one can\nbe completely free from the contamination of material nature. This example of\nfire and smoke is very appropriate in this connection. When in wintertime one\ntakes a stone from the fire, sometimes smoke disturbs the eyes and other parts\nof the body, but still one must make use of the fire despite disturbing\nconditions. Similarly, one should not give up his natural occupation because\nthere are some disturbing elements. Rather, one should be determined to serve\nthe Supreme Lord by his occupational duty in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. That is the\nperfectional point. When a particular type of occupation is performed for the\nsatisfaction of the Supreme Lord, all the defects in that particular occupation\nare purified. When the results of work are purified, when connected with\ndevotional service, one becomes perfect in seeing the self within, and that is\nself-realization.",

TRANSLATION  One can obtain the results of renunciation simply by self-control and by\nbecoming unattached to material things and disregarding material enjoyments.\nThat is the highest perfectional stage of renunciation.  PURPORT  Real renunciation means that one should always think himself part and parcel of\nthe Supreme Lord. Therefore he has no right to enjoy the results of his work.\nSince he is part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, the results of his work must be\nenjoyed by the Supreme Lord. This is actually Kr\u1e63na consciousness. The person\nacting in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is really a sanny\u0101s\u012b, one in the renounced order\nof life. By such mentality, one is satisfied because he is actually acting for\nthe Supreme. Thus he is not attached to anything material; he becomes accustomed\nto not taking pleasure in anything beyond the transcendental happiness derived\nfrom the service of the Lord. A sanny\u0101s\u012b is supposed to be free from the\nreactions of his past activities, but a person who is in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness\nautomatically attains this perfection without even accepting the so-called order\nof renunciation. This state of mind is called yog\u0101r\u016b\u1e0dha, or the perfectional\nstage of yoga, as confirmed in the Third Chapter: yas tv \u0101tma-ratir eva sy\u0101t.\nOne who is satisfied in himself has no fear of any kind of reaction from his\nactivity.",

He has no\nfalse ego because he does not accept the body as himself. Nor has he a desire to\nmake the body fat and strong by accepting so many material things. Because he\nhas no bodily concept of life, he is not falsely proud. He is satisfied with\neverything that is offered to him by the grace of the Lord, and he is never\nangry in the absence of sense gratification. Nor does he endeavor to acquire\nsense objects. Thus when he is completely free from false ego, he becomes\nnonattached to all material things, and that is the stage of self-realization of\nBrahman.

TRANSLATION  One who is thus transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme Brahman.\nHe never laments nor desires to have anything; he is equally disposed to every\nliving entity. In that state he attains pure devotional service unto Me.  PURPORT  To the impersonalist, achieving the brahma-bh\u016bta stage, becoming one with the\nAbsolute, is the last word. But for the personalist, or pure devotee, one has to\ngo still further to become engaged in pure devotional service. This means that\none who is engaged in pure devotional service to the Supreme Lord is already in\na state of liberation, called brahma-bh\u016bta, oneness with the Absolute. Without\nbeing one with the Supreme, the Absolute, one cannot render service unto Him. In\nthe absolute conception, there is no difference between the served and the\nservitor; yet the distinction is there, in a higher spiritual sense.  In the material concept of life, when one works for sense gratification, there\nis misery, but in the absolute world, when one is engaged in pure devotional\nservice, there is no misery. The devotee in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness has nothing to\nlament or desire. Since God is full, a living entity who is engaged in God\u2019s\nservice, in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, becomes also full in himself. He is just like a\nriver cleansed of all dirty water. Because a pure devotee has no thought other\nthan K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he is naturally always joyful. He does not lament for any material\nloss or gain because he is full in service of the Lord. He has no desire for\nmaterial enjoyment because he knows that every living entity is the fragmental\npart and parcel of the Supreme Lord and therefore eternally a servant. He does\nnot see, in the material world, someone as higher and someone as lower; higher\nand lower positions are ephemeral, and a devotee has nothing to do with\nephemeral appearances or disappearances. For him stone and gold are of equal\nvalue. This is the brahma-bh\u016bta stage, and this stage is attained very easily by\nthe pure devotee. In that stage of existence, the idea of becoming one with the\nSupreme Brahman and annihilating one\u2019s individuality becomes hellish, and the\nidea of attaining the heavenly kingdom becomes phantasmagoria, and the senses\nare like broken serpents\u2019 teeth. As there is no fear of a serpent with broken\nteeth, so there is no fear from the senses when they are automatically\ncontrolled. The world is miserable for the materially infected person, but for a\ndevotee the entire world is as good as Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha, or the spiritual sky. The\nhighest personality in this material universe is no more significant than an ant\nfor a devotee. Such a stage can be achieved by the mercy of Lord Caitanya, who\npreached pure devotional service in this age.",

PURPORT  The Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and His plenary portions cannot be\nunderstood by mental speculation nor by the nondevotees. If anyone wants to\nunderstand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he has to take to pure devotional\nservice under the guidance of a pure devotee. Otherwise, the truth of the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead will always be hidden. It is already stated\n(n\u0101ha\u1e41 prak\u0101\u015ba\u1e25) that He is not revealed to everyone. Everyone cannot understand\nGod simply by erudite scholarship or mental speculation. Only one who is\nactually engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and devotional service can understand\nwhat K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is. University degrees are not helpful.  One who is fully conversant with the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a science becomes eligible to enter\ninto the spiritual kingdom, the abode of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Becoming Brahman does not mean\nthat one loses his identity. Devotional service is there, and as long as\ndevotional service exists, there must be God, the devotee, and the process of\ndevotional service. Such knowledge is never vanquished, even after liberation.\nLiberation involves getting free from the concept of material life; in spiritual\nlife the same distinction is there, the same individuality is there, but in pure\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. One should not misunderstand that the word vi\u015bate, \u201centers\ninto Me,\u201d supports the monist theory that one becomes homogeneous with the\nimpersonal Brahman. No. Vi\u015bate means that one can enter into the abode of the\nSupreme Lord in his individuality to engage in His association and render\nservice unto Him. For instance, a green bird enters a green tree not to become\none with the tree but to enjoy the fruits of the tree. Impersonalists generally\ngive the example of a river flowing into the ocean and merging. This may be a\nsource of happiness for the impersonalist, but the personalist keeps his\npersonal individuality like an aquatic in the ocean. We find so many living\nentities within the ocean, if we go deep. Surface acquaintance with the ocean is\nnot sufficient; one must have complete knowledge of the aquatics living in the\nocean depths.  Because of his pure devotional service, a devotee can understand the\ntranscendental qualities and the opulences of the Supreme Lord in truth. As it\nis stated in the Eleventh Chapter, only by devotional service can one\nunderstand. The same is confirmed here; one can understand the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead by devotional service and enter into His kingdom.  After attainment of the brahma-bh\u016bta stage of freedom from material conceptions,\ndevotional service begins by one\u2019s hearing about the Lord. When one hears about\nthe Supreme Lord, automatically the brahma-bh\u016bta stage develops, and material\ncontamination\u2014greediness and lust for sense enjoyment\u2014disappears. As lust and\ndesires disappear from the heart of a devotee, he becomes more attached to the\nservice of the Lord, and by such attachment he becomes free from material\ncontamination. In that state of life he can understand the Supreme Lord. This is\nthe statement of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam also. Also after liberation the process of\nbhakti or transcendental service continues. The Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra confirms this:\n\u0101pr\u0101ya\u1e47\u0101t tatr\u0101pi hi d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dam. This means that after liberation the process of\ndevotional service continues. In the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, real devotional\nliberation is defined as the reinstatement of the living entity in his own\nidentity, his own constitutional position. The constitutional position is\nalready explained: every living entity is the part and parcel fragmental portion\nof the Supreme Lord. Therefore his constitutional position is to serve. After\nliberation, this service is never stopped. Actual liberation is getting free\nfrom misconceptions of life.",

PURPORT  When one acts in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, he does not act as the master of the\nworld. Just like a servant, one should act fully under the direction of the\nSupreme Lord. A servant has no individual independence. He acts only on the\norder of the master. A servant acting on behalf of the supreme master has no\naffection for profit and loss. He simply discharges his duty faithfully in terms\nof the order of the Lord. Now, one may argue that Arjuna was acting under the\npersonal direction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but, when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not present, how should one act?\nIf one acts according to the direction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in this book, as well as under\nthe guidance of the representative of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, then the result will be the same.\nThe Sanskrit word mat-para\u1e25 is very important in this verse. It indicates that\none has no goal in life save and except acting in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness just to\nsatisfy K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. And, while working in that way, one should think of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a only:\n\u201cI have been appointed to discharge this particular duty by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u201d While acting\nin such a way, one naturally has to think of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This is perfect K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness. One should, however, note that, after doing something\nwhimsically, he should not offer the result to the Supreme Lord. That sort of\nduty is not in the devotional service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. One should act\naccording to the order of Kr\u1e63na. This is a very important point. That order of\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a comes through disciplic succession from the bona fide spiritual master.\nTherefore the spiritual master\u2019s order should be taken as the prime duty of\nlife. If one gets a bona fide spiritual master and acts according to his\ndirection, then his perfection of life in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is guaranteed.",

For one who acts in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a becomes the most\nintimate friend.

Therefore, no one should be carried away by the false\nego of the bodily concept of life. One should not falsely think himself\nindependant of the laws of material nature or free to act. He is already under\nstrict material laws. But, as soon as he acts in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, he is\nliberated, free from the material perplexities. One should note very carefully\nthat one who is not active in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is losing himself in the\nmaterial whirlpool, in the ocean of birth and death. No conditioned soul\nactually knows what is to be done and what is not to be done, but a person who\nacts in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is free to act because everything is prompted by\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a from within and confirmed by the spiritual master.",

No one can ascertain his destiny as the Supreme Lord\ncan; therefore the best course is to take direction from the Supreme Lord and\nact. No one should neglect the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead or\nthe order of the spiritual master who is the representative of God. One should\nact unhesitatingly to execute the order of the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead\u2014that will keep him safe under all circumstances.",

PURPORT  Arjuna was not the supreme knower, and his decision to fight or not to fight was\nconfined to his limited discretion. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a instructed that the individual is\nnot all in all. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, or He Himself, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the\nlocalized Supersoul, sits in the heart directing the living being. After\nchanging bodies, the living entity forgets his past deeds, but the Supersoul, as\nthe knower of the past, present and future, remains the witness of all his\nactivities. Therefore all the activities of living entities are directed by this\nSupersoul. The living entity gets what he deserves and is carried by the\nmaterial body which is created in the material energy under the direction of the\nSupersoul. As soon as a living entity is placed in a particular type of body, he\nhas to work under the spell of that bodily situation. A person seated in a\nhigh-speed motor car goes faster than one seated in a slower car, though the\nliving entities, the drivers, may be the same. Similarly, by the order of the\nSupreme Soul, material nature fashions a particular type of body to a particular\ntype of living entity to work according to his past desires. The living entity\nis not independant. One should not think himself independant of the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead. The individual is always under His control. Therefore\nhis duty is to surrender, and that is the injunction of the next verse.",

PURPORT  A living entity should therefore surrender unto the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead who is situated in everyone\u2019s heart, and that will relieve him from all\nkinds of miseries of this material existence. By such surrender, one will not\nonly be released from all miseries in this life, but at the end he will reach\nthe Supreme God. The transcendental world is described in the Vedic literature\nas tad vi\u1e63\u1e47o\u1e25 parama\u1e41 padam. Since all of creation is the kingdom of God,\neverything material is actually spiritual, but parama\u1e41 padam specifically refers\nto the eternal abode, which is called the spiritual sky or Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha.

Arjuna has accepted K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead and the supreme abode of all living entities, not only\nbecause of his personal experience but also because of the evidences of great\nauthorities like N\u0101rada, Asita, Devala and Vy\u0101sa.",

PURPORT  The Lord has already explained to Arjuna the knowledge of brahmabh\u016bta. One who\nis in the brahma-bh\u016bta condition is joyful; he never laments, nor does he desire\nanything. That is due to confidential knowledge. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a also discloses knowledge\nof the Supersoul. This is also Brahman knowledge, knowledge of Brahman, but it\nis superior.  Here Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a telIs Arjuna that he can do as he chooses. God does not\ninterfere with the little independence of the living entity. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101,\nthe Lord has explained in all respects how one can elevate his living condition.\nThe best advice imparted to Arjuna is to surrender unto the Supersoul seated\nwithin his heart. By right discrimination, one should agree to act according to\nthe order of the Supersoul. That will help one become situated constantly in\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, the highest perfectional stage of human life. Arjuna is\nbeing directly ordered by the Personality of Godhead to fight. Surrender to the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead is in the best interest of the living entities.\nIt is not for the interest of the Supreme. Before surrendering, one is free to\ndeliberate on this subject as far as the intelligence goes; that is the best way\nto accept the instruction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

PURPORT  The most confidential part of knowledge is that one should become a pure devotee\nof K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and always think of Him and act for Him. One should not become an\nofficial meditator. Life should be so molded that one will always have the\nchance to think of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. One should always act in such a way that all his daily\nactivities are in connection with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He should arrange his life in such a\nway that throughout the twenty-four hours he cannot but think of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. And the\nLord\u2019s promise is that anyone who is in such pure K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness will\ncertainly return to the abode of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, where he will be engaged in the\nassociation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a face to face. This most confidential part of knowledge is\nspoken to Arjuna because he is the dear friend of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Everyone who follows\nthe path of Arjuna can become a dear friend to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and obtain the same\nperfection as Arjuna.  These words stress that one should concentrate his mind upon K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2014the very form\nwith two hands carrying a flute, the bluish boy with a beautiful face and\npeacock feathers in His hair. There are descriptions of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a found in the\nBrahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 and other literatures. One should fix his mind on this original\nform of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He should not even divert his attention to other forms\nof the Lord. The Lord has multi-forms, as Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, R\u0101ma, Var\u0101ha, etc.,\nbut a devotee should concentrate his mind on the form that was present before\nArjuna. Concentration of the mind on the form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a constitutes the most\nconfidential part of knowledge, and this is disclosed to Arjuna because Arjuna\nis the most dear friend of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s.",

TRANSLATION  Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me. I shall deliver\nyou from all sinful reaction. Do not fear.  PURPORT  The Lord has described various kinds of knowledge, processes of religion,\nknowledge of the Supreme Brahman, knowledge of the Supersoul, knowledge of the\ndifferent types of orders and statuses of social life, knowledge of the\nrenounced order of life, knowledge of nonattachment, sense and mind control,\nmeditation, etc. He has described in so many ways different types of religion.\nNow, in summarizing Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, the Lord says that Arjuna should give up all\nthe processes that have been explained to him; he should simply surrender to\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. That surrender will save him from all kinds of sinful reactions, for the\nLord personally promises to protect him.  In the Eighth Chapter it was said that only one who has become free from all\nsinful reactions can take to the worship of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Thus one may think that\nunless he is free from all sinful reactions he cannot take to the surrendering\nprocess. To such doubts it is here said that even if one is not free from all\nsinful reactions, simply by the process of surrendering to \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a he is\nautomatically freed. There is no need of strenuous effort to free oneself from\nsinful reactions. One should unhesitatingly accept K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the supreme savior\nof all living entities. With faith and love, one should surrender unto Him.  According to the devotional process, one should simply accept such religious\nprinciples that will lead ultimately to the devotional service of the Lord. One\nmay perform a particular occupational duty according to his position in the\nsocial order, but if by executing his duty one does not come to the point of\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, all his activities are in vain.  Anything that does not lead to the perfectional stage of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness\nshould be avoided. One should be confident that in all circumstances K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a will\nprotect him from all difficulties. There is no need of thinking how one should\nkeep the body and soul together. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a will see to that. One should always think\nhimself helpless and should consider K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a the only basis for his progress in\nlife. As soon as one seriously engages himself in devotional service to the Lord\nin full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, at once he becomes freed from all contamination of\nmaterial nature. There are different processes of religion and purificatory\nprocesses by cultivation of knowledge, meditation in the mystic yoga system,\netc., but one who surrenders unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a does not have to execute so many\nmethods. That simple surrender unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a will save him from unnecessarily\nwasting time. One can thus make all progress at once and be freed from all\nsinful reaction.  One should be attracted by the beautiful vision of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. His name is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nbecause He is all-attractive. One who becomes attracted by the beautiful,\nall-powerful, omnipotent vision of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is fortunate. There are different kinds\nof transcendentalists\u2014some of them are attached to the impersonal Brahman\nvision, some of them are attracted by the Supersoul feature, etc., but one who\nis attracted to the personal feature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and,\nabove all, one who is attracted by the Supreme Personality of Godhead as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nHimself, is the most perfect transcendentalist. In other words, devotional\nservice to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, in full consciousness, is the most confidential part of\nknowledge, and this is the essence of the whole Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Karma-yog\u012bs,\nempiric philosophers, mystics, and devotees are all called transcendentalists,\nbut one who is a pure devotee is the best of all. The particular words used\nhere, m\u0101 \u015buca\u1e25, \u201cDon\u2019t fear, don\u2019t hesitate, don\u2019t worry,\u201d are very significant.\nOne may be perplexed as to how one can give up all kinds of religious forms and\nsimply surrender unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but such worry is useless.",

Actually the purpose of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101\nis not understandable to those who are sensuous\u2014even if one is not sensuous but\nis strictly following the disciplines enjoined in the Vedic scripture, if he is\nnot a devotee, he also cannot understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Even when one poses himself as a\ndevotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but is not engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious activities, he also\ncannot understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. There are many persons who envy K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a because He has\nexplained in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that He is the Supreme and that nothing is above Him\nor equal to Him. There are many persons who are envious of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Such persons\nshould not be told of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, for they cannot understand. There is no\npossibility of faithless persons\u2019 understanding Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Without\nunderstanding K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a from the authority of a pure devotee, one should not try to\ncomment upon Bhagavad-git\u0101.",

TRANSLATION  And one who listens with faith and without envy becomes free from sinful\nreaction and attains to the planets where the pious dwell.  PURPORT  In the 67th verse of this chapter, the Lord explicitly forbade the G\u012bt\u0101\u2019s being\nspoken to those who are envious of the Lord. In other words, Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is\nfor the devotees only, but it so happens that sometimes a devotee of the Lord\nwill hold open class, and in that class all the students are not expected to be\ndevotees. Why do such persons hold open class? It is explained here that\nalthough everyone is not a devotee, still there are many men who are not envious\nof K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. They have faith in Him as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If such\npersons hear from a bona fide devotee about the Lord, the result is that they\nbecome at once free from all sinful reactions and after that attain to the\nplanetary system where all righteous persons are situated. Therefore simply by\nhearing Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, even a person who does not try to be a pure devotee\nattains the result of righteous activities. Thus a pure devotee of the Lord\ngives everyone a chance to become free from all sinful reactions and to become a\ndevotee of the Lord.  Generally those who are free from sinful reaction are righteous. Such persons\nvery easily take to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. The word pu\u1e47ya-karma\u1e47\u0101m is very\nsignificant here. This refers to the performance of great sacrifice. Those who\nare righteous in performing devotional service but who are not pure can attain\nthe planetary system of the polestar, or Dhruvaloka, where Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja is\npresiding. He is a great devotee of the Lord, and he has a special planet which\nis called the polestar.",

TRANSLATION  Arjuna said, My dear K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, O infallible one, my illusion is now gone. I have\nregained my memory by Your mercy, and I am now firm and free from doubt and am\nprepared to act according to Your instructions.  PURPORT  The constitutional position of a living entity, represented by Arjuna, is that\nhe has to act according to the order of the Supreme Lord. He is meant for\nself-discipline. \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu says that the actual position of the\nliving entity is that of eternal servant of the Supreme Lord. Forgetting this\nprinciple, the living entity becomes conditioned by material nature, but in\nserving the Supreme Lord, he becomes the liberated servant of God. The living\nentity\u2019s constitutional position is to be servitor; he either has to serve the\nillusory m\u0101y\u0101 or the Supreme Lord. If he serves the Supreme Lord, he is in his\nnormal condition, but if he prefers to serve the illusory external energy, then\ncertainly he will be in bondage. In illusion the living entity is serving in\nthis material world. He is bound by his lust and desires, yet he thinks of\nhimself as the master of the world. This is called illusion. When a person is\nliberated, his illusion is over, and he voluntarily surrenders unto the Supreme\nto act according to His desires. The last illusion, the last snare of m\u0101y\u0101 to\ntrap the living entity, is the proposition that he is God. The living entity\nthinks that he is no longer a conditioned soul, but God. He is so unintelligent\nthat he does not think that if he were God, then how could he be in doubt? That\nhe does not consider. So that is the last snare of illusion. Actually to become\nfree from the illusory energy is to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead, and agree to act according to His order. The word moha\u1e25 is very\nimportant in this verse. Moha\u1e25 refers to that which is opposed to knowledge.\nActually real knowledge is the understanding that every living being is\neternally servitor of the Lord, but instead of thinking oneself in that\nposition, the living entity thinks that he is not servant, that he is the master\nof this material world, for he wants to lord it over the material nature. That\nis his illusion. This illusion can be overcome by the mercy of the Lord or by\nthe mercy of a pure devotee. When that illusion is over, one agrees to act in\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.  K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is acting according to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s order. A conditioned soul\nillusioned by the external energy of matter does not know that the Supreme Lord\nis the master who is full of knowledge and who is the proprietor of everything.\nWhatever He desires He can bestow upon His devotees; He is the friend of\neveryone, and He is especially inclined to His devotee. He is the controller of\nthis material nature and of all living entities. He is also the controller of\ninexhaustible time, and He is full of all opulences and all potencies. The\nSupreme Personality of Godhead can even give Himself to the devotee. One who\ndoes not know Him is under the spell of illusion; he does not become a devotee,\nbut a servitor of m\u0101y\u0101. Arjuna, however, after hearing Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 from the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead, became free from all illusion. He could\nunderstand that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was not only his friend, but the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead. And he understood K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a factually. So to study Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is to\nunderstand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a factually. When a person is in full knowledge, he naturally\nsurrenders to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. When Arjuna understood that it was K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s plan to reduce\nthe unnecessary increase of population, he agreed to fight according to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s\ndesire. He again took up his weapons\u2014his arrows and bow\u2014to fight under the order\nof the Supreme Personality of Godhead.",

He\nthus explained the theme of the battlefield. The conversation was wonderful\nbecause such an important conversation between two great souls never took place\nbefore and would not take place again. It is wonderful because the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead is speaking about Himself and His energies to the living\nentity, Arjuna, a great devotee of the Lord. If we follow in the footsteps of\nArjuna to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, then our life will be happy and successful. Sa\u00f1jaya\nrealized this, and as he began to understand it, he related the conversation to\nDh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra.

TRANSLATION  By the mercy of Vy\u0101sa, I have heard these most confidential talks directly from\nthe master of all mysticism, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who was speaking personally to Arjuna.  PURPORT  Vy\u0101sa was the spiritual master of Sa\u00f1jaya, and Sa\u00f1jaya admits that it was by his\nmercy that he could understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This means\nthat one has to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a not directly but through the medium of the\nspiritual master. The spiritual master is the transparent medium, although it is\ntrue that the experience is direct. This is the mystery of the disciplic\nsuccession. When the spiritual master is bona fide, then one can hear\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 directly, as Arjuna heard it. There are many mystics and yog\u012bs all\nover the world, but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the master of all yoga systems. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s instruction\nis explicitly stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101\u2014surrender unto Kr\u1e63\u1e47a. One who does so is\nthe topmost yog\u012b. This is confirmed in the last verse of the Sixth Chapter.\nYogin\u0101m api sarve\u1e63\u0101m.  N\u0101rada is the direct disciple of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and the spiritual master of Vy\u0101sa.\nTherefore Vy\u0101sa is as bona fide as Arjuna because he comes in the disciplic\nsuccession, and Sa\u00f1jaya is the direct disciple of Vy\u0101sa. Therefore by the grace\nof Vy\u0101sa, his senses were purified, and he could see and hear K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a directly.\nOne who directly hears K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can understand this confidential knowledge. If one\ndoes not come to the disciplic succession, he cannot hear K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; therefore his\nknowledge is always imperfect, at least as far as understanding Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is\nconcerned.  In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, all the yoga systems, karma-yoga, j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga and bhakti-yoga,\nare explained. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the master of all such mysticism. It is to be\nunderstood, however, that as Arjuna was fortunate enough to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\ndirectly, similarly, by the grace of Vy\u0101sa, Sa\u00f1jaya was also able to hear K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\ndirectly. Actually there is no difference in hearing directly from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or\nhearing directly from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a via a bona fide spiritual master like Vy\u0101sa. The\nspiritual master is the representative of Vy\u0101sadeva also.

TRANSLATION  O King, as I repeatedly recall this wondrous and holy dialogue between K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and\nArjuna, I take pleasure, being thrilled at every moment.  PURPORT  The understanding of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is so transcendental that anyone who becomes\nconversant with the topics of Arjuna and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a becomes righteous, and he cannot\nforget such talks. This is the transcendental position of spiritual life. In\nother words, one who hears the G\u012bt\u0101 from the right source, directly from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a,\nattains full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. The result of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is that one\nbecomes increasingly enlightened, and he enjoys life with a thrill, not only for\nsome time, but at every moment.",

PURPORT  It appears that Sa\u00f1jaya also, by the grace of Vy\u0101sa, could see the universal\nform of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a exhibited to Arjuna. It is, of course, said that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a never\nexhibited such a form before. It was exhibited to Arjuna only, yet some great\ndevotees could also see the universal form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a when it was shown to Arjuna,\nand Vy\u0101sa was one of them. He is one of the great devotees of the Lord, and he\nis considered to be a powerful incarnation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Vy\u0101sa disclosed this to his\ndisciple, Sa\u00f1jaya, who remembered that wonderful form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a exhibited to\nArjuna and enjoyed it repeatedly.",

TRANSLATION  Wherever there is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the master of all mystics, and wherever there is\nArjuna, the supreme archer, there will also certainly be opulence, victory,\nextraordinary power, and morality. That is my opinion.  PURPORT  The Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 began with an inquiry of Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra. He was hopeful of the\nvictory of his sons, assisted by great warriors like Bh\u012b\u1e63ma, Dro\u1e47a and Kar\u1e47a. He\nwas hopeful that the victory would be on his side. But, after describing the\nscene in the battlefield, Sa\u00f1jaya told the King, \u201cYou are thinking of victory,\nbut my opinion is that where K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Arjuna are present, there will be all\ngood fortune.\u201d He directly confirmed that Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra could not expect victory\nfor his side. Victory was certain for the side of Arjuna because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was\nthere. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s acceptance of the post of charioteer for Arjuna was an exhibition\nof another opulence. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is full of all opulences, and renunciation is one of\nthem. There are many instances of such renunciation, for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is also the\nmaster of renunciation.  The fight was actually between Duryodhana and Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira. Arjuna was fighting\non behalf of his elder brother, Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira. Because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Arjuna were on\nthe side of Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira\u2019s victory was certain. The battle was to\ndecide who would rule the world, and Sa\u00f1jaya predicted that the power would be\ntransferred to Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira. It is also predicted here that Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, after\ngaining victory in this battle, would flourish more and more because he was not\nonly righteous and pious, but he was a strict moralist. He never spoke a lie\nduring his life.  There are many less intelligent persons who take Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 to be a\ndiscussion of topics between two friends in a battlefield. But such a book\ncannot be scripture. Some may protest that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a incited Arjuna to fight, which\nis immoral, but the reality of the situation is clearly stated: Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is\nthe supreme instruction in morality. The supreme instruction of morality is\nstated in the Ninth Chapter, in the thirty-fourth verse: manman\u0101 bhava\nmad-bhakta\u1e25. One must become a devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and the essence of all religion\nis to surrender unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, as stated, Sarva-dharm\u0101n. The instructions of\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 constitute the supreme process of religion and of morality. All\nother processes may be purifying and may lead to this process, but the last\ninstruction of the G\u012bt\u0101 is the last word in all morality and religion: surrender\nunto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This is the verdict of the Eighteenth Chapter.  From Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 we can understand that to realize oneself by philosophical\nspeculation and by meditation is one process, but to fully surrender unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nis the highest perfection. This is the essence of the teachings of\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. The path of regulative principles according to the orders of\nsocial life and according to the different courses of religion may be a\nconfidential path of knowledge in as far as the rituals of religion are\nconfidential, but one is still involved with meditation and cultivation of\nknowledge. Surrender unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in devotional service in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nconsciousness is the most confidential instruction and is the essence of the\nEighteenth Chapter.  Another feature of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is that the actual truth is the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Absolute Truth is realized in three\nfeatures\u2014impersonal Brahman, localized Param\u0101tm\u0101, and the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Perfect knowledge of the Absolute Truth means perfect knowledge\nof K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. If one understands K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, then all the departments of knowledge are\npart and parcel of that understanding. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is transcendental, for He is always\nsituated in His eternal internal potency. The living entities are manifested and\nare divided into two classes, eternally conditioned and eternally liberated.\nSuch living entities are innumerable, and they are considered fundamental parts\nof K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Material energy is manifested into twenty-four divisions. The creation\nis effected by eternal time, and it is created and dissolved by external energy.\nThis manifestation of the cosmic world repeatedly becomes visible and invisible.  In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 five principal subject matters have been discussed: the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead, material nature, the living entities, eternal time and\nall kinds of activities. All of these are dependant on the Supreme Personality\nof Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. All conceptions of the Absolute Truth, namely, impersonal\nBrahman, localized Param\u0101tm\u0101, or any other transcendental conception, exist\nwithin the category of understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\nAlthough superficially the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the living entity,\nmaterial nature and time appear to be different, nothing is different from the\nSupreme. But the Supreme is always different from everything. Lord Caitanya\u2019s\nphilosophy is that of \u201cinconceivably one and different.\u201d This system of\nphilosophy constitutes perfect knowledge of the Absolute Truth.  The living entity in his original position is pure spirit. He is just like an\natomic particle of the Supreme Spirit. The conditioned living entity, however,\nis the marginal energy of the Lord; he tends to be in contact with both the\nmaterial energy and the spiritual energy. In other words, the living entity is\nsituated between the two energies of the Lord, and because he belongs to the\nsuperior energy of the Lord, he has a particle of independence. By proper use of\nthat independence he comes under the direct order of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Thus he attains his\nnormal condition in the pleasure-giving potency.",
