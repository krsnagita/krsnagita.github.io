<p>O King, when I remember the wonderful form of Lord Kṛṣṇa, I am struck with even

<p>PURPORT</p>
<p>It appears that Sañjaya also, by the grace of Vyāsa, could see the universal
form of Kṛṣṇa exhibited to Arjuna. It is, of course, said that Lord Kṛṣṇa never
exhibited such a form before. It was exhibited to Arjuna only, yet some great
devotees could also see the universal form of Kṛṣṇa when it was shown to Arjuna,
and Vyāsa was one of them. He is one of the great devotees of the Lord, and he
is considered to be a powerful incarnation of Kṛṣṇa. Vyāsa disclosed this to his
disciple, Sañjaya, who remembered that wonderful form of Kṛṣṇa exhibited to
Arjuna and enjoyed it repeatedly.</p>

<p>TRANSLATION</p>
<p>Wherever there is Kṛṣṇa, the master of all mystics, and wherever there is
Arjuna, the supreme archer, there will also certainly be opulence, victory,
extraordinary power, and morality. That is my opinion.</p>
<p>PURPORT</p>
<p>The Bhagavad-gītā began with an inquiry of Dhṛtarāṣṭra. He was hopeful of the
victory of his sons, assisted by great warriors like Bhīṣma, Droṇa and Karṇa. He
was hopeful that the victory would be on his side. But, after describing the
scene in the battlefield, Sañjaya told the King, “You are thinking of victory,
but my opinion is that where Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna are present, there will be all
good fortune.” He directly confirmed that Dhṛtarāṣṭra could not expect victory
for his side. Victory was certain for the side of Arjuna because Kṛṣṇa was
there. Kṛṣṇa’s acceptance of the post of charioteer for Arjuna was an exhibition
of another opulence. Kṛṣṇa is full of all opulences, and renunciation is one of
them. There are many instances of such renunciation, for Kṛṣṇa is also the
master of renunciation.</p>
<p>The fight was actually between Duryodhana and Yudhiṣṭhira. Arjuna was fighting
on behalf of his elder brother, Yudhiṣṭhira. Because Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna were on
the side of Yudhiṣṭhira, Yudhiṣṭhira’s victory was certain. The battle was to
decide who would rule the world, and Sañjaya predicted that the power would be
transferred to Yudhiṣṭhira. It is also predicted here that Yudhiṣṭhira, after
gaining victory in this battle, would flourish more and more because he was not
only righteous and pious, but he was a strict moralist. He never spoke a lie
during his life.</p>
<p>There are many less intelligent persons who take Bhagavad-gītā to be a
discussion of topics between two friends in a battlefield. But such a book
cannot be scripture. Some may protest that Kṛṣṇa incited Arjuna to fight, which
is immoral, but the reality of the situation is clearly stated: Bhagavad-gītā is
the supreme instruction in morality. The supreme instruction of morality is
stated in the Ninth Chapter, in the thirty-fourth verse: manmanā bhava
mad-bhaktaḥ. One must become a devotee of Kṛṣṇa, and the essence of all religion
is to surrender unto Kṛṣṇa, as stated, Sarva-dharmān. The instructions of
Bhagavad-gītā constitute the supreme process of religion and of morality. All
other processes may be purifying and may lead to this process, but the last
instruction of the Gītā is the last word in all morality and religion: surrender
unto Kṛṣṇa. This is the verdict of the Eighteenth Chapter.</p>
<p>From Bhagavad-gītā we can understand that to realize oneself by philosophical
speculation and by meditation is one process, but to fully surrender unto Kṛṣṇa
is the highest perfection. This is the essence of the teachings of
Bhagavad-gītā. The path of regulative principles according to the orders of
social life and according to the different courses of religion may be a
confidential path of knowledge in as far as the rituals of religion are
confidential, but one is still involved with meditation and cultivation of
knowledge. Surrender unto Kṛṣṇa in devotional service in full Kṛṣṇa
consciousness is the most confidential instruction and is the essence of the
Eighteenth Chapter.</p>
<p>Another feature of Bhagavad-gītā is that the actual truth is the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa. Absolute Truth is realized in three
features—impersonal Brahman, localized Paramātmā, and the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, Kṛṣṇa. Perfect knowledge of the Absolute Truth means perfect knowledge
of Kṛṣṇa. If one understands Kṛṣṇa, then all the departments of knowledge are
part and parcel of that understanding. Kṛṣṇa is transcendental, for He is always
situated in His eternal internal potency. The living entities are manifested and
are divided into two classes, eternally conditioned and eternally liberated.
Such living entities are innumerable, and they are considered fundamental parts
of Kṛṣṇa. Material energy is manifested into twenty-four divisions. The creation
is effected by eternal time, and it is created and dissolved by external energy.
This manifestation of the cosmic world repeatedly becomes visible and invisible.</p>
<p>In Bhagavad-gītā five principal subject matters have been discussed: the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, material nature, the living entities, eternal time and
all kinds of activities. All of these are dependant on the Supreme Personality
of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa. All conceptions of the Absolute Truth, namely, impersonal
Brahman, localized Paramātmā, or any other transcendental conception, exist
within the category of understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
Although superficially the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the living entity,
material nature and time appear to be different, nothing is different from the
Supreme. But the Supreme is always different from everything. Lord Caitanya’s
philosophy is that of “inconceivably one and different.” This system of
philosophy constitutes perfect knowledge of the Absolute Truth.</p>
<p>The living entity in his original position is pure spirit. He is just like an
atomic particle of the Supreme Spirit. The conditioned living entity, however,
is the marginal energy of the Lord; he tends to be in contact with both the
material energy and the spiritual energy. In other words, the living entity is
situated between the two energies of the Lord, and because he belongs to the
superior energy of the Lord, he has a particle of independence. By proper use of
that independence he comes under the direct order of Kṛṣṇa. Thus he attains his
normal condition in the pleasure-giving potency.</p>
