<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The Blessed Lord said: Fearlessness, purification of one’s existence,
cultivation of spiritual knowledge, charity, self-control, performance of
sacrifice, study of the Vedas, austerity and simplicity; nonviolence,
truthfulness, freedom from anger; renunciation, tranquility, aversion to
faultfinding, compassion and freedom from covetousness; gentleness, modesty and
steady determination; vigor, forgiveness, fortitude, cleanliness, freedom from
envy and the passion for honor—these transcendental qualities, O son of Bharata,
belong to godly men endowed with divine nature.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In the beginning of the Fifteenth Chapter, the banyan tree of this material
world was explained. The extra roots coming out of it were compared to the
activities of the living entities, some auspicious, some inauspicious. In the
Ninth Chapter, also, the devas, or godly, and the asuras, the ungodly, or
demons, were explained. Now, according to Vedic rites, activities in the mode of
goodness are considered auspicious for progress on the path of liberation, and
such activities are known as deva prakṛti, transcendental by nature. Those who
are situated in the transcendental nature make progress on the path of
liberation. For those who are acting in the modes of passion and ignorance, on
the other hand, there is no possibility of liberation. Either they will have to</p>
<p>remain in this material world as human beings, or they will descend among the
species of animals or even lower life forms. In this Sixteenth Chapter the Lord
explains both the transcendental nature and its attendant qualities, as well as
the demoniac nature and its qualities. He also explains the advantages and
disadvantages of these qualities.</p>
<p>The word abhijātasya in reference to one born of transcendental qualities or
godly tendencies is very significant. To beget a child in a godly atmosphere is
known in the Vedic scriptures as Garbhādhāna-saṁskāra. If the parents want a
child in the godly qualities they should follow the ten principles of the human
being. In Bhagavad-gītā we have studied also before that sex life for begetting
a good child is Kṛṣṇa Himself. Sex life is not condemned provided the process is
used in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Those who are in Kṛṣṇa consciousness at least
should not beget children like cats and dogs but should beget them so they may
become Kṛṣṇa conscious after birth. That should be the advantage of children
born of a father or mother absorbed in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</p>
<p>The social institution known as varṇāśrama-dharma—the institution dividing
society into four divisions or castes—is not meant to divide human society
according to birth. Such divisions are in terms of educational qualifications.
They are to keep the society in a state of peace and prosperity. The qualities
mentioned herein are explained as transcendental qualities meant for making a
person progress in spiritual understanding so he can get liberated from the
material world. In the varṇāśrama institution the sannyāsī, or the person in the
renounced order of life, is considered to be the head or the spiritual master of
all the social statuses and orders. A brāhmaṇa is considered to be the spiritual
master of the three other sections of a society, namely, the kṣatriyas, the
vaiśyas and the śūdras, but a sannyāsī, who is on the top of the institution, is
considered to be the spiritual master of the brāhmaṇas also. For a sannyāsī, the
first qualification should be fearlessness. Because a sannyāsī has to be alone
without any support or guarantee of support, he has simply to depend on the
mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If he thinks, “After leaving my
connections, who will protect me?” he should not accept the renounced order of
life. One must be fully convinced that Kṛṣṇa or the Supreme Personality of
Godhead in His localized aspect as Paramātmā is always within, that He is seeing
everything and He always knows what one intends to do. One must thus have firm
conviction that Kṛṣṇa as Paramātmā will take care of a soul surrendered to Him.
“I shall never be alone,” one should think. “Even if I live in the darkest
regions of a forest I shall be accompanied by Kṛṣṇa, and He will give me all
protection.” That conviction is called abhayam, without fear. This state of mind
is necessary for a person in the renounced order of life. Then he has to purify
his existence. There are so many rules and regulations to be followed in the
renounced order of life. Most important of all, a sannyāsī is strictly forbidden
to have any intimate relationship with a woman. He is even forbidden to talk
with a woman in a secluded place. Lord Caitanya was an ideal sannyāsī, and when
He was at Purī His feminine devotees could not even come near to offer their
respects. They were advised to bow down from a distant place. This is not a sign
of hatred for women as a class, but it is a stricture imposed on the sannyāsī
not to have close connections with women. One has to follow the rules and
regulations of a particular status of life in order to purify his existence. For
a sannyāsī, intimate relations with women and possessions of wealth for sense
gratification are strictly forbidden. The ideal sannyāsī was Lord Caitanya
Himself, and we can learn from His life that He was very strict in regards to
women. Although He is considered to be the most liberal incarnation of Godhead,
accepting the most fallen conditioned souls, He strictly followed the rules and
regulations of the sannyāsa order of the life in connection with association
with woman. One of His personal associates, namely Choṭa Haridāsa, was
personally associated with Lord Caitanya, along with His other confidential
personal associates, but somehow or other this Choṭa Haridāsa looked lustily on
a young woman, and Lord Caitanya was so strict that He at once rejected him from
the society of His personal associates. Lord Caitanya said, “For a sannyāsī or
anyone who is aspiring to get out of the clutches of material nature and trying
to elevate himself to the spiritual nature and go back to home, back to Godhead,
for him, looking toward material possessions and women for sense
gratification—not even enjoying them, but just looking toward them with such a
propensity—is so condemned that he had better commit suicide before experiencing
such illicit desires.” So these are the processes for purification.</p>
<p>The next item is jñāna-yoga-vyavasthitiḥ: being engaged in the cultivation of
knowledge. Sannyāsī life is meant for distributing knowledge to the householders
and others who have forgotten their real life of spiritual advancement. A
sannyāsī is supposed to beg from door to door for his livelihood, but this does
not mean that he is a beggar. Humility is also one of the qualifications of a
transcendentally situated person, and out of sheer humility the sannyāsī goes
from door to door, not exactly for the purpose of begging, but to see the
householders and awaken them to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. This is the duty of a
sannyāsī. If he is actually advanced and so ordered by his spiritual master, he
should preach Kṛṣṇa with logic and understanding, and if he is not so advanced
he should not accept the renounced order of life. But even if he has accepted
the renounced order of life without sufficient knowledge, he should engage
himself fully in hearing from a bona fide spiritual master to cultivate
knowledge. A sannyāsī or one in the renounced order of life must be situated in
fearlessness, sattva-saṁśuddhiḥ (purity) and jñāna-yoga (knowledge).</p>
<p>The next item is charity. Charity is meant for the householders. The
householders should earn a livelihood by an honorable means and spend fifty
percent of their income to propagate Kṛṣṇa consciousness all over the world.
Thus a householder should give in charity to such institutional societies that
are engaged in that way. Charity should be given to the right receiver. There
are different kinds of charities, as will be explained later on, charity in the
modes of goodness, passion and ignorance. Charity in the mode of goodness is
recommended by the scriptures, but charity in the modes of passion and ignorance
is not recommended because it is simply a waste of money. Charity should be
given only to propagate Kṛsna consciousness all over the world. That is charity
in the mode of goodness.</p>
<p>Then as far as damaḥ (self-control) is concerned, it is not only meant for other
orders of religious society, but it is especially meant for the householder.
Although he has a wife, a householder should not use his senses for sex life
unnecessarily. There are restrictions for the householders even in sex life,
which should only be engaged in for the propagation of children. If he does not
require children, he should not enjoy sex life with his wife. Modern society
enjoys sex life with contraceptive methods or more abominable methods to avoid
the responsibility of children. This is not in the transcendental quality but is
demoniac. If anyone, even if he is a householder, wants to make progress in
spiritual life, he must control his sex life and should not beget a child
without the purpose of serving Kṛṣṇa. If he is able to beget children who will
be in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, one can produce hundreds of children, but without
this capacity one should not indulge only for sense pleasure.</p>
<p>Sacrifice is another item to be performed by the householders because sacrifices
require a large amount of money. Other orders of life, namely the brahmacarya,
the vānaprastha and sannyāsa, have no money; they live by begging. So
performance of different types of sacrifice is meant for the householder. They
should perform agni-hotra sacrifices as enjoined in the Vedic literature, but
such sacrifices at the present moment are very expensive, and it is not possible
for any householder to perform them. The best sacrifice recommended in this age
is called saṅkīrtana-yajña, the chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa,
Hare Hare/Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare. This is the best and most
inexpensive sacrifice; everyone can adopt it and derive benefit. So these three
items, namely charity, sense control and performance of sacrifice, are meant for
the householder.</p>
<p>Then svādhyāyaḥ, Vedic study, and tapas, austerity, and ārjavam, gentleness or
simplicity, are meant for the brahmacarya or student life. Brahmacārīs should
have no connection with women; they should live a life of celibacy and engage
the mind in the study of Vedic literature for cultivation of spiritual
knowledge. This is called svādhyāyaḥ. Tapas or austerity is especially meant for
the retired life. One should not remain a householder throughout his whole life;
he must always remember that there are four divisions of life, brahmacarya,
gṛhastha, vānaprastha and sannyāsa. So after gṛhastha, householder life, one
should retire. If one lives for a hundred years, he should spend twenty-five
years in student life, twenty-five in householder life, twenty-five in retired
life and twenty-five in the renounced order of life. These are the regulations
of the Vedic religious discipline. A man retired from household life must
practice austerities of the body, mind and tongue. That is tapasyā. The entire
varṇāśrama-dharma society is meant for tapasyā. Without tapasyā or austerity no
human being can get liberation. The theory that there is no need of austerity in
life, that one can go on speculating and everything will be nice, is neither
recommended in the Vedic literature nor in Bhagavad-gītā. Such theories are
manufactured by showbottle spiritualists who are trying to gather more
followers. If there are restrictions, rules and regulations, people will not
become attracted. Therefore those who want followers in the name of religion,
just to have a show only, don’t restrict the lives of their students nor their
own lives. But that method is not approved by the Vedas.</p>
<p>As far as simplicity is concerned, not only should a particular order of life
follow this principle, but every member, be he in the brahmacarya-āśrama, or
gṛhastha-āśrama or vānaprastha-āśrama. One must live very simply.</p>
<p>Ahiṁsā means not arresting the progressive life of any living entity. One should
not think that since the spirit spark is never killed even after the killing of
the body there is no harm in killing animals for sense gratification. People are
now addicted to eating animals, in spite of having an ample supply of grains,
fruits and milk. There is no necessity for animal killing. This injunction is
for everyone. When there is no other alternative, one may kill an animal, but it
should be offered in sacrifice. At any rate, when there is an ample food supply
for humanity, persons who are desiring to make advancement in spiritual
realization should not commit violence to animals. Real ahiṁsā means not
checking anyone’s progressive life. The animals are also making progress in
their evolutionary life by transmigrating from one category of animal life to
another. If a particular animal is killed, then his progress is checked. If an
animal is staying in a particular body for so many days or so many years and is
untimely killed, then he has to come back again in that form of life to complete
the remaining days in order to be promoted to another species of life. So their
progress should not be checked simply to satisfy one’s palate. This is called
ahiṁsā.</p>
<p>Satyam. This word means that one should not distort the truth for some personal
interest. In Vedic literature there are some difficult passages, but the meaning
or the purpose should be learned from a bona fide spiritual master. That is the
process for understanding Vedas. Śruti means that one should hear from the
authority. One should not construe some interpretation for his personal
interest. There are so many commentaries on Bhagavad-gītā that misinterpret the
original text. The real import of the word should be presented, and that should
be learned from a bona fide spiritual master.</p>
<p>Akrodhaḥ means to check anger. Even if there is provocation one should be
tolerant, for once one becomes angry his whole body becomes polluted. Anger is
the product of the modes of passion and lust, so one who is transcendentally
situated should check himself from anger. Apaiśunam means that one should not
find fault with others or correct them unnecessarily. Of course to call a thief
a thief is not faultfinding, but to call an honest person a thief is very much
offensive for one who is making advancement in spiritual life. Hrīḥ means that
one should be very modest and must not perform some act which is abominable.
Acāpalam, determination, means that one should not be agitated or frustrated in
some attempt. There may be failure in some attempt, but one should not be sorry
for that; he should make progress with patience and determination. The word
tejaḥ used here is meant for the kṣatriyas. The kṣatriyas should always be very
strong to be able to give protection to the weak. They should not pose
themselves as nonviolent. If violence is required, they must exhibit it.</p>
<p>Śaucam means cleanliness, not only in mind and body but in one’s dealings also.
It is especially meant for the mercantile people, who should not deal in the
black market. Nātimānitā, not expecting honor, applies to the śūdras, the worker
class, which are considered, according to Vedic injunctions, to be the lowest of
the four classes. They should not be puffed up with unnecessary prestige or
honor and should remain in their own status. It is the duty of the śūdras to
offer respect to the higher class for the upkeep of the social order.</p>
<p>All these sixteen qualifications mentioned are transcendental qualities. They
should be cultivated according to the different statuses of the social order.
The purport is that even though material conditions are miserable, if these
qualities are developed by practice, by all classes of men, then gradually it is
possible to rise to the highest platform of transcendental realization.</p>

<p>In this verse, the royal road to hell is described. The demoniac want to make a
show of religion and advancement in spiritual science, although they do not
follow the principles. They are always arrogant or proud in possessing some type
of education or so much wealth. They desire to be worshiped by others, and
demand respectability, although they do not command respect. Over trifles they
become very angry and speak harshly, not gently. They do not know what should be
done and what should not be done. They do everything whimsically, according to
their own desire, and they do not recognize any authority. These demoniac
qualities are taken on by them from the beginning of their bodies in the wombs
of their mothers, and as they grow they manifest all these inauspicious
qualities.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Lord Kṛṣṇa encouraged Arjuna by telling him that he was not born with demoniac
qualities. His involvement in the fight was not demoniac because he was
considering the pro’s and con’s. He was considering whether respectable persons
such as Bhīṣma and Droṇa should be killed or not, so he was not acting under the
influence of anger, false prestige, or harshness. Therefore he was not of the
quality of the demons. For a kṣatriya, a military man, shooting arrows at the
enemy is considered transcendental, and refraining from such a duty is demoniac.
Therefore, there was no cause for Arjuna to lament. Anyone who performs the
regulated principles of the different orders of life is transcendentally
situated.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Lord Kṛṣṇa, having assured Arjuna that he was born with the divine qualities, is
now describing the demoniac way. The conditioned living entities are divided
into two classes in this world. Those who are born with divine qualities follow
a regulated life; that is to say they abide by the injunctions in scriptures and
by the authorities. One should perform duties in the light of authoritative
scripture. This mentality is called divine. One who does not follow the
regulative principles as they are laid down in the scriptures and who acts
according to his whims is called demoniac or asuric. There is no other criterion
but obedience to the regulative principles of scriptures. It is mentioned in
Vedic literature that both the demigods and the demons are born of the
Prajāpati; the only difference is that one class obeys the Vedic injunctions and
the other does not.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Those who are demoniac do not know what is to be done and what is not to be

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In every civilized human society there is some set of scriptural rules and
regulations which are followed from the beginning, especially among the Āryans,
those who adopt the Vedic civilization and who are known as the most advanced
civilized peoples. Those who do not follow the scriptural injunctions are
supposed to be demons. Therefore it is stated here that the demons do not know
the scriptural rules, nor do they have any inclination to follow them. Most of
them do not know them, and even if some of them know, they have not the tendency
to follow them. They have no faith, nor are they willing to act in terms of the
Vedic injunctions. The demons are not clean, either externally or internally.</p>
<p>One should always be careful to keep his body clean by bathing, brushing teeth,
changing clothes, etc. As far as internal cleanliness is concerned, one should
always remember the holy names of God and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa
Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare. The demons neither
like nor follow all these rules for external and internal cleanliness.</p>
<p>As for behavior, there are many rules and regulations guiding human behavior,
such as the Manu-saṁhitā, which is the law of the human race. Even up to today,
those who are Hindu follow the Manu-saṁhitā. Laws of inheritance and other
legalities are derived from this book. Now, in the Manu-saṁhitā, it is clearly
stated that a woman should not be given freedom. That does not mean that women
are to be kept as slaves, but they are like children. Children are not given
freedom, but that does not mean that they are kept as slaves. The demons have
now neglected such injunctions, and they think that women should be given as
much freedom as men. However, this has not improved the social condition of the
world. Actually, a woman should be given protection at every stage of life. She
should be given protection by the father in her younger days, by the husband in
her youth, and by the grownup sons in her old age. This is proper social
behavior according to the Manu-saṁhitā. But modern education has artificially
devised a puffed up concept of womanly life, and therefore marriage is
practically now an imagination in human society. Nor is the moral condition of
woman very good now. The demons, therefore, do not accept any instruction which
is good for society, and because they do not follow the experience of great
sages and the rules and regulations laid down by the sages, the social condition
of the demoniac people is very miserable.</p>

<p>They say that this world is unreal, that there is no foundation and that there

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The demoniac conclude that the world is phantasmagoria. There is no cause, no
effect, no controller, no purpose: everything is unreal. They say that this
cosmic manifestation arises due to chance material actions and reactions. They
do not think that the world was created by God for a certain purpose. They have
their own theory: that the world has come about in its own way and that there is
no reason to believe that there is a God behind it. For them there is no
difference between spirit and matter, and they do not accept the Supreme Spirit.
Everything is matter only, and the whole cosmos is supposed to be a mass of
ignorance. According to them, everything is void, and whatever manifestation
exists is due to our ignorance in perception. They take it for granted that all
manifestation of diversity is a display of ignorance. Just as in a dream we may
create so many things, which actually have no existence, so when we are awake we
shall see that everything is simply a dream. But factually, although the demons
say that life is a dream, they are very expert in enjoying this dream. And so,
instead of acquiring knowledge, they become more and more implicated in their
dreamland. They conclude that as a child is simply the result of sexual
intercourse between man and woman, this world is born without any soul. For them
it is only a combination of matter that has produced the living entities, and
there is no question of the existence of the soul. As many living creatures come
out from perspiration and from a dead body without any cause, similarly, the
whole living world has come out of the material combinations of the cosmic
manifestation. Therefore material nature is the cause of this manifestation, and
there is no other cause. They do not believe in the words of Kṛṣṇa in
Bhagavad-gītā: mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ sūyate sa-carācaram. “Under My direction
the whole material world is moving.” In other words, amongst the demons there is
no perfect knowledge of the creation of this world; every one of them has some
particular theory of his own. According to them, one interpretation of the
scriptures is as good as another, for they do not believe in a standard
understanding of the scriptural injunctions.</p>

<p>The demoniac are engaged in activities that will lead the world to destruction.
The Lord states here that they are less intelligent. The materialists, who have
no concept of God, think that they are advancing. But, according to
Bhagavad-gītā, they are unintelligent and devoid of all sense. They try to enjoy
this material world to the utmost limit and therefore always engage in inventing
something for sense gratification. Such materialistic inventions are considered
to be advancement of human civilization, but the result is that people grow more
and more violent and more and more cruel, cruel to animals and cruel to other
human beings. They have no idea how to behave toward one another. Animal killing
is very prominent amongst demoniac people. Such people are considered the
enemies of the world because ultimately they will invent or create something
which will bring destruction to all. Indirectly, this verse anticipates the
invention of nuclear weapons, of which the whole world is today very proud. At
any moment war may take place, and these atomic weapons may create havoc. Such
things are created solely for the destruction of the world, and this is
indicated here. Due to godlessness, such weapons are invented in human society;
they are not meant for the peace and prosperity of the world.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The demoniac, taking shelter of insatiable lust, pride and false prestige, and
being thus illusioned, are always sworn to unclean work, attracted by the
impermanent.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The demoniac mentality is described here. The demons’ lust is never satiated.
They will go on increasing and increasing their insatiable desires for material
enjoyment. Although they are always full of anxieties on account of accepting
nonpermanent things, they still continue to engage in such activities out of
illusion. They have no knowledge and cannot tell that they are heading the wrong
way. Accepting nonpermanent things, such demoniac people create their own God,
create their own hymns and chant accordingly. The result is that they become
more and more attracted to two things—sex enjoyment and accumulation of material
wealth. The word aśuci-vratāḥ, unclean vow, is very significant in this
connection. Such demoniac people are only attracted by wine, women, gambling and
meat eating; those are their aśuci, unclean habits. Induced by pride and false
prestige, they create some principles of religion which are not approved by the
Vedic injunctions. Although such demoniac people are most abominable in the
world, still, by artificial means, the world creates a false honor for them.
Although they are gliding toward hell, they consider themselves very much
advanced.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>They believe that to gratify the senses unto the end of life is the prime
necessity of human civilization. Thus there is no end to their anxiety. Being
bound by hundreds and thousands of desires, by lust and anger, they secure money
by illegal means for sense gratification.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The demoniac accept that the enjoyment of the senses is the ultimate goal of
life, and this concept they maintain until death. They do not believe in life
after death, and they do not believe that one takes on different types of bodies
according to one’s karma, or activities in this world. Their plans for life are
never finished, and they go on preparing plan after plan, all of which are never
finished. We have personal experience of a person of such demoniac mentality,
who, even at the point of death, was requesting the physician to prolong his
life for four years more because his plans were not yet complete. Such foolish
people do not know that a physician cannot prolong life even for a moment. When
the notice is there, there is no consideration of the man’s desire. The laws of
nature do not allow a second beyond what one is destined to enjoy.</p>
<p>The demoniac person, who has no faith in God or the Supersoul within himself,
performs all kinds of sinful activities simply for sense gratification. He does
not know that there is a witness sitting within his heart. The Supersoul is
observing the activities of the individual soul. As it is stated in the Vedic
literature, the Upaniṣads, there are two birds sitting in one tree; the one is
acting and enjoying or suffering the fruits of the branches, and the other is
witnessing. But one who is demoniac has no knowledge of Vedic scripture, nor has
he any faith; therefore he feels free to do anything for sense enjoyment,
regardless of the consequences.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Thus perplexed by various anxieties and bound by a network of illusions, one
becomes too strongly attached to sense enjoyment and falls down into hell.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The demoniac man knows no limit to his desire to acquire money. That is
unlimited. He only thinks how much assessment he has just now and schemes to
engage that stock of wealth farther and farther. For that reason, he does not
hesitate to act in any sinful way and so deals in the black market for illegal
gratification. He is enamoured by the possessions he has already, such as land,
family, house and bank balance, and he is always planning to improve them. He
believes in his own strength, and he does not know that whatever he is gaining
is due to his past good deeds. He is given an opportunity to accumulate such
things, but he has no conception of past causes. He simply thinks that all his
mass of wealth is due to his own endeavor. A demoniac person believes in the
strength of his personal work, not in the law of karma. According to the law of
karma, a man takes his birth in a high family, or becomes rich, or very well
educated, or very beautiful because of good work in the past. The demoniac
thinks that all these things are accidental and due to the strength of his
personal ability. He does not sense any arrangement behind all the varieties of
people, beauty, and education. Anyone who comes into competition with such a
demoniac man is his enemy. There are many demoniac people, and each is enemy to
the others. This enmity becomes more and more deep—between persons, then between
families, then between societies, and at last between nations. Therefore there
is constant strife, war and enmity all over the world.</p>
<p>Each demoniac person thinks that he can live at the sacrifice of all others.
Generally, a demoniac person thinks of himself as the Supreme God, and a
demoniac preacher tells his followers: “Why are you seeking God elsewhere? You
are all yourselves God! Whatever you like, you can do. Don’t believe in God.
Throw away God. God is dead.” These are the demoniac’s preachings.</p>
<p>Although the demoniac person sees others equally rich and influential, or even
more so, he thinks that no one is richer than him and that no one is more
influential than him. As far as promotion to the higher planetary system is
concerned, he does not believe in performing yajñas or sacrifices. Demons think
that they will manufacture their own process of yajña and prepare some machine,
by which they will be able to reach any higher planet. The best example of such
a demoniac man was Rāvaṇa. He offered a program to the people by which he would
prepare a staircase so that anyone could reach the heavenly planets without
performing sacrifices, such as are prescribed in the Vedas. Similarly, in the
present age such demoniac men are striving to reach the higher planetary systems
by mechanical arrangement. These are examples of bewilderment. The result is
that, without their knowledge, they are gliding toward hell. Here the Sanskrit
word mohajāla is very significant. Jāla means net; like fishes caught in a net,
they have no way to come out.</p>

<p>Thinking themselves all in all, not caring for any authority or scripture, the
demoniac sometimes perform so-called religious or sacrificial rites. And since
they do not believe in authority, they are very impudent. This is due to
illusion caused by accumulating some wealth and false prestige. Sometimes such
demons take up the role of preacher, mislead the people, and become known as
religious reformers or as incarnations of God. They make a show of performing
sacrifices, or they worship the demigods, or manufacture their own God. Common
men advertise them as God and worship them, and by the foolish they are
considered advanced in the principles of religion, or in the principles of
spiritual knowledge. They take the dress of the renounced order of life and
engage in all nonsense in that dress. Actually there are so many restrictions
for one who has renounced this world. The demons, however, do not care for such
restrictions. They think that whatever path one can create is one’s own path;
there is no such thing as a standard path one has to follow. The word
avidhi-pūrvakam, meaning disregard for the rules and regulations, is especially
stressed here. These things are always due to ignorance and illusion.</p>

<p>A demoniac person, being always against God’s supremacy, does not like to
believe in the scriptures. He is envious of both the scriptures and of the
existence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is caused by his so-called
prestige and his accumulation of wealth and strength. He does not know that the
present life is a preparation for the next life. Not knowing this, he is
actually envious of his own self, as well as of others. He commits violence on
other bodies and on his own. He does not care for the supreme control of the
Personality of Godhead because he has no knowledge. Being envious of the
scriptures and the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he puts forward false
arguments against the existence of God and refutes the scriptural authority. He
thinks himself independant and powerful in every action. He thinks that since no
one can equal him in strength, power, or in wealth, he can act in any way and no
one can stop him. If he has an enemy who might check the advancement of his
sensual activities, he makes plans to cut him down by his own power.</p>

<p>In this verse it is clearly indicated that the placing of a particular
individual soul in a particular body is the prerogative of the supreme will. The
demoniac person may not agree to accept the supremacy of the Lord, and it is a
fact that he may act according to his own whims, but his next birth will depend
upon the decision of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and not on himself. In
the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, Third Canto, it is stated that an individual soul, after
his death, is put into the womb of a mother where he gets a particular type of
body under the supervision of superior power. Therefore in the material
existence we find so many species of life—animals, insects, men, and so on. All
are arranged by the superior power. They are not accidental. As for the
demoniac, it is clearly said here that they are perpetually put into the wombs
of demons, and thus they continue to be envious, the lowest of mankind. Such
demoniac species of life are held to be always full of lust, always violent and
hateful and always unclean. They are just like so many beasts in a jungle.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>It is known that God is all-merciful, but here we find that God is never
merciful to the demoniac. It is clearly stated that the demoniac people, life
after life, are put into the wombs of similar demons, and, not achieving the
mercy of the Supreme Lord, they go down and down, so that at last they achieve
bodies like those of cats, dogs and hogs. It is clearly stated that such demons
have practically no chance of receiving the mercy of God at any stage of later
life. In the Vedas also it is stated that such persons gradually sink to become
dogs and hogs. It may be then argued in this connection that God should not be
advertised as all-merciful if He is not merciful to such demons. In answer to
this question, in the Vedānta-sūtra we find that the Supreme Lord has no hatred
for anyone. The placing of the asuras, the demons, in the lowest status of life
is simply another feature of His mercy. Sometimes the asuras are killed by the
Supreme Lord, but this killing is also good for them, for in Vedic literature we
find that anyone who is killed by the Supreme Lord becomes liberated. There are
instances in history of many asuras—Rāvaṇa, Kaṁsa, Hiraṇyakaśipu—to whom the
Lord appeared in various incarnations just to kill. Therefore God’s mercy is
shown to the asuras if they are fortunate enough to be killed by Him.</p>

<p>The man who has escaped these three gates of hell, O son of Kuntī, performs acts

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>One should be very careful of these three enemies to human life: lust, anger,
and greed. The more a person is freed from lust, anger and greed, the more his
existence becomes pure. Then he can follow the rules and regulations enjoined in
the Vedic literature. By following the regulative principles of human life, one
gradually raises himself to the platform of spiritual realization. If one is so
fortunate, by such practice, to rise to the platform of Kṛṣṇa consciousness,
then success is guaranteed for him. In the Vedic literature, the ways of action
and reaction are prescribed to enable one to come to the stage of purification.
The whole method is based on giving up lust, greed and anger. By cultivating
knowledge of this process, one can be elevated to the highest position of
self-realization; this self-realization is perfected in devotional service. In
that devotional service, the liberation of the conditioned soul is guaranteed.
Therefore, according to the Vedic system, there are instituted the four orders
of life and the four statuses of life, called the caste system and the spiritual
order system. There are different rules and regulations for different castes or
divisions of society, and if a person is able to follow them, he will be
automatically raised to the highest platform of spiritual realization. Then he
can have liberation without a doubt.</p>

<p>But he who discards scriptural injunctions and acts according to his own whims

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>As described before, the śāstra-vidhim, or the direction of the śāstra, is given
to the different castes and orders of human society. Everyone is expected to
follow these rules and regulations. If one does not follow them and acts
whimsically according to his lust, greed and desire, then he never will be
perfect in his life. In other words, a man may theoretically know all these
things, but if he does not apply them in his own life, then he is to be known as
the lowest of mankind. In the human form of life, a living entity is expected to
be sane and to follow the regulations given for elevating his life to the
highest platform, but if he does not follow them, then he degrades himself. But
even if he follows the rules and regulations and moral principles and ultimately
does not come to the stage of understanding the Supreme Lord, then all his
knowledge becomes spoiled. Therefore one should gradually raise himself to the
platform of Kṛṣṇa consciousness and devotional service; it is then and there
that he can attain the highest perfectional stage, not otherwise.</p>
<p>The word kāma-cārataḥ is very significant. A person who knowingly violates the
rules acts in lust. He knows that this is forbidden, still he acts. This is
called acting whimsically. He knows that this should be done, but still he does
not do it; therefore he is called whimsical. Such persons are destined to be
condemned by the Supreme Lord. Such persons cannot have the perfection which is
meant for the human life. The human life is especially meant for purifying one’s
existence, and one who does not follow the rules and regulations cannot purify
himself, nor can he attain the real stage of happiness.</p>

<p>One should understand what is duty and what is not duty by the regulations of
the scriptures. Knowing such rules and regulations, one should act so that he
may gradually be elevated.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>As stated in the Fifteenth Chapter, all the rules and regulations of the Vedas
are meant for knowing Kṛṣṇa. If one understands Krsṇa from the Bhagavad-gītā and
becomes situated in Krsṇa consciousness, engaging himself in devotional service,
he has reached the highest perfection of knowledge offered by the Vedic
literature. Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu made this process very easy: He asked
people simply to chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare
Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare and to engage in the devotional service of
the Lord and eat the remnants of foodstuff offered to the Deity. One who is
directly engaged in all these devotional activities is to be understood as
having studied all Vedic literature. He has come to the conclusion perfectly. Of
course, for the ordinary persons who are not in Krsṇa consciousness or who are
not engaged in devotional service, what is to be done and what is not to be done
must be decided by the injunctions of the Vedas. One should act accordingly,
without argument. That is called following the principles of śāstra, or
scripture. Śāstra is without the four principal defects that are visible in the
conditioned soul: imperfect senses, the propensity for cheating, certainty of
committing mistakes, and certainty of being illusioned. These four principal
defects in conditioned life disqualify one from putting forth rules and
regulations. Therefore, the rules and regulations as described in the
śāstra—being above these defects—are accepted without alteration by all great
saints, ācāryas, and great souls.</p>
<p>In India there are many parties of spiritual understanding, generally classified
as two: the impersonalist and the personalist. Both of them, however, lead their
lives according to the principles of the Vedas. Without following the principles
of the scriptures, one cannot elevate himself to the perfectional stage. One who
actually, therefore, understands the purport of the śāstras is considered
fortunate.</p>
<p>In human society, aversion to the principles of understanding the Supreme
Personality of Godhead is the cause of all falldowns. That is the greatest
offense of human life. Therefore, māyā, the material energy of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, is always giving us trouble in the shape of the
threefold miseries. This material energy is constituted of the three modes of
material nature. One has to raise himself at least to the mode of goodness
before the path to understanding the Supreme Lord can be opened. Without raising
oneself to the standard of the mode of goodness, one remains in ignorance and
passion, which are the cause of demoniac life. Those in the modes of passion and
ignorance deride the scriptures, deride the holy man, and deride the proper
understanding of the spiritual master, and they do not care for the regulations
of the scriptures. In spite of hearing the glories of devotional service, they
are not attracted. Thus they manufacture their own way of elevation. These are
some of the defects of human society, which lead to the demoniac status of life.
If, however, one is able to be guided by a proper and bona fide spiritual
master, who can lead one to the path of elevation, to the higher stage, then
one’s life becomes successful.</p>
