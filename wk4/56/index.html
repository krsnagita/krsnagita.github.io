      <p>the conditional state of material existence, he is to be considered liberated.
Similarly, we shall find in the Bhagavad-gītā, Tenth Chapter, that anyone who is
engaged in that way is a liberated person.</p>
<p>Now this first verse has specific significance. Knowledge (idaṁ jñānam) refers
to pure devotional service, which consists of nine different activities:
hearing, chanting, remembering, serving, worshiping, praying, obeying,
maintaining friendship and surrendering everything. By the practice of these
nine elements of devotional service one is elevated to spiritual consciousness,
Kṛṣṇa consciousness. At the time when one’s heart is cleared of the material
contamination, one can understand this science of Kṛṣṇa. Simply to understand
that a living entity is not material is not sufficient. That may be the
beginning of spiritual realization, but one should recognize the difference
between activities of the body and spiritual activities by which one understands
that he is not the body.</p>
<p>In the Seventh Chapter we have already discussed the opulent potency of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, His different energies, the inferior and
superior natures, and all this material manifestation. Now in Chapters Nine and
Ten the glories of the Lord will be delineated.</p>
<p>The Sanskrit word anasūyave in this verse is also very significant. Generally
the commentators, even if they are highly scholarly, are all envious of Kṛṣṇa,
the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Even the most erudite scholars write on
Bhagavad-gītā very inaccurately. Because they are envious of Kṛṣṇa, their
commentaries are useless. The commentaries given by devotees of the Lord are
bona fide. No one can explain Bhagavad-gītā, or give perfect knowledge of Kṛṣṇa
if he is envious. One who criticizes the character of Kṛṣṇa without knowing Him
is a fool. So such commentaries should be very carefully avoided. For one who
understands that Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the pure and
transcendental Personality, these chapters will be very beneficial.</p>

<p>TRANSLATION</p>
<p>This knowledge is the king of education, the most secret of all secrets. It is
the purest knowledge, and because it gives direct perception of the self by
realization, it is the perfection of religion. It is everlasting, and it is
joyfully performed.</p>
<p>PURPORT</p>
<p>This chapter of Bhagavad-gītā is called the king of education because it is the
essence of all doctrines and philosophies explained before. There are seven
principal philosophers in India: Gautama, Kaṇāda, Kapila, Yājñavalkya, Śāṇḍilya,
Vaiśvānara, and, finally, Vyāsadeva, the author of the Vedānta-sūtra. So there
is no dearth of knowledge in the field of philosophy or transcendental
knowledge. Now the Lord says that this Ninth Chapter is the king of all such
knowledge, the essence of all knowledge that can be derived from the study of
the Vedas and different kinds of philosophy. It is the most confidential because
confidential or transcendental knowledge involves understanding the difference
between the soul and the body. And the king of all confidential knowledge
culminates in devotional service.</p>
<p>Generally, people are not educated in this confidential knowledge; they are
educated in external knowledge. As far as ordinary education is concerned,
people are involved with so many departments: politics, sociology, physics,
chemistry, mathematics, astronomy, engineering, etc. There are so many
departments of knowledge all over the world and many huge universities, but
there is, unfortunately, no university or educational institution where the
science of the spirit soul is instructed. Yet the soul is the most important
part of this body; without the presence of the soul, the body has no value.
Still people are placing great stress on the bodily necessities of life, not
caring for the vital soul.</p>
<p>The Bhagavad-gītā, especially from the Second Chapter on, stresses the
importance of the soul. In the very beginning, the Lord says that this body is
perishable and that the soul is not perishable. That is a confidential part of
knowledge: simply knowing that spirit soul is different from this body and that
its nature is immutable, indestructible and eternal. But that gives no positive
information about the soul. Sometimes people are under the impression that the
soul is different from the body and that when the body is finished, or one is
liberated from the body, the soul remains in a void and becomes impersonal. But
actually that is not the fact. How can the soul, which is so active within this
body, be inactive after being liberated from the body? It is always active. If
it is eternal, then it is eternally active, and its activities in the spiritual
kingdom are the most confidential part of spiritual knowledge. These activities
of the spirit soul are therefore indicated here as constituting the king of all
knowledge, the most confidential part of all knowledge.</p>
<p>This knowledge is the purest form of all activities, as is explained in Vedic
literature. In the Padma Purāṇa, man’s sinful activities have been analyzed and
are shown to be the results of sin after sin. Those who are engaged in fruitive
activities are entangled in different stages and forms of sinful reactions. For
instance, when the seed of a particular tree is sown, the tree does not appear
immediately to grow; it takes some time. It is first a small, sprouting plant,
then it assumes the form of a tree, then it flowers, bears fruit, and, when it
is complete, the flowers and fruits are enjoyed by persons who have sown the
seed of the tree. Similarly, a man performs a sinful act, and like a seed it
takes time to fructify. There are different stages. The sinful action may have
already stopped within the individual, but the results or the fruit of that
sinful action are still enjoyed. There are sins which are still in the form of a
seed, and there are others which are already fructified and are giving us fruit,
which we are enjoying as distress and pain, as explained in the twentieth verse
of the Seventh Chapter.</p>
<p>A person who has completely ended the reactions of all sinful activities and who
is fully engaged in pious activities, being freed from the duality of this
material world, becomes engaged in devotional service to the Supreme Personality
of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa. In other words, those who are actually engaged in the
devotional service of the Supreme Lord are already freed from all reactions. For
those who are engaged in the devotional service of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, all sinful reactions, whether fructified, in the stock, or in the form
of a seed, gradually vanish. Therefore the purifying potency of devotional
service is very strong, and it is called pavitram uttamam, the purest. Uttamam
means transcendental. Tamas means this material world or darkness, and uttamam
means that which is transcendental to material activities. Devotional activities
are never to be considered material, although sometimes it appears that devotees
are engaged just like ordinary men. One who can see and is familiar with
devotional service, however, will know that they are not material activities.
They are all spiritual and devotional, uncontaminated by the material modes of
nature.</p>
<p>It is said that the execution of devotional service is so perfect that one can
perceive the results directly. This direct result is actually perceived, and we
have practical experience that any person who is chanting the holy names of
Kṛṣṇa (Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma,
Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare) in course of time feels some transcendental pleasure and
very quickly becomes purified of all material contamination. This is actually
seen. Furthermore, if one engages not only in hearing but in trying to broadcast
the message of devotional activities as well, or if he engages himself in
helping the missionary activities of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he gradually feels
spiritual progress. This advancement in spiritual life does not depend on any
kind of previous education or qualification. The method itself is so pure that
by simply engaging in it one becomes pure.</p>
<p>In the Vedānta-sūtra this is also described in the following words: prakāśaś ca
karmaṇy abhyāsāt. “Devotional service is so potent that simply by engaging in
the activities of devotional service, one becomes enlightened without a doubt.”
Nārada, who happened to be the son of a maidservant, had no education, nor was
he born into a high family. But when his mother was engaged in serving great
devotees, Nārada also became engaged, and sometimes, in the absence of his
mother, he would serve the great devotees himself. Nārada personally says, “Once
only, by their permission, I took the remnants of their food, and by so doing
all my sins were at once eradicated. Thus being engaged, I became purified in
heart, and at that time the very nature of the transcendentalist became
attractive to me.” (Bhāg. 1.5.25) Nārada tells his disciple Vyāsadeva that in a
previous life he was engaged as a boy servant of purified devotees during four
months of their stay and that he was intimately associating with them. Sometimes
those sages left remnants of food on their dishes, and the boy, who would wash
their dishes, wanted to taste the remnants. So he asked the great devotees
whether he could eat them, and they gave their permission. Nārada then ate those
remnants and consequently became freed from all sinful reactions. As he went on
eating, he gradually became as purehearted as the sages, and he gradually
developed the same taste. The great devotees relished the taste of unceasing
devotional service of the Lord, hearing, chanting, etc., and by developing the
same taste, Nārada wanted also to hear and chant the glories of the Lord. Thus
by associating with the sages, he developed a great desire for devotional
service. Therefore he quotes from the Vedānta-sūtra (prakāśaś ca karmaṇy
abhyāsāt): If one is engaged simply in the acts of devotional service,
everything is revealed to him automatically, and he can understand. This is
called prakāśaḥ, directly perceived.</p>
<p>Nārada was actually a son of a maidservant. He had no opportunity to go to
school. He was simply assisting his mother, and fortunately his mother rendered
some service to the devotees. The child Nārada also got the opportunity and
simply by association achieved the highest goal of all religions, devotional
service. In the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam it is said that religious people generally do
not know that the highest perfection of religion is the attainment of the stage
of devotional service. Generally Vedic knowledge is required for the
understanding of the path of self-realization. But here, although he was not
educated in the Vedic principle, Nārada acquired the highest results of Vedic
study. This process is so potent that even without performing the religious
process regularly, one can be raised to the highest perfection. How is this
possible? This is also confirmed in Vedic literature: ācāryavān puruṣo veda. One
who is in association with great ācāryas, even if he is not educated or has not
studied the Vedas, can become familiar with all the knowledge necessary for
realization.</p>
<p>The process of devotional service is a very happy one. Why? Devotional service
consists of śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ, so one can simply hear the chanting of the
glories of the Lord or can attend philosophical lectures on transcendental
knowledge given by authorized ācāryas. Simply by sitting, one can learn; then
one can eat the remnants of the food offered to God, nice palatable dishes. In
every state devotional service is joyful. One can execute devotional service
even in the most poverty-stricken condition. The Lord says, patraṁ puṣpaṁ
phalam: He is ready to accept from the devotee any kind of offering, never mind
what. Even a leaf, a flower, a bit of fruit, or a little water, which are all
available in every part of the world, can be offered by any person, regardless
of social position, and will be accepted if offered with love. There are many
instances in history. Simply by tasting the tulasī leaves offered to the lotus
feet of the Lord, great sages like Sanatkumāra became great devotees. Therefore
the devotional process is very nice, and it can be executed in a happy mood. God
accepts only the love with which things are offered to Him.</p>
<p>It is said here that this devotional service is eternally existing. It is not as
the Māyāvādī philosophers claim. They sometimes take to so-called devotional
service, and as long as they are not liberated they continue their devotional
service, but at the end, when they become liberated, they “become one with God.”
Such temporary time-serving devotional service is not accepted as pure
devotional service. Actual devotional service continues even after liberation.
When the devotee goes to the spiritual planet in the kingdom of God, he is also
engaged there in serving the Supreme Lord. He does not try to become one with
the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>As it will be seen, actual devotional service begins after liberation. So in
Bhagavad-gītā it is said, brahma-bhūta. After being liberated, or being situated
in the Brahman position, one’s devotional service begins. By executing
devotional service, one can understand the Supreme Lord. No one can understand
the Supreme Personality of Godhead by executing karma-yoga, jñāna, or
aṣṭāṅga-yoga or any other yoga independantly. Without coming to the stage of
devotional service, one cannot understand what is the Personality of Godhead. In
the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam it is also confirmed that when one becomes purified by
executing the process of devotional service, especially by hearing
Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam or Bhagavad-gītā from realized souls, then he can understand
the science of Kṛṣṇa or the science of God. Evaṁ prasanna-manaso
bhagavad-bhakti-yogataḥ. When one’s heart is cleared of all nonsense, then one
can understand what God is. Thus the process of devotional service, of Kṛṣṇa
consciousness, is the king of all education and the king of all confidential
knowledge. It is the purest form of religion, and it can be executed joyfully
without difficulty. Therefore one should adopt it.</p>

<p>TRANSLATION</p>
<p>Those who are not faithful on the path of devotional service cannot attain Me, O
conqueror of foes, but return to birth and death in this material world.</p>
<p>PURPORT</p>
<p>The faithless cannot accomplish this process of devotional service; that is the
purport of this verse. Faith is created by association with devotees.
Unfortunate people, even after hearing all the evidence of Vedic literature from
great personalities, still have no faith in God. They are hesitant and cannot
stay fixed in the devotional service of the Lord. Thus faith is a most important
factor for progress in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. In the Caitanya-caritāmṛta it is
said that one should have complete conviction that simply by serving the Supreme
Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa he can achieve all perfection. That is called real faith. In the
Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam (3.4.12) it is stated that by giving water to the root of a
tree, its branches, twigs and leaves become satisfied, and by supplying food to
the stomach all the senses of the body become satisfied, and, similarly, by
engaging in the transcendental service of the Supreme Lord, all the demigods and
all the living entities automatically become satisfied.</p>
<p>After reading Bhagavad-gītā one should promptly come to the conclusion of
Bhagavad-gītā: one should give up all other engagements and adopt the service of
the Supreme Lord, Kṛṣṇa, the Personality of Godhead. If one is convinced of this
philosophy of life, that is faith. Now the development of that faith is the
process of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</p>
<p>There are three divisions of Kṛṣṇa conscious men. In the third class are those
who have no faith. If they are engaged in devotional service officially, for
some ulterior purpose, they cannot achieve the highest perfectional stage. Most
probably they will slip, after some time. They may become engaged, but because
they haven’t complete conviction and faith, it is very difficult for them to
continue in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. We have practical experience in discharging our
missionary activity that some people come and apply themselves to the Kṛṣṇa
consciousness with some hidden motive, and as soon as they are economically a
little well-situated, they give up this process and take to their old ways
again. It is only by faith that one can advance in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. As far
as the development of faith is concerned, one who is well versed in the
literatures of devotional service and has attained the stage of firm faith is
called a first-class person in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. And in the second class are
those who are not very advanced in understanding the devotional scriptures but
who automatically have firm faith that Kṛṣṇa bhakti or service to Kṛṣṇa is the
best course and so in good faith have taken it up. Thus they are superior to the
third class who have neither perfect knowledge of the scriptures nor good faith
but by association and simplicity are trying to follow. The third-class person
in Kṛṣṇa consciousness may fall down, but when one is in the second class or
first class, he does not fall down. One in the first class will surely make
progress and achieve the result at the end. As far as the third-class person in
Kṛṣṇa consciousness is concerned, although he has faith in the conviction that
devotional service to Kṛṣṇa is very good, he has no knowledge of Kṛṣṇa through
the scriptures like Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam and Bhagavad-gītā. Sometimes these
third-class persons in Kṛṣṇa consciousness have some tendency toward karma-yoga
and jñāna-yoga, and sometimes they are disturbed, but as soon as the infection
of karma-yoga or jñāna-yoga is vanquished, they become second-class or
first-class persons in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Faith in Kṛṣṇa is also divided into
three stages and described in Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. First-class attachment,
second-class attachment, and third-class attachment are also explained in
Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam in the Eleventh Canto. Those who have no faith even after
hearing about Kṛṣṇa and the excellence of devotional service, who think that it
is simply eulogy, find the path very difficult, even if they are supposedly
engaged in devotional service. For them there is very little hope in gaining
perfection. Thus faith is very important in the discharge of devotional service.</p>
