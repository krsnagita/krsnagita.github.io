<p>TRANSLATION</p>
<p>Thus the field of activities [the body], knowledge, and the knowable have been
summarily described by Me. Only My devotees can understand this thoroughly and
thus attain to My nature.</p>
<p>PURPORT</p>
<p>The Lord has described in summary the body, knowledge and the knowable. This
knowledge is of three things: the knower, the knowable and the process of
knowing. Combined, these are called vijñānam, or the science of knowledge.
Perfect knowledge can be understood by the unalloyed devotees of the Lord
directly. Others are unable to understand. The monists say that at the ultimate
stage these three items become one, but the devotees do not accept this.
Knowledge and development of knowledge mean understanding oneself in Kṛṣṇa
consciousness. We are being led by material consciousness, but as soon as we
transfer all consciousness to Kṛṣṇa’s activities and realize that Kṛṣṇa is
everything, then we attain real knowledge. In other words, knowledge is nothing
but the preliminary stage of understanding devotional service perfectly.</p>

<p>TRANSLATION</p>
<p>Material nature and the living entities should be understood to be
beginningless. Their transformations and the modes of matter are products of
material nature.</p>
<p>PURPORT</p>
<p>By this knowledge, the body, the field of activities and the knowers of the body
(both the individual soul and the Supersoul) can be known. The body is the field
of activity and is composed of material nature. It is the individual soul which
is embodied. Enjoying the activities of the body is the puruṣa, or the living
entity. He is one knower, and the other is the Supersoul. Of course, it is to be
understood that both the Supersoul and the individual entity are different
manifestations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The living entity is in
the category of His energy, and the Supersoul is in the category of His personal
expansion.</p>
<p>Both material nature and the living entity are eternal. That is to say that they
existed before the creation. The material manifestation is from the energy of
the Supreme Lord and so also are the living entities, but they are of the
superior energy. Both of them existed before this cosmos was manifested.
Material nature was absorbed in the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Mahā-Visṇu,
and when it was required, it was manifested by the agency of mahat-tattva.
Similarly, the living entities are also in Him, and because they are
conditioned, they are adverse to serving the Supreme Lord. Thus they are not
allowed to enter into the spiritual sky. After the winding up of material
nature, these living entities are again given a chance to act in the material
world and prepare themselves to enter into the spiritual world. That is the
mystery of this material creation. Actually the living entity is originally the
spiritual part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, but due to his rebellious nature,
he is conditioned within material nature. It really does not matter how these
living entities or superior entities of the Supreme Lord have come in contact
with material nature. The Supreme Personality of Godhead knows, however, how and
why this actually took place. In the scriptures the Lord says that those
attracted by this material nature are undergoing a hard struggle for existence.
But we should know it with certainty from the descriptions of these few verses
that all the transformations and influences of material nature by the three
modes are also productions of material nature. All transformations and variety
in respect to living entities are due to the body. As far as spirit is
concerned, living entities are all the same.</p>

<p>TRANSLATION</p>
<p>Nature is said to be the cause of all material activities and effects, whereas
the living entity is the cause of the various sufferings and enjoyments in this
world.</p>
<p>PURPORT</p>
<p>The different manifestations of body and senses among the living entities are
due to material nature. There are 8,400,000 different species of life, and these
varieties are the creation of the material nature. They arise from the different
sensual pleasures of the 1iving entity, who thus desires to live in this body or
that. When he is put into different bodies, he enjoys different kinds of
happiness and distress. His material happiness and distress are due to his body,
and not to himself as he is. In his original state there is no doubt of
enjoyment; therefore that is his real state. Because of the desire to lord it
over material nature, he is in the material world. In the spiritual world there
is no such thing. The spiritual world is pure, but in the material world
everyone is struggling hard to acquire victims who present different pleasures
to the body. It might be more clear to state that this body is the effect of the
senses. The senses are instruments for gratifying desire. Now, the sum
total—body and instrument senses—are offered by material nature, and, as will be
clear in the next verse, the living entity is blessed or damned with
circumstances according to his past desire and activity. According to one’s
desires and activities, material nature places one in various residential
quarters. The being himself is the cause of his attaining such residential
quarters and his attendant enjoyment or suffering. Once placed in some
particular kind of body, he comes under the control of nature because the body,
being matter, acts according to the laws of nature. At that time, the 1iving
entity has no power to change that law. Suppose an entity is put into the body
of a dog. As soon as he is put into the body of a dog, he must act like a dog.
He cannot act otherwise. And if the living entity is put into the body of a hog,
then he is forced to eat stool and act like a hog. Similarly, if the living
entity is put into the body of a demigod, he must act according to his body.
This is the law of nature. But in all circumstances, the Supersoul is with the
individual soul. That is explained in the Vedas as follows: dvā suparṇā sayujā
sakhāyā. The Supreme Lord is so kind upon the living entity that He always
accompanies the individual soul and in all circumstances is present as the
Supersoul or Paramātmā.</p>

<p>TRANSLATION</p>
<p>The living entity in material nature thus follows the ways of life, enjoying the
three modes of nature. This is due to his association with that material nature.
Thus he meets with good and evil amongst various species.</p>
<p>PURPORT</p>
<p>This verse is very important for an understanding of how the living entities
transmigrate from one body to another. It is explained in the Second Chapter
that the living entity is transmigrating from one body to another just as one
changes dress. This change of dress is due to his attachment to material
existence. As long as he is captivated by this false manifestation, he has to
continue transmigrating from one body to another. Due to his desire to lord it
over material nature, he is put into such undesirable circumstances. Under the
influence of material desire, the entity is born sometimes as a demigod,
sometimes as a man, sometimes as a beast, as a bird, as a worm, as an aquatic,
as a saintly man, as a bug. This is going on. And in all cases the living entity
thinks himself to be the master of his circumstances, yet he is under the
influence of material nature.</p>
<p>How he is put into such different bodies is explained here. It is due to
association with the different modes of nature. One has to rise, therefore,
above the three material modes and become situated in the transcendental
position. That is called Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Unless one is situated in Kṛṣṇa
consciousness, his material consciousness will oblige him to transfer from one
body to another because he has material desires since time immemorial. But he
has to change that conception. That change can be effected only by hearing from
authoritative sources. The best example is here: Arjuna is hearing the science
of God from Kṛṣṇa. The living entity, if he submits to this hearing process,
will lose his long-cherished desire to dominate material nature, and gradually
and proportionately, as he reduces his long desire to dominate, he comes to
enjoy spiritual happiness. In a Vedic mantra it is said that as he becomes
learned in association with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he
proportionately relishes his eternal blissful life.</p>

<p>TRANSLATION</p>
<p>Yet in this body there is another, a transcendental enjoyer who is the Lord, the
supreme proprietor, who exists as the overseer and permitter, and who is known
as the Supersoul.</p>
<p>PURPORT</p>
<p>It is stated here that the Supersoul, who is always with the individual soul, is
the representation of the Supreme Lord. He is not an ordinary living entity.
Because the monist philosophers take the knower of the body to be one, they
think that there is no difference between the Supersoul and the individual soul.
To clarify this, the Lord says that He is the representation of Paramātmā in
every body. He is different from the individual soul; He is paraḥ,
transcendental. The individual soul enjoys the activities of a particular field,
but the Supersoul is present not as finite enjoyer nor as one taking part in
bodily activities, but as the witness, overseer, permitter and supreme enjoyer.
His name is Paramātmā, not ātmā, and He is transcendental. It is distinctly
clear that the ātmā and Paramātmā are different. The Supersoul, the Paramātmā,
has legs and hands everywhere, but the individual soul does not. And because He
is the Supreme Lord, He is present within to sanction the individual soul’s
desiring material enjoyment. Without the sanction of the Supreme Soul, the
individual soul cannot do anything. The individual is bhakta or the sustained,
and He is bhukta or the maintainer. There are innumerable living entities, and
He is staying in them as a friend.</p>
<p>The fact is that individual living entities are eternally part and parcel of the
Supreme Lord, and both of them are very intimately related as friends. But the
living entity has the tendency to reject the sanction of the Supreme Lord and
act independantly in an attempt to dominate the supreme nature, and because he
has this tendency, he is called the marginal energy of the Supreme Lord. The
living entity can be situated either in the material energy or the spiritual
energy. As long as he is conditioned by the material energy, the Supreme Lord,
as his friend, the Supersoul, stays with him just to get him to return to the
spiritual energy. The Lord is always eager to take him back to the spiritual
energy, but due to his minute independence, the individual entity is continually
rejecting the association of spiritual light. This misuse of independence is the
cause of his material strife in the conditioned nature. The Lord, therefore, is
always giving instruction from within and from without. From without He gives
instructions as stated in Bhagavad-gītā, and from within He tries to convince
him that his activities in the material field are not conducive to real
happiness. “Just give it up and turn your faith toward Me. Then you will be
happy,” He says. Thus the intelligent person who places his faith in the
Paramātmā or the Supreme Personality of Godhead begins to advance toward a
blissful eternal life of knowledge</p>

<p>TRANSLATION</p>
<p>One who understands this philosophy concerning material nature, the living
entity and the interaction of the modes of nature is sure to attain liberation.
He will not take birth here again, regardless of his present position.</p>
<p>PURPORT</p>
<p>Clear understanding of material nature, the Supersoul, the individual soul and
their interrelation makes one eligible to become liberated and turn to the
spiritual atmosphere without being forced to return to this material nature.
This is the result of knowledge. The purpose of knowledge is to understand
distinctly that the living entity has by chance fallen into this material
existence. By his personal endeavor in association with authorities, saintly
persons and a spiritual master, he has to understand his position and then
revert to spiritual consciousness or Kṛṣṇa consciousness by understanding
Bhagavad-gītā as it is explained by the Personality of Godhead. Then it is
certain that he will never come again into this material existence; he will be
transferred into the spiritual world for a blissful eternal life of knowledge.</p>
