<p>TRANSLATION</p>
<p>Humility, pridelessness, nonviolence, tolerance, simplicity, approaching a bona
fide spiritual master, cleanliness, steadiness and self-control; renunciation of
the objects of sense gratification, absence of false ego, the perception of the
evil of birth, death, old age and disease; nonattachment to children, wife, home
and the rest, and evenmindedness amid pleasant and unpleasant events; constant
and unalloyed devotion to Me, resorting to solitary places, detachment from the
general mass of people; accepting the importance of self-realization, and
philosophical search for the Absolute Truth—all these I thus declare to be
knowledge, and what is contrary to these is ignorance.</p>
<p>PURPORT</p>
<p>This process of knowledge is sometimes misunderstood by less intelligent men as
being the interaction of the field of activity. But actually this is the real
process of knowledge. If one accepts this process, then the possibility of
approaching the Absolute Truth exists. This is not the interaction of the
tenfold elements, as described before, This is actually the means to get out of
it. Of all the descriptions of the process of knowledge, the most important
point is described in the first line of the tenth verse: The process of
knowledge terminates in unalloyed devotional service to the Lord. So, if one
does not approach, or is not able to approach, the transcendental service of the
Lord, then the other nineteen items are of no particular value. But, if one
takes to devotional service in full Kṛṣṇa consciousness, the other nineteen
items automatically develop within him. The principle of accepting a spiritual
master, as mentioned in the seventh verse, is essential. Even for one who takes
to devotional service, it is most important. Transcendental life begins when one
accepts a bona fide spiritual master. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Śrī
Kṛṣṇa, clearly states here that this process of knowledge is the actual path.
Anything speculated beyond this is nonsense.</p>
<p>As for the knowledge outlined here, the items may be analyzed as follows:
Humility means that one should not be anxious to have the satisfaction of being
honored by others. The material conception of life makes us very eager to
receive honor from others, but from the point of view of a man in perfect
knowledge—who knows that he is not this body—anything, honor or dishonor,
pertaining to this body is useless. One should not be hankering after this
material deception. People are very anxious to be famous for their religion, and
consequently sometimes it is found that without understanding the principles of
religion, one enters into some group, which is not actually following religious
principles, and then wants to advertise himself as a religious mentor. As for
actual advancement in spiritual science, one should have a test to see how far
he is progressing. He can judge by these items.</p>
<p>Nonviolence is generally taken to mean not killing or destroying the body, but
actually nonviolence means not to put others into distress. People in general
are trapped by ignorance in the material concept of life, and they perpetually
suffer material pains. So, unless one elevates people to spiritual knowledge,
one is practicing violence. One should try his best to distribute real knowledge
to the people, so that they may become enlightened and leave this material
entanglement. That is nonviolence.</p>
<p>Tolerance means that one should be practiced to bear insult and dishonor from
others. If one is engaged in the advancement of spiritual knowledge, there will
be so many insults and much dishonor from others. This is expected because
material nature is so constituted. Even a boy like Prahlāda, who, only five
years old, was engaged in the cultivation of spiritual knowledge, was endangered
when his father became antagonistic to his devotion. The father tried to kill
him in so many ways, but Prahlada tolerated him. So, for making advancement in
spiritual knowledge, there may be many impediments, but we should be tolerant
and continue our progress with determination.</p>
<p>Simplicity means that without diplomacy one should be so straightforward that he
can disclose the real truth even to an enemy. As for acceptance of the spiritual
master, that is essential, because without the instruction of a bona fide
spiritual master, one cannot progress in the spiritual science. One should
approach the spiritual master with all humility and offer him all services so
that he will be pleased to bestow his blessings upon the disciple. Because a
bona fide spiritual master is a representative of Kṛṣṇa, if he bestows any
blessings upon his disciple, that will make the disciple immediately advanced
without the disciple’s following the regulated principles. Or, the regulated
principles will be easier for one who has served the spiritual master without
reservation.</p>
<p>Cleanliness is essential for making advancement in spiritual life. There are two
kinds of cleanliness: external and internal. External cleanliness means taking a
bath, but for internal cleanliness, one has to think of Kṛṣṇa always and chant
Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/Hare Rāma. Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma
Hare Hare. This process cleans the accumulated dust of past karma from the mind.</p>
<p>Steadiness means that one should be very determined to make progress in
spiritual life. Without such determination, one cannot make tangible progress.
And self-control means that one should not accept anything which is detrimental
to the path of spiritual progress. One should become accustomed to this and
reject anything which is against the path of spiritual progress. This is real
renunciation. The senses are so strong that they are always anxious to have
sense gratification. One should not cater to these demands, which are not
necessary. The senses should only be gratified to keep the body fit so that one
can discharge his duty in advancing in spiritual life. The most important and
uncontrollable sense is the tongue. If one can control the tongue, then there is
every possibility of controlling the other senses. The function of the tongue is
to taste and to vibrate. Therefore, by systematic regulation, the tongue should
always be engaged in tasting the remnants of foodstuffs offered to Kṛṣṇa and
chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa. As far as the eyes are concerned, they should not be
allowed to see anything but the beautiful form of Kṛṣṇa. That will control the
eyes. Similarly, the ears should be engaged in hearing about Kṛṣṇa and the nose
in smelling the flowers offered to Kṛṣṇa. This is the process of devotional
service, and it is understood here that Bhagavad-gītā is simply expounding the
science of devotional service. Devotional service is the main and sole
objective. Unintelligent commentators on the Gītā try to divert the mind of the
reader to other subjects, but there is no other subject in Bhagavad-gītā but
devotional service.</p>
<p>False ego means accepting this body as oneself. When one understands that he is
not his body and is spirit soul, that is real ego. Ego is there. False ego is
condemned, but not real ego. In the Vedic literature, it is said: ahaṁ
brahmāsmi. I am Brahman, I am spirit. This “I am,” the sense of self, also
exists in the liberated stage of self-realization. This sense of “I am” is ego,
but when the sense of “I am” is applied to this false body, it is false ego.
When the sense of self is applied to reality, that is real ego. There are some
philosophers who say we should give up our ego, but we cannot give up our ego
because ego means identity. We ought, of course, to give up the false
identification with the body.</p>
<p>One should try to understand the distress of accepting birth, death, old age and
disease. There are descriptions in various Vedic literatures of birth. In the
Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam the world of the unborn, the child’s stay in the womb of the
mother, its suffering, etc., are all very graphically described. It should be
thoroughly understood that birth is distressful. Because we forget how much
distress we have suffered within the womb of the mother, we do not make any
solution to the repetition of birth and death. Similarly at the time of death,
there are all kinds of sufferings, and they are also mentioned in the
authoritative scriptures. These should be discussed. And as far as disease and
old age are concerned, everyone gets practical experience. No one wants to be
diseased, and no one wants to become old, but there is no avoiding these. Unless
we have a pessimistic view of this material life, considering the distresses of
birth, death, old age and disease, there is no impetus for our making
advancement in spiritual life.</p>
<p>As for detachment from children, wife and home, it is not meant that one should
have no feeling for these. They are natural objects of affection, but when they
are not favorable to spiritual progress, then one should not be attached to
them. The best process for making the home pleasant is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. If
one is in full Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he can make his home very happy because this
process of Kṛṣṇa consciousness is very easy. One need only chant Hare Kṛṣṇa,
Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare,
accept the remnants of foodstuffs offered to Kṛṣṇa, have some discussion on
books like Bhagavad-gītā and Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, and engage oneself in Deity
worship. These four will make one happy. One should train the members of his
family in this way. The family members can sit down morning and evening and
chant together Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/Hare Rāma, Hare
Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare. If one can mold his family life in this way to
develop Kṛṣṇa consciousness, following these four principles, then there is no
need to change from family life to renounced life. But if it is not congenial,
not favorable for spiritual advancement, then family life should be abandoned.
One must sacrifice everything to realize or serve Kṛṣṇa, just as Arjuna did.
Arjuna did not want to kill his family members, but when he understood that
these family members were impediments to his Kṛṣṇa realization, he accepted the
instruction of Kṛṣṇa and fought and killed them. In all cases, one should be
detached from the happiness and distress of family life because in this world
one can never be fully happy or fully miserable. Happiness and distress are
concommitant factors of material life. One should learn to tolerate, as advised
in Bhagavad-gītā. One can never restrict the coming and going of happiness and
distress, so one should be detached from the materialistic way of life and be
automatically equiposed in both cases. Generally, when we get something
desirable, we are very happy, and when we get something undesirable, we are
distressed. But if we are actually in the spiritual position, these things will
not agitate us. To reach that stage, we have to practice unbreakable devotional
service; devotional service to Kṛṣṇa without deviation means engaging oneself in
the nine processes of devotional service, chanting, hearing, worshiping,
offering respect, etc., as described in the last verse of the Ninth Chapter.
That process should be followed. Naturally, when one is adapted to the spiritual
way of life, he will not want to mix with materialistic men. That would go
against his grain. One may test himself by seeing how far he is inclined to live
in a solitary place without unwanted association.</p>
<p>Naturally a devotee has no taste for unnecessary sporting or cinema-going or
enjoying some social function, because he understands that these are simply a
waste of time. There are many research scholars and philosophers who study sex
life or some other subject, but according to Bhagavad-gītā, such research work
and philosophical speculation have no value. That is more or less nonsensical.
According to Bhagavad-gītā, one should make research by philosophical discretion
into the nature of the soul. One should make research to understand with what
the self is concerned. That is recommended here.</p>
<p>As far as self-realization is concerned, it is clearly stated here that
bhakti-yoga is especially practical. As soon as there is a question of devotion,
one must consider the relationship between the Supersoul and the individual
soul. The individual soul and the Supersoul cannot be one, at least not in the
bhakti conception, the devotional conception of life. This service of the
individual soul to the Supreme Soul is eternal, nityam, as is clearly stated. So
bhakti or devotional service is eternal. One should be established in that
philosophical conviction, otherwise it is only a waste of time, ignorance.</p>
<p>In the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, this is explained; vadanti tat tattva-vidas tattvaṁ
yaj jñānam advayam. “Those who are actually knowers of the Absolute Truth know
that the Self is realized in three different phases as Brahman, Paramātmā and
Bhagavān.” (Bhāg. 1.2.11) Bhagavān is the last word in the realization of the
Absolute Truth; therefore one should reach up to that platform of understanding
the Supreme Personality of Godhead and thus engage in the devotional service of
the Lord. That is perfection of knowledge.</p>
<p>Beginning from practicing humility up to the point of realization of the Supreme
Truth, the Absolute Personality of Godhead, this process is just like a
staircase beginning from the ground floor up to the top floor. Now on this
staircase there are so many people who have reached the first floor, the second
or third floor, etc., but unless one reaches the top floor, which is the
understanding of Kṛṣṇa, he is at a lower stage of knowledge. If anyone wants to
compete with God and at the same time make advancement in spiritual knowledge,
he will be frustrated. It is clearly stated that without humility understanding
is harmful. To think oneself God is most puffed up. Although the living entity
is always being kicked by the stringent laws of material nature, still he
thinks, “I am God” because of ignorance. One should be humble and know that he
is subordinate to the Supreme Lord. Due to rebellion against the Supreme Lord,
one becomes subordinate to material nature. One must know and be convinced of
this truth.</p></div>
