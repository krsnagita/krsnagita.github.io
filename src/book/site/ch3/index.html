<p>Arjuna said: O Janārdana, O Keśava, why do You urge me to engage in this ghastly
warfare, if You think that intelligence is better than fruitive work?</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead Śrī Kṛṣṇa has very elaborately described the
constitution of the soul in the previous chapter, with a view to deliver His
intimate friend Arjuna from the ocean of material grief. And the path of
realization has been recommended: buddhi-yoga, or Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Sometimes
Kṛṣṇa consciousness is misunderstood to be inertia, and one with such a
misunderstanding often withdraws to a secluded place to become fully Kṛṣṇa
conscious by chanting the holy name of Lord Kṛṣṇa. But without being trained in
the philosophy of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, it is not advisable to chant the holy
name of Kṛṣṇa in a secluded place where one may acquire only cheap adoration
from the innocent public. Arjuna also thought of Kṛṣṇa consciousness or
buddhi-yoga, or intelligence in spiritual advancement of knowledge, as something
like retirement from active life and the practice of penance and austerity at a
secluded place. In other words, he wanted to skillfully avoid the fighting by
using Kṛṣṇa consciousness as an excuse. But as a sincere student, he placed the
matter before his master and questioned Kṛṣṇa as to his best course of action.
In answer, Lord Kṛṣṇa elaborately explained karma-yoga, or work in Kṛṣṇa
consciousness, in this Third Chapter.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>My intelligence is bewildered by Your equivocal instructions. Therefore, please

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In the previous chapter, as a prelude to the Bhagavad-gītā, many different paths
were explained, such as sāṅkhya-yoga, buddhi-yoga, control of the senses by
intelligence, work without fruitive desire, and the position of the neophyte.
This was all presented unsystematically. A more organized outline of the path
would be necessary for action and understanding. Arjuna, therefore, wanted to
clear up these apparently confusing matters so that any common man could accept
them without misinterpretation. Although Kṛṣṇa had no intention of confusing
Arjuna by any jugglery of words, Arjuna could not follow the process of Kṛṣṇa
consciousness—either by inertia or active service. In other words, by his
questions he is clearing the path of Kṛṣṇa consciousness for all students who
seriously want to understand the mystery of the Bhagavad-gītā.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The Blessed Lord said: O sinless Arjuna, I have already explained that there are
two classes of men who realize the Self. Some are inclined to understand Him by
empirical, philosophical speculation, and others are inclined to know Him by
devotional work.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In the Second Chapter, verse 39, the Lord explained two kinds of
procedures—namely sāṅkhya-yoga and karma-yoga, or buddhi-yoga. In this verse,
the Lord explains the same more clearly. Sāṅkhya-yoga, or the analytical study
of the nature of spirit and matter, is the subject matter for persons who are
inclined to speculate and understand things by experimental knowledge and
philosophy. The other class of men work in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, as it is
explained in the 61st verse of the Second Chapter. The Lord has explained, also
in the 39th verse, that by working by the principles of buddhi-yoga, or Kṛṣṇa
consciousness, one can be relieved from the bonds of action; and, furthermore,
there is no flaw in the process. The same principle is more clearly explained in
the 61st verse—that this buddhi-yoga is to depend entirely on the Supreme (or
more specifically, on Kṛṣṇa), and in this way all the senses can be brought
under control very easily. Therefore, both the yogas are interdependant, as
religion and philosophy. Religion without philosophy is sentiment, or sometimes
fanaticism, while philosophy without religion is mental speculation. The
ultimate goal is Kṛṣṇa, because the philosophers who are also sincerely
searching after the Absolute Truth come in the end to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. This
is also stated in the Bhagavad-gītā. The whole process is to understand the real
position of the self in relation to the Superself. The indirect process is
philosophical speculation, by which, gradually, one may come to the point of
Kṛṣṇa consciousness; and the other process is directly connecting with
everything in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Of these two, the path of Kṛṣṇa consciousness
is better because it does not depend on purifying the senses by a philosophical
process. Kṛṣṇa consciousness is itself the purifying process, and by the direct
method of devotional service it is simultaneously easy and sublime.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Not by merely abstaining from work can one achieve freedom from reaction, nor by
renunciation alone can one attain perfection.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The renounced order of life can be accepted upon being purified by the discharge
of the prescribed form of duties which are laid down just to purify the heart of
materialistic men. Without purification, one cannot attain success by abruptly
adopting the fourth order of life (sannyāsa). According to the empirical
philosophers, simply by adopting sannyāsa, or retiring from fruitive activities,
one at once becomes as good as Nārāyaṇa. But Lord Kṛṣṇa does not approve this
principle. Without purification of heart, sannyāsa is simply a disturbance to
the social order. On the other hand, if someone takes to the transcendental
service of the Lord, even without discharging his prescribed duties, whatever he
may be able to advance in the cause is accepted by the Lord (buddhi-yoga).
Svalpam apy asya dharmasya trāyate mahato bhayāt. Even a slight performance of
such a principle enables one to overcome great difficulties.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>All men are forced to act helplessly according to the impulses born of the modes
of material nature; therefore no one can refrain from doing something, not even
for a moment.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>It is not a question of embodied life, but it is the nature of the soul to be
always active. Without the presence of the spirit soul, the material body cannot
move. The body is only a dead vehicle to be worked by the spirit soul, which is
always active and cannot stop even for a moment. As such, the spirit soul has to
be engaged in the good work of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, otherwise it will be engaged
in occupations dictated by illusory energy. In contact with material energy, the
spirit soul acquires material modes, and to purify the soul from such affinities
it is necessary to engage in the prescribed duties enjoined in the śāstras. But
if the soul is engaged in his natural function of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, whatever
he is able to do is good for him. The Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam affirms this:</p>
<p>tyaktvā sva-dharmaṁ caraṇāmbujaṁ harer bhajann apakvo ’tha patet tato yadi yatra
kva vābhadram abhūd amuṣya kiṁ ko vārtha āpto ’bhajatāṁ sva-dharmataḥ.</p>
<p>“If someone takes to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, even though he may not follow the
prescribed duties in the śāstras nor execute the devotional service properly,
and even though he may fall down from the standard, there is no loss or evil for
him. But if he carries out all the injunctions for purification in the śāstras,
what does it avail him if he is not Kṛṣṇa conscious?” (Bhāg. 1.5.17) So the
purificatory process is necessary for reaching this point of Kṛṣṇa
consciousness. Therefore, sannyāsa, or any purificatory process, is to help
reach the ultimate goal of becoming Kṛṣṇa conscious, without which everything is
considered a failure.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>One who restrains the senses and organs of action, but whose mind dwells on
sense objects, certainly deludes himself and is called a pretender.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>There are many pretenders who refuse to work in Kṛṣṇa consciousness but make a
show of meditation, while actually dwelling within the mind upon sense
enjoyment. Such pretenders may also speak on dry philosophy in order to bluff
sophisticated followers, but according to this verse these are the greatest
cheaters. For sense enjoyment one can act in any capacity of the social order,
but if one follows the rules and regulations of his particular status, he can
make gradual progress in purifying his existence. But he who makes a show of
being a yogī, while actually searching for the objects of sense gratification,
must be called the greatest cheater, even though he sometimes speaks of
philosophy. His knowledge has no value because the effects of such a sinful
man’s knowledge are taken away by the illusory energy of the Lord. Such a
pretender’s mind is always impure, and therefore his show of yogic meditation
has no value whatsoever.</p>

<p>On the other hand, he who controls the senses by the mind and engages his active

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Instead of becoming a pseudo-transcendentalist for the sake of wanton living and
sense enjoyment, it is far better to remain in one’s own business and execute
the purpose of life, which is to get free from material bondage and enter into
the kingdom of God. The prime svārtha-gati, or goal of self-interest, is to
reach Viṣṇu. The whole institution of varṇa and āśrama is designed to help us
reach this goal of life. A householder can also reach this destination by
regulated service in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. For self-realization, one can live a
controlled life, as prescribed in the śāstras, and continue carrying out his
business without attachment, and in that way make progress. Such a sincere
person who follows this method is far better situated than the false pretender
who adopts show-bottle spiritualism to cheat the innocent public. A sincere
sweeper in the street is far better than the charlatan meditator who meditates
only for the sake of making a living.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Perform your prescribed duty, for action is better than inaction. A man cannot

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>There are many pseudo-meditators who misrepresent themselves as belonging to
high parentage, and great professional men who falsely pose that they have
sacrificed everything for the sake of advancement in spiritual life. Lord Kṛṣṇa
did not want Arjuna to become a pretender, but that he perform his prescribed
duties as set forth for kṣatriyas. Arjuna was a householder and a military
general, and therefore it was better for him to remain as such and perform his
religious duties as prescribed for the householder kṣatriya. Such activities
gradually cleanse the heart of a mundane man and free him from material
contamination. So-called renunciation for the purpose of maintenance is never
approved by the Lord, nor by any religious scripture. After all, one has to
maintain one’s body and soul together by some work. Work should not be given up
capriciously, without purification of materialistic propensities. Anyone who is
in the material world is certainly possessed of the impure propensity for
lording it over material nature, or, in other words, for sense gratification.
Such polluted propensities have to be cleared. Without doing so, through
prescribed duties, one should never attempt to become a so-called
transcendentalist, renouncing work and living at the cost of others.</p>

to this material world. Therefore, O son of Kuntī, perform your prescribed
duties for His satisfaction, and in that way you will always remain unattached
and free from bondage.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Since one has to work even for the simple maintenance of the body, the
prescribed duties for a particular social position and quality are so made that
that purpose can be fulfilled. Yajña means Lord Viṣṇu, or sacrificial
performances. All sacrificial performances also are meant for the satisfaction
of Lord Viṣṇu. The Vedas enjoin: yajño vai viṣṇuḥ. In other words, the same
purpose is served whether one performs prescribed yajñas or directly serves Lord
Viṣṇu. Kṛṣṇa consciousness is therefore performance of yajña as it is prescribed
in this verse. The varṇāśrama institution also aims at this for satisfying Lord
Viṣṇu. “Varṇāśramācāra-vatā puruṣeṇa paraḥ pumān/viṣṇur ārādhyate…” (Viṣṇu
Purāṇa 3.8.8) Therefore one has to work for the satisfaction of Viṣṇu. Any other
work done in this material world wilI be a cause of bondage, for both good and
evil work have their reactions, and any reaction binds the performer. Therefore,
one has to work in Kṛṣṇa consciousness to satisfy Kṛṣṇa (or Viṣṇu); and while
performing such activities one is in a liberated stage. This is the great art of
doing work, and in the beginning this process requires very expert guidance. One
should therefore act very diligently, under the expert guidance of a devotee of
Lord Kṛṣṇa, or under the direct instruction of Lord Kṛṣṇa Himself (under whom
Arjuna had the opportunity to work). Nothing should be performed for sense
gratification, but everything should be done for the satisfaction of Kṛṣṇa. This
practice will not only save one from the reaction of work, but will also
gradually elevate one to transcendental loving service of the Lord, which alone
can raise one to the kingdom of God.</p>

<p>In the beginning of creation, the Lord of all creatures sent forth generations
of men and demigods, along with sacrifices for Viṣṇu, and blessed them by
saying, “Be thou happy by this yajña [sacrifice] because its performance will
bestow upon you all desirable things.”</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The material creation by the Lord of creatures (Viṣṇu) is a chance offered to
the conditioned souls to come back home—back to Godhead. All living entities
within the material creation are conditioned by material nature because of their
forgetfulness of their relationship to Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. The Vedic principles are to help us understand this eternal relation as
it is stated in the Bhagavad-gītā: vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyaḥ. The Lord
says that the purpose of the Vedas is to understand Him. In the Vedic hymns it
is said: patiṁ viśvasyātmeśvaram. Therefore, the Lord of the living entities is
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Viṣṇu. In the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam also Śrīla
Śukadeva Gosvāmī describes the Lord as pati in so many ways:</p>
<p>śriyaḥ-patir yajña-patiḥ prajā-patir dhiyāṁ patir loka-patir dharā-patiḥ patir
gatiś cāndhaka-vṛṣṇi-sātvatāṁ prasīdatāṁ me bhagavān satāṁ patiḥ</p>
<p>(Bhāg. 2.4.20)</p>
<p>The prajā-pati is Lord Viṣṇu, and He is the Lord of all living creatures, all
worlds, and all beauties, and the protector of everyone. The Lord created this
material world for the conditioned souls to learn how to perform yajñas
(sacrifice) for the satisfaction of Viṣṇu, so that while in the material world
they can live very comfortably without anxiety. Then after finishing the present
material body, they can enter into the kingdom of God. That is the whole program
for the conditioned soul. By performance of yajña, the conditioned souls
gradually become Kṛṣṇa conscious and become godly in all respects. In this age
of Kali, the saṅkīrtana-yajña (the chanting of the names of God) is recommended
by the Vedic scriptures, and this transcendental system was introduced by Lord
Caitanya for the deliverance of all men in this age. Saṅkīrtana-yajña and Kṛṣṇa
consciousness go well together. Lord Kṛṣṇa in His devotional form (as Lord
Caitanya) is mentioned in the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam as follows, with special
reference to the saṅkīrtana-yajña:</p>
<p>kṛṣṇa-varṇaṁ tviṣākṛṣṇāṁ sāṅgopāṅgāstra-pārṣadam yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtana-prāyair
yajanti hi su-medhasaḥ</p>
<p>“In this age of Kali, people who are endowed with sufficient intelligence will
worship the Lord, who is accompanied by His associates, by performance of
saṅkīrtana-yajña.” (Bhāg. 11.5.29) Other yajñas prescribed in the Vedic
literatures are not easy to perform in this age of Kali, but the
saṅkīrtana-yajña is easy and sublime for all purposes.</p>

<p>The demigods, being pleased by sacrifices, will also please you; thus nourishing

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The demigods are empowered administrators of material affairs. The supply of
air, light, water and all other benedictions for maintaining the body and soul
of every living entity are entrusted to the demigods, who are innumerable
assistants in different parts of the body of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
Their pleasures and displeasures are dependant on the performance of yajñas by
the human being. Some of the yajñas are meant to satisfy particular demigods;
but even in so doing, Lord Viṣṇu is worshiped in all yajñas as the chief
beneficiary. It is stated also in the Bhagavad-gītā that Kṛṣṇa Himself is the
beneficiary of all kinds of yajñas: bhoktāraṁ yajña-tapasām. Therefore, ultimate
satisfaction of the yajñapati is the chief purpose of all yajñas. When these
yajñas are perfectly performed, naturally the demigods in charge of the
different departments of supply are pleased, and there is no scarcity in the
supply of natural products.</p>
<p>Performance of yajñas has many side benefits, ultimately leading to liberation
from the material bondage. By performance of yajñas, all activities become
purified, as it is stated in the Vedas:</p>
<p>āhāra-śuddhau sattva-śuddhiḥ sattva-śuddhau dhruvā smṛtiḥ smṛti-lambhe
sarva-granthīnāṁ vipra-mokṣaḥ</p>
<p>As it will be explained in the following verse, by performance of yajña, one’s
eatables become sanctified, and by eating sanctified foodstuffs, one’s very
existence becomes purified; by the purification of existence, finer tissues in
the memory become sanctified, and when memory is sanctified, one can think of
the path of liberation, and all these combined together lead to Kṛṣṇa
consciousness, the great necessity of present-day society.</p>

<p>In charge of the various necessities of life, the demigods, being satisfied by
the performance of yajña [sacrifice], supply all necessities to man. But he who
enjoys these gifts, without offering them to the demigods in return, is
certainly a thief.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The demigods are authorized supplying agents on behalf of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, Viṣṇu. Therefore, they must be satisfied by the
performance of prescribed yajñas. In the Vedas, there are different kinds of
yajñas prescribed for different kinds of demigods, but all are ultimately
offered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. For one who cannot understand
what the Personality of Godhead is, sacrifice to the demigods is recommended.
According to the different material qualities of the persons concerned,
different types of yajñas are recommended in the Vedas. Worship of different
demigods is also on the same basis—namely, according to different qualities. For
example, the meat-eaters are recommended to worship the goddess Kālī, the
ghastly form of material nature, and before the goddess the sacrifice of animals
is recommended. But for those who are in the mode of goodness, the
transcendental worship of Viṣṇu is recommended. But ultimately, all yajñas are
meant for gradual promotion to the transcendental position. For ordinary men, at
least five yajñas, known as pañca-mahāyajña, are necessary.</p>
<p>One should know, however, that all the necessities of life that the human
society requires are supplied by the demigod agents of the Lord. No one can
manufacture anything. Take, for example, all the eatables of human society.
These eatables include grains, fruits, vegetables, milk, sugar, etc., for the
persons in the mode of goodness, and also eatables for the nonvegetarians, like
meats, etc., none of which can be manufactured by men. Then again, take for
example heat, light, water, air, etc., which are also necessities of life—none
of them can be manufactured by the human society. Without the Supreme Lord,
there can be no profuse sunlight, moonlight, rainfall, breeze, etc., without
which no one can live. Obviously, our life is dependant on supplies from the
Lord. Even for our manufacturing enterprises, we require so many raw materials
like metal, sulphur, mercury, manganese, and so many essentials—all of which are
supplied by the agents of the Lord, with the purpose that we should make proper
use of them to keep ourselves fit and healthy for the purpose of
self-realization, leading to the ultimate goal of life, namely, liberation from
the material struggle for existence. This aim of life is attained by performance
of yajñas. If we forget the purpose of human life and simply take supplies from
the agents of the Lord for sense gratification and become more and more
entangled in material existence, which is not the purpose of creation, certainly
we become thieves, and therefore we are punished by the laws of material nature.
A society of thieves can never be happy because they have no aim in life. The
gross materialist thieves have no ultimate goal of life. They are simply
directed to sense gratification; nor do they have knowledge of how to perform
yajñas. Lord Caitanya, however, inaugurated the easiest performance of yajña,
namely the saṅkīrtana-yajña, which can be performed by anyone in the world who
accepts the principles of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</p>

<p>The devotees of the Lord are released from all kinds of sins because they eat

sense enjoyment, verily eat only sin.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The devotees of the Supreme Lord, or the persons who are in Kṛṣṇa consciousness,
are called santas, and they are always in love with the Lord as it is described
in the Brahma-saṁhitā: premāñjana- cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena santaḥ sadaiva
hṛdayeṣu vilokayanti. The santas, being always in a compact of love with the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda (the giver of all pleasures), or Mukunda
(the giver of liberation), or Kṛṣṇa (the all-attractive person), cannot accept
anything without first offering it to the Supreme Person. Therefore, such
devotees always perform yajñas in different modes of devotional service, such as
śravaṇam, kīrtanam, smaraṇam, arcanam, etc., and these performances of yajñas
keep them always aloof from all kinds of contamination of sinful association in
the material world. Others, who prepare food for self or sense gratification,
are not only thieves, but are also the eaters of all kinds of sins. How can a
person be happy if he is both a thief and sinful? It is not possible. Therefore,
in order for people to become happy in all respects, they must be taught to
perform the easy process of saṅkīrtana-yajña, in full Kṛṣṇa consciousness.
Otherwise, there can be no peace or happiness in the world.</p>

<p>All living bodies subsist on food grains, which are produced from rain. Rains

prescribed duties.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa, a great commentator on the Bhagavad-gītā, writes as
follows: ye indrādy-aṅga-tayāvasthitaṁ yajñaṁ sarveśvaraṁ viṣṇum abhyarccya
taccheṣam aśnanti tena taddeha-yāntrāṁ sampādayanti te santaḥ sarveśvarasya
bhaktāḥ sarva-kilviṣair anādi-kāla-vivṛddhair ātmānubhava- pratibandhakair
nikhilaiḥ pāpair vimucyante. The Supreme Lord, who is known as the
yajña-puruṣaḥ, or the personal beneficiary of all sacrifices, is the master of
all demigods who serve Him as the different limbs of the body serve the whole.
Demigods like Indra, Candra, Varuṇa, etc., are appointed officers who manage
material affairs, and the Vedas direct sacrifices to satisfy these demigods so
that they may be pleased to supply air, light and water sufficiently to produce
food grains. When Lord Kṛṣṇa is worshiped, the demigods, who are different limbs
of the Lord, are also automatically worshiped; therefore there is no separate
need to worship the demigods. For this reason, the devotees of the Lord, who are
in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, offer food to Kṛṣṇa and then eat—a process which
nourishes the body spiritually. By such action not only are past sinful
reactions in the body vanquished, but the body becomes immunized to all
contamination of material nature. When there is an epidemic disease, an
antiseptic vaccine protects a person from the attack of such an epidemic.
Similarly, food offered to Lord Viṣṇu and then taken by us makes us sufficiently
resistant to material affection, and one who is accustomed to this practice is
called a devotee of the Lord. Therefore, a person in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, who
eats only food offered to Kṛṣṇa, can counteract all reactions of past material
infections, which are impediments to the progress of self-realization. On the
other hand, one who does not do so continues to increase the volume of sinful
action, and this prepares the next body to resemble hogs and dogs, to suffer the
resultant reactions of all sins. The material world is full of contaminations,
and one who is immunized by accepting prasādam of the Lord (food offered to
Viṣṇu) is saved from the attack, whereas one who does not do so becomes
subjected to contamination.</p>
<p>Food grains or vegetables are factually eatables. The human being eats different
kinds of food grains, vegetables, fruits, etc., and the animals eat the refuse
of the food grains and vegetables, grass, plants, etc. Human beings who are
accustomed to eating meat and flesh must also depend on the production of
vegetation in order to eat the animals. Therefore, ultimately, we have to depend
on the production of the field and not on the production of big factories. The
field production is due to sufficient rain from the sky, and such rains are
controlled by demigods like Indra, sun, moon, etc., and they are all servants of
the Lord. The Lord can be satisfied by sacrifices; therefore, one who cannot
perform them will find himself in scarcity—that is the law of nature. Yajña,
specifically the saṅkīrtana-yajña prescribed for this age, must therefore be
performed to save us at least from scarcity of food supply.</p>

<p>Regulated activities are prescribed in the Vedas, and the Vedas are directly

all-pervading Transcendence is eternally situated in acts of sacrifice.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Yajñārtha karma, or the necessity of work for the satisfaction of Kṛṣṇa only, is
more expressly stated in this verse. If we have to work for the satisfaction of
the yajña-puruṣa, Viṣṇu, then we must find out the direction of work in Brahman,
or the transcendental Vedas. The Vedas are therefore codes of working
directions. Anything performed without the direction of the Vedas is called
vikarma, or unauthorized or sinful work. Therefore, one should always take
direction from the Vedas to be saved from the reaction of work. As one has to
work in ordinary life by the direction of the state, similarly, one has to work
under direction of the supreme state of the Lord. Such directions in the Vedas
are directly manifested from the breathing of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. It is said: asya mahato bhūtasya naśvasitam etad yad ṛg-vedo
yajur-vedaḥ sāma-vedo ’tharvāṅ girasaḥ. “The four Vedas—namely the Ṛg-veda,
Yajur-veda, Sāma-veda and Atharva-veda—are all emanations from the breathing of
the great Personality of Godhead.” The Lord, being omnipotent, can speak by
breathing air, as it is confirmed in the Brahma-saṁhitā, for the Lord has the
omnipotence to perform through each of His senses the actions of all other
senses. In other words, the Lord can speak through His breathing, and He can
impregnate by His eyes. In fact, it is said that He glanced over material nature
and thus fathered all living entities. After creating or impregnating the
conditioned souls into the womb of material nature, He gave His directions in
the Vedic wisdom as to how such conditioned souls can return home, back to
Godhead. We should always remember that the conditioned souls in material nature
are all eager for material enjoyment. But the Vedic directions are so made that
one can satisfy one’s perverted desires, then return to Godhead, having finished
his so-called enjoyment. It is a chance for the conditioned souls to attain
liberation; therefore the conditioned souls must try to follow the process of
yajña by becoming Kṛṣṇa conscious. Even those who cannot follow the Vedic
injunctions may adopt the principles of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and that will take
the place of performance of Vedic yajñas, or karmas.</p>

<p>My dear Arjuna, a man who does not follow this prescribed Vedic system of
sacrifice certainly leads a life of sin, for a person delighting only in the
senses lives in vain.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The mammonist philosophy of work very hard and enjoy sense gratification is
condemned herein by the Lord. Therefore, for those who want to enjoy this
material world, the above-mentioned cycle of performing yajñas is absolutely
necessary. One who does not follow such regulations is living a very risky life,
being condemned more and more. By nature’s law, this human form of life is
specifically meant for self-realization, in either of the three ways—namely
karma-yoga, jñāna-yoga, or bhakti-yoga. There is no necessity of rigidly
following the performances of the prescribed yajñas for the transcendentalists
who are above vice and virtue; but those who are engaged in sense gratification
require purification by the above-mentioned cycle of yajña performances. There
are different kinds of activities. Those who are not Kṛṣṇa conscious are
certainly engaged in sensory consciousness; therefore they need to execute pious
work. The yajña system is planned in such a way that sensory conscious persons
may satisfy their desires without becoming entangled in the reaction of
sense-gratificatory work. The prosperity of the world depends not on our own
efforts but on the background arrangement of the Supreme Lord, directly carried
out by the demigods. Therefore, the yajñas are directly aimed at the particular
demigod mentioned in the Vedas. Indirectly, it is the practice of Kṛṣṇa
consciousness, because when one masters the performance of yajñas, one is sure
to become Kṛṣṇa conscious. But if by performing yajñas one does not become Kṛṣṇa
conscious, such principles are counted as only moral codes. One should not,
therefore, limit his progress only to the point of moral codes, but should
transcend them, to attain Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</p>

thousands of yajña performances. By such clearing of consciousness, one becomes
fully confident of his eternal position in relationship with the Supreme. His
duty thus becomes self-illuminated by the grace of the Lord, and therefore he no
longer has any obligations to the Vedic injunctions. Such a Kṛṣṇa conscious
person is no longer interested in material activities and no longer takes
pleasure in material arrangements like wine, women and similar infatuations.</p>

<p>The Supreme is the Personality of Godhead for the devotees, and liberation for
the impersonalist. A person, therefore, acting for Kṛṣṇa, or in Kṛṣṇa
consciousness, under proper guidance and without attachment to the result of the
work, is certainly making progress toward the supreme goal of life. Arjuna is
told that he should fight in the Battle of Kurukṣetra for the interest of Kṛṣṇa
because Kṛṣṇa wanted him to fight. To be a good man or a nonviolent man is a
personal attachment, but to act on behalf of the Supreme is to act without
attachment for the result. That is perfect action of the highest degree,
recommended by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Śrī Kṛṣṇa. Vedic rituals,
like prescribed sacrifices, are performed for purification of impious activities
that were performed in the field of sense gratification. But action in Kṛṣṇa
consciousness is transcendental to the reactions of good or evil work. A Kṛṣṇa
conscious person has no attachment for the result but acts on behalf of Kṛṣṇa
alone. He engages in all kinds of activities, but is completely nonattached.</p>

of prescribed duties. Therefore, just for the sake of educating the people in
general, you should perform your work.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Kings like Janaka and others were all self-realized souls; consequently they had
no obligation to perform the prescribed duties in the Vedas. Nonetheless they
performed all prescribed activities just to set examples for the people in
general. Janaka was the father of Sītā, and father-in-law of Lord Śrī Rāma.
Being a great devotee of the Lord, he was transcendentally situated, but because
he was the King of Mithila (a subdivision of Behar province in India), he had to
teach his subjects how to fight righteously in battle. He and his subjects
fought to teach people in general that violence is also necessary in a situation
where good arguments fail. Before the Battle of Kurukṣetra, every effort was
made to avoid the war, even by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but the other
party was determined to fight. So for such a right cause, there is a necessity
for fighting. Although one who is situated in Kṛṣṇa consciousness may not have
any interest in the world, he still works to teach the public how to live and
how to act. Experienced persons in Kṛṣṇa consciousness can act in such a way
that others will follow, and this is explained in the following verse.</p>
<h3 id="321">3.21</h3>
<p>yad yad ācarati śreṣṭhas</p>

janaḥ—person; saḥ—he; yat—whichever; pramāṇam—evidence; kurute—does perform;
lokaḥ—all the world; tat—that; anuvartate—follow in the footsteps.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Whatever action is performed by a great man, common men follow in his footsteps.
And whatever standards he sets by exemplary acts, all the world pursues.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>People in general always require a leader who can teach the public by practical
behavior. A leader cannot teach the public to stop smoking if he himself smokes.
Lord Caitanya said that a teacher should behave properly even before he begins
teaching. One who teaches in that way is called ācārya, or the ideal teacher.
Therefore, a teacher must follow the principles of śāśtra (scripture) to reach
the common man. The teacher cannot manufacture rules against the principles of
revealed scriptures. The revealed scriptures, like Manu-saṁhitā and similar
others, are considered the standard books to be followed by human society. Thus
the leader’s teaching should be based on the principles of the standard rules as
they are practiced by the great teachers. The Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam also affirms
that one should follow in the footsteps of great devotees, and that is the way
of progress on the path of spiritual realization. The king or the executive head
of a state, the father and the school teacher are all considered to be natural
leaders of the innocent people in general. All such natural leaders have a great
responsibility to their dependants; therefore they must be conversant with
standard books of moral and spiritual codes.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead is described in the Vedic literatures as
follows:</p>
<p>tam īśvarāṇāṁ paramaṁ maheśvaraṁ taṁ devatānāṁ paramaṁ ca daivatam patiṁ patīnāṁ
paramaṁ parastād vidāma devaṁ bhuvaneśam īḍyam</p>

śaktir vividhaiva śrūyate svā-bhāvikī jñāna-bala-kriyā ca.</p>
<p>“The Supreme Lord is the controller of all other controllers, and He is the
greatest of all the diverse planetary leaders. Everyone is under His control.
All entities are delegated with particular power only by the Supreme Lord; they
are not supreme themselves. He is also worshipable by all demigods and is the
supreme director of all directors. Therefore, He is transcendental to all kinds
of material leaders and controllers and is worshipable by all. There is no one
greater than Him, and He is the supreme cause of all causes.</p>
<p>“He does not possess bodily form like that of an ordinary living entity. There
is no difference between His body and His soul. He is absolute. All His senses
are transcendental. Any one of His senses can perform the action of any other
sense. Therefore, no one is greater than Him or equal to Him. His potencies are
multifarious, and thus His deeds are automatically performed as a natural
sequence.” (Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad 6.7–8)</p>
<p>Since everything is in full opulence in the Personality of Godhead and is
existing in full truth, there is no duty for the Supreme Personality of Godhead
to perform. One who must receive the results of work has some designated duty,
but one who has nothing to achieve within the three planetary systems certainly
has no duty. And yet Lord Kṛṣṇa is engaged on the Battlefield of Kurukṣetra as
the leader of the kṣatriyas because the kṣatriyas are duty-bound to give
protection to the distressed. Although He is above all the regulations of the
revealed scriptures, He does not do anything that violates the revealed
scriptures.</p>

<p>In order to keep the balance of social tranquility for progress in spiritual

Although such rules and regulations are for the conditioned souls and not Lord
Kṛṣṇa, because He descended to establish the principles of religion, He followed
the prescribed rules. Otherwise, common men would follow in His footsteps
because He is the greatest authority. From the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam it is
understood that Lord Kṛṣṇa was performing all the religious duties at home and
out of home, as required of a householder.</p>

<p>If I should cease to work, then all these worlds would be put to ruination. I

destroy the peace of all sentient beings.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Varṇa-saṅkara is unwanted population which disturbs the peace of the general
society. In order to check this social disturbance, there are prescribed rules
and regulations by which the population can automatically become peaceful and
organized for spiritual progress in life. When Lord Kṛṣṇa descends, naturally He
deals with such rules and regulations in order to maintain the prestige and
necessity of such important performances. The Lord is the father of all living
entities, and if the living entities are misguided, indirectly the
responsibility goes to the Lord. Therefore, whenever there is general disregard
of regulative principles, the Lord Himself descends and corrects the society. We
should, however, note carefully that although we have to follow in the footsteps
of the Lord, we still have to remember that we cannot imitate Him. Following and
imitating are not on the same level. We cannot imitate the Lord by lifting
Govardhana Hill, as the Lord did in His childhood. It is impossible for any
human being. We have to follow His instructions, but we may not imitate Him at
any time. The Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam affirms:</p>
<p>naitat samācarej jātu manasāpi hy anīśvaraḥ vinaśyaty ācaran mauḍhyād yathā
’rudro ’bdhijaṁ viṣam</p>
<p>īśvarāṇāṁ vacaḥ satyaṁ tathaivācaritaṁ kvacit teṣāṁ yat sva-vaco yuktaṁ
buddhimāṁs tat samācaret</p>
<p>“One should simply follow the instructions of the Lord and His empowered
servants. Their instructions are all good for us, and any intelligent person
will perform them as instructed. However, one should guard against trying to
imitate their actions. One should not try to drink the ocean of poison in
imitation of Lord Śiva.” (Bhāg. 10.33.30)</p>
<p>We should always consider the position of the īśvaras, or those who can actually
control the movements of the sun and moon, as superior. Without such power, one
cannot imitate the īśvaras, who are superpowerful. Lord Śiva drank poison to the
extent of swallowing an ocean, but if any common man tries to drink even a
fragment of such poison, he will be killed. There are many psuedo-devotees of
Lord Śiva who want to indulge in smoking gāñjā (marijuana) and similar
intoxicating drugs, forgetting that by so imitating the acts of Lord Śiva they
are calling death very near. Similarly, there are some psuedo-devotees of Lord
Kṛṣṇa who prefer to imitate the Lord in His rāsa-līlā, or dance of love,
forgetting their inability to lift Govardhana Hill. It is best, therefore, that
one not try to imitate the powerful, but simply follow their instructions; nor
should one try to occupy their posts without qualification. There are so many
“incarnations” of God without the power of the Supreme Godhead.</p>

activities, but one is engaged in such activities for the satisfaction of his
sense gratification, whereas the other is engaged for the satisfaction of Kṛṣṇa.

<p>Vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyaḥ: that is the end of all Vedic rituals. All
rituals, all performances of sacrifices, and everything that is put into the
Vedas, including all directions for material activities, are meant for
understanding Kṛṣṇa, who is the ultimate goal of life. But because the
conditioned souls do not know anything beyond sense gratification, they study
the Vedas to that end. Through sense regulations, however, one is gradually
elevated to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Therefore a realized soul in Kṛṣṇa
consciousness should not disturb others in their activities or understanding,
but he should act by showing how the results of all work can be dedicated to the
service of Kṛṣṇa. The learned Kṛṣṇa conscious person may act in such a way that
the ignorant person working for sense gratification may learn how to act and how
to behave. Although the ignorant man is not to be disturbed in his activities,
still, a slightly developed Kṛṣṇa conscious person may directly be engaged in
the service of the Lord without waiting for other Vedic formulas. For this
fortunate man there is no need to follow the Vedic rituals, because in direct
Kṛṣṇa consciousness one can have all the results simply by following the
prescribed duties of a particular person.</p>

<p>Two persons, one in Kṛṣṇa consciousness and the other in material consciousness,
working on the same level, may appear to be working on the same platform, but
there is a wide gulf of difference in their respective positions. The person in
material consciousness is convinced by false ego that he is the doer of
everything. He does not know that the mechanism of the body is produced by
material nature, which works under the supervision of the Supreme Lord. The
materialistic person has no knowledge that ultimately he is under the control of
Kṛṣṇa. The person in false ego takes all credit for doing everything
independantly, and that is the symptom of his nescience. He does not know that
this gross and subtle body is the creation of material nature, under the order
of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and as such his bodily and mental
activities should be engaged in the service of Kṛṣṇa, in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.
The ignorant man forgets that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is known as
Hṛṣīkeśa, or the master of the senses of the material body, for due to his long
misuse of the senses in sense gratification, he is factually bewildered by the
false ego, which makes him forget his eternal relationship with Kṛṣṇa.</p>

<p>The knower of the Absolute Truth is convinced of his awkward position in
material association. He knows that he is part and parcel of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, and that his position should not be in the
material creation. He knows his real identity as part and parcel of the Supreme,
who is eternal bliss and knowledge, and he realizes that somehow or other he is
entrapped in the material conception of life. In his pure state of existence he
is meant to dovetail his activities in devotional service to the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa. He therefore engages himself in the activities of
Kṛṣṇa consciousness and becomes naturally unattached to the activities of the
material senses, which are all circumstantial and temporary. He knows that his
material condition of life is under the supreme control of the Lord;
consequently he is not disturbed by all kinds of material reactions, which he
considers to be the mercy of the Lord. According to Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, one who
knows the Absolute Truth in three different features—namely Brahman, Paramātmā,
and the Supreme Personality of Godhead—is called tattvavit, for he knows also
his own factual position in relationship with the Supreme.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Persons who are unknowledgeable falsely identify with gross material
consciousness and are full of material designations. This body is a gift of the
material nature, and one who is too much attached to the bodily consciousness is
called mandān, or a lazy person without understanding of spirit soul. Ignorant
men think of the body as the self; bodily connections with others are accepted
as kinsmanship; the land in which the body is obtained is the object of worship;
and the formalities of religious rituals are considered ends in themselves.
Social work, nationalism, and altruism are some of the activities for such
materially designated persons. Under the spell of such designations, they are
always busy in the material field; for them spiritual realization is a myth, and
so they are not interested. Such bewildered persons may even be engaged in such
primary moral principles of life as nonviolence and similar materially
benevolent work. Those who are, however, enlightened in spiritual life, should
not try to agitate such materially engrossed persons. Better to prosecute one’s
own spiritual activities silently.</p>
<p>Men who are ignorant cannot appreciate activities in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and
therefore Lord Kṛṣṇa advises us not to disturb them and simply waste valuable
time. But the devotees of the Lord are more kind than the Lord because they
understand the purpose of the Lord. Consequently they undertake all kinds of
risks, even to the point of approaching ignorant men to try to engage them in
the acts of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, which are absolutely necessary for the human
being.</p>

<p>Therefore, O Arjuna, surrendering all your works unto Me, with mind intent on
Me, and without desire for gain and free from egoism and lethargy, fight.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>This verse clearly indicates the purpose of the Bhagavad-gītā. The Lord
instructs that one has to become fully Kṛṣṇa conscious to discharge duties, as
if in military discipline. Such an injunction may make things a little
difficult; nevertheless duties must be carried out, with dependence on Kṛṣṇa,
because that is the constitutional position of the living entity. The living
entity cannot be happy independant of the cooperation of the Supreme Lord
because the eternal constitutional position of the living entity is to become
subordinate to the desires of the Lord. Arjuna was, therefore, ordered by Śrī
Kṛṣṇa to fight as if the Lord were his military commander. One has to sacrifice
everything for the good will of the Supreme Lord, and at the same time discharge
prescribed duties without claiming proprietorship. Arjuna did not have to
consider the order of the Lord; he had only to execute His order. The Supreme
Lord is the Soul of all souls; therefore, one who depends solely and wholly on
the Supreme Soul without personal consideration, or in other words, one who is
fully Kṛṣṇa conscious, is called adhyātma-cetasā. Nirāśīḥ means that one has to
act on the order of the master. Nor should one ever expect fruitive results. The
cashier may count millions of dollars for his employer, but he does not claim a
cent for himself. Similarly, one has to realize that nothing in the world
belongs to any individual person, but that everything belongs to the Supreme
Lord. That is the real purport of mayi, or unto Me. And when one acts in such
Kṛṣṇa consciousness, certainly he does not claim proprietorship over anything.
This consciousness is called nirmama, or nothing is mine. And, if there is any
reluctance to execute such a stern order which is without consideration of
so-called kinsmen in the bodily relationship, that reluctance should be thrown
off; in this way one may become vigata-jvara, or without feverish mentality or
lethargy. Everyone, according to his quality and position, has a particular type
of work to discharge, and all such duties may be discharged in Kṛṣṇa
consciousness, as described above. That will lead one to the path of liberation.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The injunction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, is the essence of
all Vedic wisdom, and therefore is eternally true without exception. As the
Vedas are eternal, so this truth of Kṛṣṇa consciousness is also eternal. One
should have firm faith in this injunction, without envying the Lord. There are
many philosophers who write comments on the Bhagavad-gītā but have no faith in
Kṛṣṇa. They will never be liberated from the bondage of fruitive action. But an
ordinary man with firm faith in the eternal injunctions of the Lord, even though
unable to execute such orders, becomes liberated from the bondage of the law of
karma. In the beginning of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, one may not fully discharge the
injunctions of the Lord, but because one is not resentful of this principle and
works sincerely without consideration of defeat and hopelessness, he will surely
be promoted to the stage of pure Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</p>

ignorant of his own self, of the Supreme Brahman, and Paramātmā and the

perfection of life for him.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Unless one is situated on the transcendental platform of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he
cannot get free from the influence of the modes of material nature, as it is
confirmed by the Lord in the Seventh Chapter (7.14). Therefore, even for the
most highly educated person on the mundane plane, it is impossible to get out of
the entanglement of māyā simply by theoretical knowledge, or by separating the
soul from the body. There are many so-called spiritualists who outwardly pose to
be advanced in the science, but inwardly or privately are completely under the
particular modes of nature which they are unable to surpass. Academically, one
may be very learned, but because of his long association with material nature,
he is in bondage. Kṛṣṇa consciousness helps one to get out of the material
entanglement, even though one may be engaged in his prescribed duties.
Therefore, without being fully in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, no one should suddenly
give up his prescribed duties and become a so-called yogī or transcendentalist
artificially. It is better to be situated in one’s position and to try to attain
Kṛṣṇa consciousness under superior training. Thus one may be freed from the
clutches of māyā.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Attraction and repulsion for sense objects are felt by embodied beings, but one
should not fall under the control of senses and sense objects because they are
stumbling blocks on the path of self-realization.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Those who are in Kṛṣṇa consciousness are naturally reluctant to engage in
material sense gratifications. But those who are not in such consciousness
should follow the rules and regulations of the revealed scriptures. Unrestricted
sense enjoyment is the cause of material encagement, but one who follows the
rules and regulations of the revealed scriptures does not become entangled by
the sense objects. For example, sex enjoyment is a necessity for the conditioned
soul, and sex enjoyment is allowed under the license of marriage ties. For
example, according to scriptural injunctions, one is forbidden to engage in sex
relationships with any women other than one’s wife. All other women are to be
considered as one’s mother. But, in spite of such injunctions, a man is still
inclined to have sex relationships with other women. These propensities are to
be curbed; otherwise they will be stumbling blocks on the path of
self-realization. As long as the material body is there, the necessities of the
material body are allowed, but under rules and regulations. And yet, we should
not rely upon the control of such allowances. One has to follow those rules and
regulations, unattached to them, because practice of sense gratifications under
regulations may also lead one to go astray—as much as there is always the chance
of an accident, even on the royal roads. Although they may be very carefully
maintained, no one can guarantee that there will be no danger even on the safest
road. The sense enjoyment spirit has been current a very long, long time, owing
to material association. Therefore, in spite of regulated sense enjoyment, there
is every chance of falling down; therefore any attachment for regulated sense
enjoyment must also be avoided by all means. But action in the loving service of
Kṛṣṇa detaches one from all kinds of sensory activities. Therefore, no one
should try to be detached from Kṛṣṇa consciousness at any stage of life. The
whole purpose of detachment from all kinds of sense attachment is ultimately to
become situated on the platform of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>It is far better to discharge one’s prescribed duties, even though they may be
faulty, than another’s duties. Destruction in the course of performing one’s own
duty is better than engaging in another’s duties, for to follow another’s path
is dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>One should therefore discharge his prescribed duties in full Kṛṣṇa consciousness
rather than those prescribed for others. Prescribed duties complement one’s
psychophysical condition, under the spell of the modes of material nature.
Spiritual duties are as ordered by the spiritual master, for the transcendental
service of Kṛṣṇa. But both materially or spiritually, one should stick to his
prescribed duties even up to death, rather than imitate another’s prescribed
duties. Duties on the spiritual platform and duties on the material platform may
be different, but the principle of following the authorized direction is always
good for the performer. When one is under the spell of the modes of material
nature, one should follow the prescribed rules for particular situations and
should not imitate others. For example, a brāhmaṇa, who is in the mode of
goodness, is nonviolent, whereas a kṣatriya, who is in the mode of passion, is
allowed to be violent. As such, for a kṣatriya it is better to be vanquished
following the rules of violence than to imitate a brāhmaṇa who follows the
principles of nonviolence. Everyone has to cleanse his heart by a gradual
process, not abruptly. However, when one transcends the modes of material nature
and is fully situated in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he can perform anything and
everything under the direction of the bona fide spiritual master. In that
complete stage of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, the kṣatriya may act as a brāhmaṇa, or a
brāhmaṇa may act as a kṣatriya. In the transcendental stage, the distinctions of
the material world do not apply. For example, Viśvāmitra was originally a
kṣatriya, but later on he acted as a brāhmaṇa, whereas Paraśurāma was a
brāhmaṇa, but later on he acted as a kṣatriya. Being transcendentally situated,
they could do so; but as long as one is on the material platform, he must
perform his duties according to the modes of material nature. At the same time,
he must have a full sense of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>A living entity, as part and parcel of the Supreme, is originally spiritual,
pure, and free from all material contaminations. Therefore, by nature he is not
subjected to the sins of the material world. But when he is in contact with the
material nature, he acts in many sinful ways without hesitation, and sometimes
even against his will. As such, Arjuna’s question to Kṛṣṇa is very sanguine, as
to the perverted nature of the living entities. Although the living entity
sometimes does not want to act in sin, he is still forced to act. Sinful actions
are not, however, impelled by the Supersoul within, but are due to another
cause, as the Lord explains in the next verse.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The Blessed Lord said: It is lust only, Arjuna, which is born of contact with
the material modes of passion and later transformed into wrath, and which is the
all-devouring, sinful enemy of this world.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>When a living entity comes in contact with the material creation, his eternal
love for Kṛṣṇa is transformed into lust, in association with the mode of
passion. Or, in other words, the sense of love of God becomes transformed into
lust, as milk in contact with sour tamarind is transformed into yogurt. Then
again, when lust is unsatisfied, it turns into wrath; wrath is transformed into
illusion, and illusion continues the material existence. Therefore, lust is the
greatest enemy of the living entity, and it is lust only which induces the pure
living entity to remain entangled in the material world. Wrath is the
manifestation of the mode of ignorance; these modes exhibit themselves as wrath
and other corollaries. If, therefore, the modes of passion, instead of being
degraded into the modes of ignorance, are elevated to the modes of goodness by
the prescribed method of Iiving and acting, then one can be saved from the
degradation of wrath by spiritual attachment.</p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead expanded Himself into many for His
ever-increasing spiritual bliss, and the living entities are parts and parcels
of this spiritual bliss. They also have partial independence, but by misuse of
their independence, when the service attitude is transformed into the propensity
for sense enjoyment, they come under the sway of lust. This material creation is
created by the Lord to give a facility to the conditioned souls to fulfill these
lustful propensities, and when they are completely baffled by prolonged lustful
activities, the living entities begin to inquire about their real position.</p>
<p>This inquiry is the beginning of the Vedānta-sūtras, wherein it is said, athāto
brahma-jijñāsā: one should inquire into the Supreme. And the Supreme is defined
in Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam as janmādyasya yato ’nvayād itarataś ca, or, “The origin of
everything is the Supreme Brahman.” Therefore, the origin of lust is also in the
Supreme. If, therefore, lust is transformed into love for the Supreme, or
transformed into Kṛṣṇa consciousness—or, in other words, desiring everything for
Kṛṣṇa—then both lust and wrath can be spiritualized. Hanumān, the great servitor
of Lord Rama, engaged his wrath upon his enemies for the satisfaction of the
Lord. Therefore, lust and wrath, when they are employed in Kṛṣṇa consciousness,
become our friends instead of our enemies.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>As fire is covered by smoke, as a mirror is covered by dust, or as the embryo is
covered by the womb, similarly, the living entity is covered by different
degrees of this lust.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>There are three degrees of covering of the living entity by which his pure
consciousness is obscured. This covering is but lust under different
manifestations like smoke in the fire, dust on the mirror, and the womb about
the embryo. When lust is compared to smoke, it is understood that the fire of
the living spark can be a little perceived. In other words, when the living
entity exhibits his Kṛṣṇa consciousness slightly, he may be likened to the fire
covered by smoke. Although fire is necessary where there is smoke, there is no
overt manifestation of fire in the early stage. This stage is like the beginning
of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. The dust on the mirror refers to a cleansing process of
the mirror of the mind by so many spiritual methods. The best process is to
chant the holy names of the Lord. The embryo covered by the womb is an analogy
illustrating a helpless position, for the child in the womb is so helpless that
he cannot even move. This stage of living condition can be compared to that of
the trees. The trees are also living entities, but they have been put in such a
condition of life by such a great exhibition of lust that they are almost void
of all consciousness. The covered mirror is compared to the birds and beasts,
and the smoke covered fire is compared to the human being. In the form of a
human being, the living entity may revive a little Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and, if
he makes further development, the fire of spiritual life can be kindled in the
human form of life. By careful handling of the smoke in the fire, the fire can
be made to blaze. Therefore the human form of life is a chance for the living
entity to escape the entanglement of material existence. In the human form of
life, one can conquer the enemy, lust, by cultivation of Kṛṣṇa consciousness
under able guidance.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Thus, a man’s pure consciousness is covered by his eternal enemy in the form of
lust, which is never satisfied and which burns like fire.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>It is said in the Manu-smṛti that lust cannot be satisfied by any amount of
sense enjoyment, just as fire is never extinguished by a constant supply of
fuel. In the material world, the center of all activities is sex, and thus this
material world is called maithuṇya-āgāra, or the shackles of sex life. In the
ordinary prison house, criminals are kept within bars; similarly, the criminals
who are disobedient to the laws of the Lord are shackled by sex life.
Advancement of material civilization on the basis of sense gratification means
increasing the duration of the material existence of a living entity. Therefore,
this lust is the symbol of ignorance by which the living entity is kept within
the material world. While one enjoys sense gratification, it may be that there
is some feeling of happiness, but actually that so-called feeling of happiness
is the ultimate enemy of the sense enjoyer.</p>

<p>The senses, the mind and the intelligence are the sitting places of this lust,

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The enemy has captured different strategic positions in the body of the
conditioned soul, and therefore Lord Kṛṣṇa is giving hints of those places, so
that one who wants to conquer the enemy may know where he can be found. Mind is
the center of all the activities of the senses, and thus the mind is the
reservoir of all ideas of sense gratification; and, as a result, the mind and
the senses become the repositories of lust. Next, the intelligence department
becomes the capital of such lustful propensities. Intelligence is the immediate
next-door neighbor of the spirit soul. Lusty intelligence influences the spirit
soul to acquire the false ego and identify itself with matter, and thus with the
mind and senses. The spirit soul becomes addicted to enjoying the material
senses and mistakes this as true happiness. This false identification of the
spirit soul is very nicely explained in the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam:</p>
<p>yasyātma-buddhiḥ kuṇāpe tri-dhātuke sva-dhīḥ kalatrādiṣu bhauma idyadhīḥ

<p>“A human being who identifies this body made of three elements with his self,
who considers the by-products of the body to be his kinsmen, who considers the

take a bath rather than meet men of transcendental knowledge there, is to be
considered as an ass or a cow.”</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Therefore, O Arjuna, best of the Bhāratas, in the very beginning curb this great
symbol of sin [lust] by regulating the senses, and slay this destroyer of
knowledge and self-realization.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Lord advised Arjuna to regulate the senses from the very beginning so that
he could curb the greatest sinful enemy, lust, which destroys the urge for
self-realization, and specifically, knowledge of the self. Jñānam refers to
knowledge of self as distinguished from non-self, or, in other words, knowledge
that the spirit soul is not the body. Vijñānam refers to specific knowledge of
the spirit soul and knowledge of one’s constitutional position and his
relationship to the Supreme Soul. It is explained thus in the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam:
jñānaṁ parama-guhyaṁ me yad-vijñāna-samanvitam / sarahasyaṁ tad-aṅgaṁ ca gṛhāna
gaditaṁ mayā: “The knowledge of the self and the Supreme Self is very
confidential and mysterious, being veiled by māyā, but such knowledge and
specific realization can be understood if it is explained by the Lord Himself.”
Bhagavad-gītā gives us that knowledge, specifically knowledge of the self. The
living entities are parts and parcels of the Lord, and therefore they are simply
meant to serve the Lord. This consciousness is called Kṛṣṇa consciousness. So,
from the very beginning of life one has to learn this Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and
thereby one may become fully Kṛṣṇa conscious and act accordingly.</p>
<p>Lust is only the perverted reflection of the love of God which is natural for
every living entity. But if one is educated in Kṛṣṇa consciousness from the very
beginning, that natural love of God cannot deteriorate into lust. When love of
God deteriorates into lust, it is very difficult to return to the normal
condition. Nonetheless, Kṛṣṇa consciousness is so powerful that even a late
beginner can become a lover of God by following the regulative principles of
devotional service. So, from any stage of life, or from the time of
understanding its urgency, one can begin regulating the senses in Kṛṣṇa
consciousness, devotional service of the Lord, and turn the lust into love of
Godhead—the highest perfectional stage of human life.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The working senses are superior to dull matter; mind is higher than the senses;
intelligence is still higher than the mind; and he [the soul] is even higher
than the intelligence.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The senses are different outlets for the activities of lust. Lust is reserved
within the body, but it is given vent through the senses. Therefore, the senses
are superior to the body as a whole. These outlets are not in use when there is
superior consciousness, or Kṛṣṇa consciousness. In Kṛṣṇa consciousness the soul
makes direct connection with the Supreme Personality of Godhead; therefore the
bodily functions, as described here, ultimately end in the Supreme Soul. Bodily
action means the functions of the senses, and stopping the senses means stopping
all bodily actions. But since the mind is active, then, even though the body may
be silent and at rest, the mind will act—as it does during dreaming. But, above
the mind there is the determination of the intelligence, and above the
intelligence is the soul proper. If, therefore, the soul is directly engaged
with the Supreme, naturally all other subordinates, namely, the intelligence,
mind and the senses, will be automatically engaged. In the Kaṭha Upaniṣad there
is a passage in which it is said that the objects of sense gratification are
superior to the senses, and mind is superior to the sense objects. If,
therefore, the mind is directly engaged in the service of the Lord constantly,
then there is no chance of the senses becoming engaged in other ways. This
mental attitude has already been explained. If the mind is engaged in the
transcendental service of the Lord, there is no chance of its being engaged in
the lower propensities. In the Kaṭha Upaniṣad the soul has been described as
mahān, the great. Therefore the soul is above all—namely, the sense objects, the
senses, the mind and the intelligence. Therefore, directly understanding the
constitutional position of the soul is the solution of the whole problem.</p>
<p>With intelligence one has to seek out the constitutional position of the soul
and then engage the mind always in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That solves the whole
problem. A neophyte spiritualist is generally advised to keep aloof from the
objects of senses. One has to strengthen the mind by use of intelligence. If by
intelligence one engages one’s mind in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, by complete
surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, then, automatically, the mind
becomes stronger, and even though the senses are very strong, like serpents,
they will be no more effective than serpents with broken fangs. But even though
the soul is the master of intelligence and mind, and the senses also, still,
unless it is strengthened by association with Kṛṣṇa in Kṛṣṇa consciousness,
there is every chance of falling down due to the agitated mind.</p>

<p>Thus knowing oneself to be transcendental to material senses, mind and

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>This Third Chapter of the Bhagavad-gītā is conclusively directive to Kṛṣṇa
consciousness by knowing oneself as the eternal servitor of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, without considering impersonal voidness as the ultimate
end. In the material existence of life, one is certainly influenced by
propensities for lust and desire for dominating the resources of material
nature. Desire for overlording and sense gratification are the greatest enemies
of the conditioned soul; but by the strength of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, one can
control the material senses, the mind and the intelligence. One may not give up
work and prescribed duties all of a sudden; but by gradually developing Kṛṣṇa
consciousness, one can be situated in a transcendental position without being
influenced by the material senses and the mind—by steady intelligence directed
toward one’s pure identity. This is the sum total of this chapter. In the
immature stage of material existence, philosophical speculations and artificial
attempts to control the senses by the so-called practice of yogic postures can
never help a man toward spiritual life. He must be trained in Kṛṣṇa
consciousness by higher intelligence.</p>
