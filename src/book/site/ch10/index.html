<p>śrī bhagavān uvāca—the Supreme Personality of Godhead said; bhūyaḥ—again;
eva—certainly; mahā-bāho—O mighty-armed; śṛṇu—just hear; me—My; paramaṁ—supreme;
vacaḥ—information; yat—that which; te—to you; aham—I; prīyamāṇāya—thinking you
dear to Me; vakṣyāmi—say; hita-kāmyayā—for your benefit.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Lord said: My dear friend, mighty-armed Arjuna, listen again to My
supreme word, which I shall impart to you for your benefit and which will give
you great joy.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The word paramam is explained thus by Parāśara Muni: one who is full in six
opulences, who has full strength, full fame, wealth, knowledge, beauty and
renunciation, is paramam, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead. While Kṛṣṇa was
present on this earth, He displayed all six opulences. Therefore great sages
like Parāśara Muni have all accepted Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. Now Kṛṣṇa is instructing Arjuna in more confidential knowledge of His
opulences and His work. Previously, beginning with the Seventh Chapter, the Lord
already explained His different energies and how they are acting. Now in this
chapter He explains His specific opulences to Arjuna. In the previous chapter he
has clearly explained His different energies to establish devotion in firm
conviction. Again in this chapter He tells Arjuna about His manifestations and
various opulences.</p>
<p>The more one hears about the Supreme God, the more one becomes fixed in
devotional service. One should always hear about the Lord in the association of
devotees; that will enhance one’s devotional service. Discourses in the society
of devotees can take place only among those who are really anxious to be in
Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Others cannot take part in such discourses. The Lord
clearly tells Arjuna that because he is very dear to Him, for his benefit such
discourses are taking place.</p>

<p>na—never; me—My; viduḥ—knows; sura-gaṇāḥ—demigods; prabhavam—opulences;
na—never; maharṣayaḥ—great sages; aham—I am; ādiḥ—the origin; hi—certainly;
devānām—of the demigods; maharṣīṇām—of the great sages; ca—also; sarvaśaḥ—in all
respects.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Neither the hosts of demigods nor the great sages know My origin, for, in every
respect, I am the source of the demigods and the sages.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>As stated in the Brahma-saṁhitā, Lord Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Lord. No one is
greater than Him; He is the cause of all causes. Here it is also stated by the
Lord personally that He is the cause of all the demigods and sages. Even the
demigods and great sages cannot understand Kṛṣṇa; they can understand neither
His name nor His personality, so what is the position of the so-called scholars
of this tiny planet? No one can understand why this Supreme God comes to earth
as an ordinary human being and executes such commonplace and yet wonderful
activities. One should know, then, that scholarship is not the qualification
necessary to understand Kṛṣṇa. Even the demigods and the great sages have tried
to understand Kṛṣṇa by their mental speculation, and they have failed to do so.
In the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam also it is clearly said that even the great demigods
are not able to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. They can
speculate to the limits of their imperfect senses and can reach the opposite
conclusion of impersonalism, of something not manifested by the three qualities
of material nature, or they can imagine something by mental speculation, but it
is not possible to understand Kṛṣṇa by such foolish speculation.</p>
<p>Here the Lord indirectly says that if anyone wants to know the Absolute Truth,
“Here I am present as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. I am the Supreme.” One
should know this. Although one cannot understand the inconceivable Lord who is
personally present, He nonetheless exists. We can actually understand Kṛṣṇa, who
is eternal, full of bliss and knowledge, simply by studying His words in
Bhagavad-gītā and Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. The impersonal Brahman can be conceived by
persons who are already in the inferior energy of the Lord, but the Personality
of Godhead cannot be conceived unless one is in the transcendental position.</p>
<p>Because most men cannot understand Kṛṣṇa in His actual situation, out of His
causeless mercy He descends to show favor to such speculators. Yet despite the
Supreme Lord’s uncommon activities, these speculators, due to contamination in
the material energy, still think that the impersonal Brahman is the Supreme.
Only the devotees who are fully surrendered unto the Supreme Lord can
understand, by the grace of the Supreme Personality, that He is Kṛṣṇa. The
devotees of the Lord do not bother about the impersonal Brahman conception of
God; their faith and devotion bring them to surrender immediately unto the
Supreme Lord, and out of the causeless mercy of Kṛṣṇa, they can understand
Kṛṣṇa. No one else can understand Him. So even great sages agree: What is ātmā,
what is the Supreme? It is He whom we have to worship.</p>

<p>yaḥ—anyone; mām—unto Me; ajam—unborn; anādim—without beginning; ca—also;
vetti—knows; loka—the planets; maheśvaram—supreme master; asaṁmūḍhaḥ—without
doubt; saḥ—he; martyeṣu—among those subject to death; sarva-pāpaiḥ—from all
sinful reactions; pramucyate—is delivered.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>He who knows Me as the unborn, as the beginningless, as the Supreme Lord of all
the worlds—he, undeluded among men, is freed from all sins.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>As stated in the Seventh Chapter, those who are trying to elevate themselves to
the platform of spiritual realization are not ordinary men. They are superior to
millions and millions of ordinary men who have no knowledge of spiritual
realization, but out of those actually trying to understand their spiritual
situation, one who can come to the understanding that Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, the proprietor of everything, the unborn, is the most
successful spiritually realized person. In that stage only, when one has fully
understood Kṛṣṇa’s supreme position, can one be free completely from all sinful
reactions.</p>
<p>Here the word ajam, meaning unborn, should not be confused with the living
entities, who are described in the Second Chapter as ajam. The Lord is different
from the living entities who are taking birth and dying due to material
attachment. The conditional souls are changing their bodies, but His body is not
changeable. Even when He comes to this material world, He comes as the same
unborn; therefore in the Fourth Chapter it is said that the Lord, by His
internal potency, is not under the inferior material energy, but is always in
the superior energy.</p>
<p>He was existing before the creation, and He is different from His creation. All
the demigods were created within this material world, but as far as Kṛṣṇa is
concerned, it is said that He is not created; therefore Kṛṣṇa is different even
from the great demigods like Brahmā and Śiva. And because He is the creator of
Brahmā, Śiva and all the other demigods, He is the Supreme Person of all
planets.</p>
<p>Śrī Kṛṣṇa is therefore different from everything that is created, and anyone who
knows Him as such immediately becomes liberated from all sinful reaction. One
must be liberated from all sinful activities to be in the knowledge of the
Supreme Lord. Only by devotional service can He be known and not by any other
means, as stated in Bhagavad-gītā.</p>
<p>One should not try to understand Kṛṣṇa as a human being. As stated previously,
only a foolish person thinks Him to be a human being. This is again expressed
here in a different way. A man who is not foolish, who is intelligent enough to
understand the constitutional position of the Godhead, is always free from all
sinful reactions.</p>
<p>If Kṛṣṇa is known as the son of Devakī, then how can He be unborn? That is also
explained in Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam: When He appeared before Devakī and Vasudeva, He
was not born as an ordinary child; He appeared in His original form, and then He
transformed Himself into an ordinary child.</p>
<p>Anything done under the direction of Kṛṣṇa is transcendental. It cannot be
contaminated by the material reactions, which may be auspicious or inauspicious.
The conception that there are things auspicious and inauspicious in the material
world is more or less a mental concoction because there is nothing auspicious in
the material world. Everything is inauspicious because the very material mask is
inauspicious. We simply imagine it to be auspicious. Real auspiciousness depends
on activities in Kṛṣṇa consciousness in full devotion and service. Therefore if
we at all want our activities to he auspicious, then we should work under the
directions of the Supreme Lord. Such directions are given in authoritative
scriptures such as Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam and Bhagavad-gītā, or from a bona fide
spiritual master. Because the spiritual master is the representative of the
Supreme Lord, his direction is directly the direction of the Supreme Lord. The
spiritual master, saintly persons and scriptures direct in the same way. There
is no contradiction in these three sources. All actions done under such
direction are free from the reactions of pious or impious activities of this
material world. The transcendental attitude of the devotee in the performance of
activities is actually that of renunciation, and this is called sannyāsa. Anyone
acting under the direction of the Supreme Lord is actually a sannyāsī and a
yogī, and not the man who has simply taken the dress of the sannyāsī, or a
pseudo-yogī.</p>

truthfulness, self-control and calmness, pleasure and pain, birth, death, fear,
fearlessness, nonviolence, equanimity, satisfaction, austerity, charity, fame
and infamy are created by Me alone.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The different qualities of living entities, be they good or bad, are all created
by Kṛṣṇa, and they are described here.</p>
<p>Intelligence refers to the power of analyzing things in proper perspective, and
knowledge refers to understanding what is spirit and what is matter. Ordinary
knowledge obtained by a university education pertains only to matter, and it is
not accepted here as knowledge. Knowledge means knowing the distinction between
spirit and matter. In modern education there is no knowledge about the spirit;
they are simply taking care of the material elements and bodily needs. Therefore
academic knowledge is not complete.</p>
<p>Asaṁmohaḥ, freedom from doubt and delusion, can be achieved when one is not
hesitant and when he understands the transcendental philosophy. Slowly but
surely he becomes free from bewilderment. Nothing should be accepted blindly;
everything should be accepted with care and with caution. Kṣamā, forgiveness,
should be practiced, and one should excuse the minor offenses of others. Satyam,
truthfulness, means that facts should be presented as they are for the benefit
of others. Facts should not be misrepresented. According to social conventions,
it is said that one can speak the truth only when it is palatable to others. But
that is not truthfulness. The truth should be spoken in a straight and forward
way, so that others will understand actually what the facts are. If a man is a
thief and if people are warned that he is a thief, that is truth. Although
sometimes the truth is unpalatable, one should not refrain from speaking it.
Truthfulness demands that the facts be presented as they are for the benefit of
others. That is the definition of truth.</p>
<p>Self-control means that the senses should not be used for unnecessary personal
enjoyment. There is no prohibition against meeting the proper needs of the
senses, but unnecessary sense enjoyment is detrimental for spiritual
advancement. Therefore the senses should be restrained from unnecessary use.
Similarly, the mind should not indulge in unnecessary thoughts; that is called
śamaḥ, or calmness. Nor should one spend one’s time pondering over earning
money. That is a misuse of the thinking power. The mind should be used to
understand the prime necessity of human beings, and that should be presented
authoritatively. The power of thought should be developed in association with
persons who are authorities in the scriptures, saintly persons and spiritual
masters and those whose thinking is highly developed. Sukham, pleasure or
happiness, should always be in that which is favorable for the cultivation of
the spiritual knowledge of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. And similarly, that which is
painful or which causes distress is that which is unfavorable for the
cultivation of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Anything favorable for the development of
Kṛṣṇa consciousness should be accepted, and anything unfavorable should be
rejected.</p>
<p>Bhava, birth, should be understood to refer to the body. As far as the soul is
concerned, there is neither birth nor death; that we have discussed in the
beginning of Bhagavad-gītā. Birth and death apply to one’s embodiment in the
material world. Fear is due to worrying about the future. A person in Kṛṣṇa
consciousness has no fear because by his activities he is sure to go back to the
spiritual sky, back home, back to Godhead. Therefore his future is very bright.
Others, however, do not know what their future holds; they have no knowledge of
what the next life holds. So they are therefore in constant anxiety. If we want
to get free from anxiety, then the best course is to understand Kṛṣṇa and be
situated always in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. In that way we will be free from all
fear. In the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. it is stated that fear is caused by our
absorption in the illusory energy, but those who are free from the illusory
energy, those who are confident that they are not the material body, that they
are spiritual parts of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and are therefore
engaged in the transcendental service of the Supreme Godhead, have nothing to
fear. Their future is very bright. This fear is a condition of persons who are
not in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Bhayam, fearlessness, is only possible for one in
Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</p>
<p>Ahiṁsā, nonviolence, means that one should not do anything which will put others
into misery or confusion. Material activities that are promised by so many
politicians, sociologists, philanthropists, etc., do not produce very good
results because the politicians and philanthropists have no transcendental
vision; they do not know what is actually beneficial for human society. Ahiṁsā
means that people should be trained in such a way that the full utilization of
the human body can be achieved. The human body is meant for spiritual
realization, so any movement or any commissions which do not further that end
commit violence on the human body. That which furthers the future spiritual
happiness of the people in general is called nonviolence.</p>
<p>Samatā, equanimity, refers to freedom from attachment and aversion. To be very
much attached or to be very much detached is not the best. This material world
should be accepted without attachment or aversion. Similarly, that which is
favorable for prosecuting Kṛṣṇa consciousness should be accepted; that which is
unfavorable should be rejected. That is called samatā, equanimity. A person in
Kṛṣṇa consciousness has nothing to reject and nothing to accept unless it is
useful in the prosecution of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</p>
<p>Tuṣṭiḥ, satisfaction, means that one should not be eager to gather more and more
material goods by unnecessary activity. One should be satisfied with whatever is
obtained by the grace of the Supreme Lord; that is called satisfaction. Tapas
means austerity or penance. There are many rules and definitions in the Vedas
which apply here, like rising early in the morning and taking a bath. Sometimes
it is very troublesome to rise early in the morning, but whatever voluntary
trouble one may suffer in this way is called penance. Similarly, there are
prescriptions for fasting on certain days of the month. One may not be inclined
to practice such fasting, but because of his determination to make advancement
in the science of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he should accept such bodily troubles
which are recommended. However, one should not fast unnecessarily or against
Vedic injunctions. One should not fast for some political purpose; that is
described in Bhagavad-gītā as fasting in ignorance, and anything done in
ignorance or passion does not lead to spiritual advancement. Everything done in
the mode of goodness does advance one, however, and fasting done in terms of the
Vedic injunctions enriches one in spiritual knowledge.</p>
<p>As far as charity is concerned, one should give fifty percent of his earnings to
some good cause. And what is a good cause? It is that which is conducted in
terms of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That is not only a good cause, but it is the best
cause. Because Kṛṣṇa is good, His cause is also good. Thus charity should be
given to a person who is engaged in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. According to Vedic
literature, it is enjoined that charity should be given to the brāhmaṇas. This
practice is still followed, although not very nicely in terms of the Vedic
injunction. But still the injunction is that charity should be given to the
brāhmaṇas. Why? Because they are engaged in higher cultivation of spiritual
knowledge. A brāhmaṇa is supposed to devote his whole life to understanding
Brahman. A brahma-jana is one who knows Brahman; he is called a brāhmaṇa. Thus
charity is offered to the brāhmaṇas because since they are always engaged in
higher spiritual service, they have no time to earn their livelihood. In the
Vedic literature, charity is also to be awarded to the renouncer of life, the
sannyāsī. The sannyāsīs beg from door to door, not for money but for missionary
purposes. The system is that they go from door to door to awaken the
householders from the slumber of ignorance. Because the householders are engaged
in family affairs and have forgotten their actual purpose in life—awakening
their Kṛṣṇa consciousness—it is the business of the sannyāsīs to go as beggars
to the householders and encourage them to be Kṛṣṇa conscious. As it is said in
the Vedas, one should awake and achieve what is due him in this human form of
life. This knowledge and method is distributed by the sannyāsīs; hence charity
is to be given to the renouncer of life, to the brāhmaṇas, and similar good
causes, not to any whimsical cause.</p>
<p>Yaśaḥ, fame, should be according to Lord Caitanya, who said that a man is famous
when he is known as a great devotee. That is real fame. If one has become a
great man in Kṛṣṇa consciousness and it is known, then he is truly famous. One
who does not have such fame is infamous.</p>
<p>All these qualities are manifest throughout the universe in human society and in
the society of the demigods. There are many forms of humanity on other planets,
and these qualities are there. Now, for one who wants to advance in Kṛṣṇa
consciousness, Kṛṣṇa creates all these qualities, but the person develops them
himself from within. One who engages in the devotional service of the Supreme
Lord develops all the good qualities, as arranged by the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Of whatever we find, good or bad, the origin is Kṛṣṇa. Nothing can manifest in
this material world which is not in Kṛṣṇa. That is knowledge; although we know
that things are differently situated, we should realize that everything flows
from Kṛṣṇa.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Lord is giving a genealogical synopsis of the universal population. Brahmā
is the original creature born out of the energy of the Supreme Lord known as
Hiraṇyagarbha. And from Brahmā all the seven great sages, and before them four
other great sages, named Sanaka, Sananda, Sanātana, and Sanatkumāra, and the
Manus, are manifest. All these twenty-five great sages are known as the
patriarchs of the living entities all over the universe. There are innumerable
universes and innumerable planets within each universe, and each planet is full
of population of different varieties. All of them are born of these twenty-five
patriarchs. Brahmā underwent penance for one thousand years of the demigods
before he realized by the grace of Kṛṣṇa how to create. Then from Brahmā,
Sanaka, Sananda, Sanātana, and Sanatkumāra came out, then Rudra, and then the
seven sages, and in this way all the brāhmaṇas and kṣatriyas are born out of the
energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Brahmā is known as pitāmaha, the
grandfather, and Kṛṣṇa is known as the prapitā-maha, the father of the
grandfather. That is stated in the Eleventh Chapter of the Bhagavad-gītā. (### .

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The highest summit of spiritual perfection is knowledge of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. Unless one is firmly convinced of the different
opulences of the Supreme Lord, he cannot engage in devotional service. Generally
people know that God is great, but they do not know in detail how God is great.
Here are the details. If one knows factually how God is great, then naturally he
becomes a surrendered soul and engages himself in the devotional service of the
Lord. When one factually knows the opulences of the Supreme, there is no
alternative but to surrender to Him. This factual knowledge can be known from
the descriptions in Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam and Bhagavad-gītā and similar literatures.</p>
<p>In the administration of this universe there are many demigods distributed
throughout the planetary system, and the chief of them are Brahmā, Lord Śiva and
the four great Kumāras and other patriarchs. There are many forefathers of the
population of the universe, and all of them are born of the Supreme Lord Kṛṣṇa.
The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, is the original forefather of all
forefathers.</p>
<p>These are some of the opulences of the Supreme Lord. When one is firmly
convinced of them, he accepts Kṛṣṇa with great faith and without any doubt, and
he engages in devotional service. All this particular knowledge is required in
order to increase one’s interest in the loving devotional service of the Lord.
One should not neglect to understand fully how great Kṛṣṇa is, for by knowing
the greatness of Kṛṣṇa one will be able to be fixed in sincere devotional
service.</p>

<p>I am the source of all spiritual and material worlds. Everything emanates from
Me. The wise who know this perfectly engage in My devotional service and worship
Me with all their hearts.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>A learned scholar who has studied the Vedas perfectly and has information from
authorities like Lord Caitanya and who knows how to apply these teachings can
understand that Kṛṣṇa is the origin of everything in both the material and
spiritual worlds, and because he knows this perfectly he becomes firmly fixed in
the devotional service of the Supreme Lord. He can never be deviated by any
amount of nonsensical commentaries or by fools. All Vedic literature agrees that
Kṛṣṇa is the source of Brahmā, Śiva and all other demigods. In the Atharva-veda
it is said, “yo brahmāṇaṁ vidadhāti: pūrvaṁ yo vai vedāṁś ca gāpayati sma
kṛṣṇaḥ.” “It was Kṛṣṇa who in the beginning instructed Brahmā in Vedic knowledge
and who disseminated Vedic knowledge in the past.” Then again it is said, “atha
puruṣo ha vai nārāyaṇo ’kāmayata prajāḥ sṛjeya ity upakramya.” “Then the Supreme
Personality Nārāyaṇa desired to create living entities.” Again it is said:</p>
<p>nārāyaṇād brahmā jāyate, nārāyaṇād prajāpatiḥ prajāyate, nārāyaṇād indro jāyate,
nārāyaṇād aṣṭau vasavo jāyante, nārāyaṇād ekādaśa rudrā jāyante, nārāyaṇād
dvādaśādityāḥ.</p>
<p>“From Nārāyaṇa, Brahmā is born, and from Nārāyaṇa, the patriarchs are also born.
From Nārāyaṇa, Indra is born, from Nārāyaṇa the eight Vasus are born, from
Nārāyaṇa the eleven Rudras are born, from Nārāyaṇa the twelve Ādityas are born.”</p>
<p>It is said in the same Vedas: brahmaṇyo devakī-putraḥ: “The son of Devakī,
Kṛṣṇa, is the Supreme Personality.” Then it is said:</p>
<p>eko vai nārāyaṇa āsīn na brahmā na īśāno nāpo nāgni samau neme dyāv-āpṛthivī na
nakṣatrāṇi na sūryaḥ sa ekākī na ramate tasya dhyānāntaḥ sthasya yatra
chāndogaiḥ kriyamāṇāṣṭakādi-saṁjñakā stuti-stomaḥ stomam ucyate.</p>
<p>“In the beginning of the creation there was only the Supreme Personality
Nārāyaṇa. There was no Brahmā, no Śiva, no fire, no moon, no stars in the sky,
no sun. There was only Kṛṣṇa, who creates all and enjoys all.”</p>
<p>In the many Purāṇas it is said that Lord Śiva was born from the highest, the
Supreme Lord Kṛṣṇa, and the Vedas say that it is the Supreme Lord, the creator
of Brahmā and Śiva, who is to be worshiped. In the Mokṣa-dharma Kṛṣṇa also says,
prajāpatiṁ ca rudraṁ cāpy aham eva sṛjāmi vai tau hi māṁ na vijānīto mama
māyā-vimohitau. “The patriarchs, Śiva and others are created by Me, though they
do not know that they are created by Me because they are deluded by My illusory
energy.” In Varāha Purāṇa it is also said, nārāyaṇaḥ paro devas tasmāj jātaś
caturmukhaḥ tasmād rudro ’bhavad devaḥ sa ca sarvajñatāṁ gataḥ. “Nārāyaṇa is the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, and from Him Brahmā was born, from whom Śiva was
born.”</p>
<p>Lord Kṛṣṇa is the source of all generations, and He is called the most efficient
cause of everything. He says that because “everything is born of Me, I am the
original source of all. Everything is under Me; no one is above Me.” There is no
supreme controller other than Kṛṣṇa. One who understands Kṛṣṇa in such a way
from a bona fide spiritual master and from Vedic literature, who engages all his
energy in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, becomes a truly learned man. In comparison to
him, all others, who do not know Kṛṣṇa properly, are but fools. Only a fool
would consider Kṛṣṇa to be an ordinary man. A Kṛṣṇa conscious person should not
be bewildered by fools; he should avoid all unauthorized commentaries and
interpretations on Bhagavad-gītā and proceed in Kṛṣṇa consciousness with
determination and firmness.</p>

<p>The thoughts of My pure devotees dwell in Me, their lives are surrendered to Me,
and they derive great satisfaction and bliss enlightening one another and
conversing about Me.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Pure devotees, whose characteristics are mentioned here, engage themselves fully
in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. Their minds cannot be diverted
from the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa. Their talks are solely on the transcendental
subjects. The symptoms of the pure devotees are described in this verse
specifically. Devotees of the Supreme Lord are twenty-four hours daily engaged
in glorifying the pastimes of the Supreme Lord. Their hearts and souls are
constantly submerged in Kṛṣṇa, and they take pleasure in discussing Him with
other devotees.</p>
<p>In the preliminary stage of devotional service they relish the transcendental
pleasure from the service itself, and in the mature stage they are actually
situated in love of God. Once situated in that transcendental position, they can
relish the highest perfection which is exhibited by the Lord in His abode. Lord
Caitanya likens transcendental devotional service to the sowing of a seed in the
heart of the living entity. There are innumerable living entities traveling
throughout the different planets of the universe, and out of them there are a
few who are fortunate enough to meet a pure devotee and get the chance to
understand devotional service. This devotional service is just like a seed, and
if it is sown in the heart of a living entity, and if he goes on hearing and
chanting, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma,
Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare, that seed fructifies, just as the seed of a tree
fructifies with regular watering. The spiritual plant of devotional service
gradually grows and grows until it penetrates the covering of the material
universe and enters into the brahmajyoti effulgence in the spiritual sky. In the
spiritual sky also that plant grows more and more until it reaches the highest
planet, which is called Goloka Vṛndāvana, the supreme planet of Kṛṣṇa.
Ultimately, the plant takes shelter under the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa and rests
there. Gradually, as a plant grows fruits and flowers, that plant of devotional
service also produces fruits, and the watering process in the form of chanting
and hearing goes on. This plant of devotional service is fully described in the
Caitanya-caritāmṛta. It is explained there that when the complete plant takes
shelter under the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord, one becomes fully absorbed in
love of God; then he cannot live even for a moment without being in contact with
the Supreme Lord, just as a fish cannot live without water. In such a state, the
devotee actually attains the transcendental qualities in contact with the
Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>The Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam is also full of such narration about the relationship
between the Supreme Lord and His devotees; therefore the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam is
very dear to the devotees. In this narration there is nothing about material
activities, sense gratification or liberation. Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam is the only
narration in which the transcendental nature of the Supreme Lord and His
devotees is fully described. Thus the realized souls in Kṛṣṇa consciousness take
continual pleasure in hearing such transcendental literatures, just as a young
boy and girl take pleasure in association.</p>

<p>To those who are constantly devoted and worship Me with love, I give the

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In this verse the word buddhi-yogam is very significant. We may remember that in
the Second Chapter the Lord, instructing Arjuna, said that He had spoken to him
of many things and that He would instruct him in the way of buddhi-yoga. Now
buddhi-yoga is explained. Buddhi-yogam itself is action in Kṛṣṇa consciousness;
that is the highest intelligence. Buddhi means intelligence, and yogam means
mystic activities or mystic elevation. When one tries to go back home, back to
Godhead, and takes fully to Kṛṣṇa consciousness in devotional service, his
action is called buddhi-yogam. In other words, buddhi-yogam is the process by
which one gets out of the entanglement of this material world. The ultimate goal
of progress is Kṛṣṇa. People do not know this; therefore the association of
devotees and a bona fide spiritual master are important. One should know that
the goal is Kṛṣṇa, and when the goal is assigned, then the path is slowly but
progressively traversed, and the ultimate goal is achieved.</p>
<p>When a person knows the goal of life but is addicted to the fruits of
activities, he is acting in karma-yoga. When he knows that the goal is Kṛṣṇa,
but he takes pleasure in mental speculations to understand Kṛṣṇa, he is acting
in jñāna-yoga. And when he knows the goal and seeks Kṛṣṇa completely in Kṛṣṇa
consciousness and devotional service, he is acting in bhakti-yoga, or
buddhi-yoga, which is the complete yoga. This complete yoga is the highest
perfectional stage of life.</p>
<p>A person may have a bona fide spiritual master and may be attached to a
spiritual organization, but still, if he is not intelligent enough to make
progress, then Kṛṣṇa from within gives him instructions so that he may
ultimately come to Him without difficulty. The qualification is that a person
always engage himself in Kṛṣṇa consciousness and with love and devotion render
all kinds of services. He should perform some sort of work for Kṛṣṇa, and that
work should be with love. If a devotee is intelligent enough, he will make
progress on the path of self-realization. If one is sincere and devoted to the
activities of devotional service, the Lord gives him a chance to make progress
and ultimately attain to Him.</p>

<p>Out of compassion for them, I, dwelling in their hearts, destroy with the

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>When Lord Caitanya was in Benares promulgating the chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare
Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare,
thousands of people were following Him. Prakāśānanda, a very influential and
learned scholar in Benares at that time, derided Lord Caitanya for being a
sentimentalist. Sometimes philosophers criticize the devotees because they think
that most of the devotees are in the darkness of ignorance and are
philosophically naive sentimentalists. Actually that is not the fact. There are
very, very learned scholars who have put forward the philosophy of devotion, but
even if a devotee does not take advantage of their literatures or of his
spiritual master, if he is sincere in his devotional service he is helped by
Kṛṣṇa Himself within his heart. So the sincere devotee engaged in Kṛṣṇa
consciousness cannot be without knowledge. The only qualification is that one
carry out devotional service in full Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</p>
<p>The modern philosophers think that without discriminating one cannot have pure
knowledge. For them this answer is given by the Supreme Lord: those who are
engaged in pure devotional service, even though they be without sufficient
education and even without sufficient knowledge of the Vedic principles, are
still helped by the Supreme God, as stated in this verse.</p>
<p>The Lord tells Arjuna that basically there is no possibility of understanding
the Supreme Truth, the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
simply by speculating, for the Supreme Truth is so great that it is not possible
to understand Him or to achieve Him simply by making a mental effort. Man can go
on speculating for several millions of years, and if he is not devoted, if he is
not a lover of the Supreme Truth, he will never understand Kṛṣṇa or the Supreme
Truth. Only by devotional service is the Supreme Truth, Kṛṣṇa, pleased, and by
His inconceivable energy He can reveal Himself to the heart of the pure devotee.
The pure devotee always has Kṛṣṇa within his heart; therefore he is just like
the sun that dissipates the darkness of ignorance. This is the special mercy
rendered to the pure devotee by Kṛṣṇa.</p>
<p>Due to the contamination of material association, through many, many millions of
births, one’s heart is always covered with the dust of materialism, but when one
engages in devotional service and constantly chants Hare Kṛṣṇa, the dust quickly
clears, and one is elevated to the platform of pure knowledge. The ultimate goal
of Viṣṇu can be attained only by this chant and by devotional service, and not
by mental speculation or argument. The pure devotee does not have to worry about
the necessities of life; he need not be anxious because when he removes the
darkness from his heart, everything is provided automatically by the Supreme
Lord, for He is pleased by the loving devotional service of the devotee. This is
the essence of the Gītā’s teachings. By studying Bhagavad-gītā, one can become a
completely surrendered soul to the Supreme Lord and engage himself in pure
devotional service. As the Lord takes charge, one becomes completely free from
all kinds of materialistic endeavors.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In these two verses the Supreme Lord gives a chance to the modern philosopher,
for here it is clear that the Supreme is different from the individual soul.
Arjuna, after hearing the essential four verses of Bhagavad-gītā in this
chapter, became completely free from all doubts and accepted Kṛṣṇa as the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. He at once boldly declares, “You are
Parambrahma, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.” And previously Kṛṣṇa states
that He is the originator of everything and everyone. Every demigod and every
human being is dependant on Him. Men and demigods, out of ignorance, think that
they are absolute and independant of the Supreme Lord Kṛṣṇa. That ignorance is
removed perfectly by the discharge of devotional service. This is already
explained in the previous verse by the Lord. Now by His grace, Arjuna is
accepting Him as the Supreme Truth, in concordance with the Vedic injunction. It
is not because Kṛṣṇa is an intimate friend of Arjuna that he is flattering Him
by calling Him the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth. Whatever
Arjuna says in these two verses is confirmed by Vedic truth. Vedic injunctions
affirm that only one who takes to devotional service to the Supreme Lord can
understand Him, whereas others cannot. Each and every word of this verse spoken
by Arjuna is confirmed by Vedic injunction.</p>
<p>In the Kena Upaniṣad it is stated that the Supreme Brahman is the rest for
everything, and Kṛṣṇa has already explained that everything is resting on Him.
The Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad confirms that the Supreme Lord, in whom everything is
resting, can be realized only by those who engage constantly in thinking of Him.
This constant thinking of Kṛṣṇa is smaraṇam, one of the methods of devotional
service. It is only by devotional service to Kṛṣṇa that one can understand his
position and get rid of this material body.</p>
<p>In the Vedas the Supreme Lord is accepted as the purest of the pure. One who
understands that Kṛṣṇa is the purest of the pure can become purified from all
sinful activities. One cannot be disinfected from sinful activities unless he
surrenders unto the Supreme Lord. Arjuna’s acceptance of Kṛṣṇa as the supreme
pure complies with the injunctions of Vedic literature. This is also confirmed
by great personalities, of whom Nārada is the chief.</p>
<p>Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and one should always meditate upon
Him and enjoy one’s transcendental relationship with Him. He is the supreme
existence. He is free from bodily needs, birth and death. Not only does Arjuna
confirm this, but all the Vedic literatures. the Purāṇas and histories. In all
Vedic literatures Kṛṣṇa is thus described, and the Supreme Lord Himself also
says in the Fourth Chapter, “Although I am unborn, I appear on this earth to
establish religious principles.” He is the supreme origin; He has no cause, for
He is the cause of all causes, and everything is emanating from Him. This
perfect knowledge can be had by the grace of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Here Arjuna expresses himself through the grace of Kṛṣṇa. If we want to
understand Bhagavad-gītā, we should accept the statements in these two verses.
This is called the paramparā system, acceptance of the disciplic succession.
Unless one is in the disciplic succession, he cannot understand Bhagavad-gītā.
It is not possible by so-called academic education. Unfortunately those proud of
their academic education, despite so much evidence in Vedic literatures, stick
to their obstinate conviction that Kṛṣṇa is an ordinary person.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Arjuna herein confirms that persons of faithless and demonic nature cannot
understand Kṛṣṇa. He is not even known by the demigods, so what to speak of the
so-called scholars of this modern world? By the grace of the Supreme Lord,
Arjuna has understood that the Supreme Truth is Kṛṣṇa and that He is the perfect
one. One should therefore follow the path of Arjuna. He received the authority
of Bhagavad-gītā. As described in the Fourth Chapter, the paramparā system of
disciplic succession for the understanding of Bhagavad-gītā was lost, and
therefore Kṛṣṇa reestablished that disciplic succession with Arjuna because He
considered Arjuna His intimate friend and a great devotee. Therefore, as stated
in our Introduction to Gītopaniṣad, Bhagavad-gītā should be understood in the
paramparā system. When the paramparā system was lost, Arjuna was again selected
to rejuvenate it. The acceptance of Arjuna of all that Kṛṣṇa says should be
emulated; then we can understand the essence of Bhagavad-gītā, and then only can
we understand that Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>

<p>The Supreme Lord Kṛṣṇa can be known by persons who are in a relationship with
Him through the discharge of devotional service, like Arjuna and his successors.
Persons of demonic or atheistic mentality cannot know Kṛṣṇa. Mental speculation
that leads one away from the Supreme Lord is a serious sin, and one who does not
know Kṛṣṇa should not try to comment on Bhagavad-gītā. Bhagavad-gītā is the
statement of Kṛṣṇa, and since it is the science of Kṛṣṇa, it should be
understood from Kṛṣṇa as Arjuna understood it. It should not be received from
atheistic persons.</p>
<p>The Supreme Truth is realized in three aspects: as impersonal Brahman, localized
Paramātmā and at last as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. So at the last
stage of understanding the Absolute Truth, one comes to the Supreme Personality
of Godhead. A liberated man and even a common man may realize impersonal Brahman
or localized Paramātmā, yet they may not understand God’s personality from the
verses of Bhagavad-gītā, which are being spoken by this person, Kṛṣṇa. Sometimes
the impersonalists accept Kṛṣṇa as Bhagavan, or they accept His authority. Yet
many liberated persons cannot understand Kṛṣṇa as Puruṣottama, the Supreme
Person, the father of all living entities. Therefore Arjuna addresses Him as
Puruṣottama. And if one comes to know Him as the father of all the living
entities, still one may not know Him as the supreme controller; therefore He is
addressed here as Bhūteśa, the supreme controller of everyone. And even if one
knows Kṛṣṇa as the supreme controller of all living entities, still one may not
know that He is the origin of all the demigods; therefore He is addressed herein
as Devadeva, the worshipful God of all demigods. And even if one knows Him as
the worshipful God of all demigods, one may not know that He is the supreme
proprietor of everything; therefore He is addressed as Jagatpati. Thus the truth
about Kṛṣṇa is established in this verse by the realization of Arjuna, and we
should follow in the footsteps of Arjuna to understand Kṛṣṇa as He is.</p>

<p>In this verse it appears that Arjuna is already satisfied with his understanding
of the Supreme Lord Kṛṣṇa. By Kṛṣṇa’s grace, Arjuna has personal experience,
intelligence and knowledge and whatever else a person may have through all these
agencies, and he has understood Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. For
him there is no doubt, Yet he is asking Kṛṣṇa to explain His all-pervading
nature so that in the future people will understand, especially the
impersonalists, how He exists in His all-pervading aspect through His different
energies. One should know that this is being asked by Arjuna on behalf of the
common people.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>As it is stated in the previous chapter, the Supreme Personality of Godhead is
covered by His yoga-māyā. Only surrendered souls and devotees can see Him. Now
Arjuna is convinced that His friend, Kṛṣṇa, is the Supreme Godhead, but he wants
to know the general process by which the all-pervading Lord can be understood by
the common man. No common man, including the demons and atheists, can know Kṛṣṇa
because He is guarded by His yoga-māyā energy. Again, these questions are asked
by Arjuna for their benefit. The superior devotee is not only concerned for his
own understanding, but for the understanding of all mankind. Out of his mercy,
because he is a Vaiṣṇava, a devotee, Arjuna is opening the understanding for the
common man as far as the all-pervasiveness of the Supreme is concerned. He
addresses Kṛṣṇa specifically as yogin because Śrī Kṛṣṇa is the master of the
yoga-māyā energy by which He is covered and uncovered to the common man. The
common man who has no love for Kṛṣṇa cannot always think of Kṛṣṇa; therefore he
has to think materially. Arjuna is considering the mode of thinking of the
materialistic persons of this world. Because materialists cannot understand
Kṛṣṇa spiritually, they are advised to concentrate the mind on physical things
and try to see how Kṛṣṇa is manifested by physical representations.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>A similar statement was made to Sūta Gosvāmī by the ṛṣis of Naimiṣāraṇya, headed
by Śaunaka. That statement is:</p>
<p>vayaṁ tu na vitṛpyāma uttama-śloka-vikrame yac chṛṇvatāṁ rasa-jñānāṁ svādu svādu
pade pade.</p>
<p>“One can never be satiated even though one continuously hears the transcendental
pastimes of Kṛṣṇa, who is glorified by Vedic hymns. Those who have entered into
a transcendental relationship with Kṛṣṇa relish in every step descriptions of
the pastimes of the Lord.” Thus Arjuna is interested to hear about Kṛṣṇa,
specifically how He remains as the all-pervading Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Now as far as amṛtam, nectar, is concerned, any narration or statement
concerning Kṛṣṇa is just like nectar. And this nectar can be perceived by
practical experience. Modern stories, fiction and histories are different from
the transcendental pastimes of the Lord in that one will tire of hearing mundane
stories, but one never tires of hearing about Kṛṣṇa. It is for this reason only
that the history of the whole universe is replete with references to the
pastimes of the incarnations of Godhead. For instance, the Purāṇas are histories
of bygone ages that relate the pastimes of the various incarnations of the Lord.
In this way the reading matter remains forever fresh, despite repeated readings.</p>

<p>The Blessed Lord said: Yes, I will tell you of My splendorous manifestations,
but only of those which are prominent, O Arjuna, for My opulence is limitless.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>It is not possible to comprehend the greatness of Kṛṣṇa and His opulences. The
senses of the individual soul are imperfect and do not permit him to understand
the totality of Kṛṣṇa’s affairs. Still the devotees try to understand Kṛṣṇa, but
not on the principle that they will be able to understand Kṛṣṇa fully at any
specific time or in any state of life. Rather, the very topics of Kṛṣṇa are so
relishable that they appear to them as nectar. Thus they enjoy them. In
discussing Kṛṣṇa’s opulences and His diverse energies, the pure devotees take
transcendental pleasure. Therefore they want to hear and discuss them. Kṛṣṇa
knows that living entities do not understand the extent of His opulences; He
therefore agrees to state only the principal manifestations of His different
energies. The word prādhānyataḥ (principal) is very important because we can
understand only a few of the principal details of the Supreme Lord, for His
features are unlimited. It is not possible to understand them all. And vibhūti,
as used in this verse, refers to the opulences by which He controls the whole
manifestation. In the Amara-kośa dictionary it is stated that vibhūti indicates
an exceptional opulence.</p>
<p>The impersonalist or the pantheist cannot understand the exceptional opulences
of the Supreme Lord nor the manifestations of His divine energy. Both in the
material world and in the spiritual world His energies are distributed in every
variety of manifestation. Now Kṛṣṇa is describing what can be directly perceived
by the common man; thus part of His variegated energy is described in this way.</p>

<p>I am the Self, O Guḍākeśa, seated in the hearts of all creatures. I am the
beginning, the middle and the end of all beings.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In this verse Arjuna is addressed as Guḍākeśa, which means one who has conquered
the darkness of sleep. For those who are sleeping in the darkness of ignorance,
it is not possible to understand how the Supreme Godhead manifests Himself in
the material and spiritual worlds. Thus this address by Kṛṣṇa to Arjuna is
significant. Because Arjuna is above such darkness, the Personality of Godhead
agrees to describe His various opulences.</p>
<p>Kṛṣṇa first informs Arjuna that He is the Self or soul of the entire cosmic
manifestation by dint of His primary expansion. Before the material creation,
the Supreme Lord, by His plenary expansion, accepts the Puruṣa incarnations, and
from Him everything begins. Therefore He is ātmā, the soul of the mahat-tattva,
the universal elements. The total material energy is not the cause of the
creation, but actually the Mahā-Visṇu enters into the mahat-tattva, the total
material energy. He is the soul. When Mahā-Viṣṇu enters into the manifested
universes, He again manifests Himself as the Supersoul in each and every entity.
We have experience that the personal body of the living entity exists due to the
presence of the spiritual spark. Without the existence of the spiritual spark,
the body cannot develop. Similarly, the material manifestation cannot develop
unless the Supreme Soul of Kṛṣṇa enters.</p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead is existing as the Supersoul in all
manifested universes. A description of the three puruṣa-avatāras is given in
Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. “The Supreme Personality of Godhead manifests three features,
as Kāraṇodakaśāyī Visṇu, Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu and Kṣīrodakaśāyī Viṣṇu, in this
material manifestation.” The Supreme Lord Kṛṣṇa, the cause of all causes, lies
down in the cosmic ocean as Mahā-Viṣṇu or Kāraṇodakaśāyī Viṣṇu, and therefore
Kṛṣṇa is the beginning of this universe, the maintainer of the universal
manifestation, and the end of all the energy.</p>

<p>Brahmā, the first living creature within the universe, created several sons for
the propagation of various kinds of species. The most powerful of his sons is
Bhṛgu, who is also the greatest sage. Of all the transcendental vibrations, the

Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma,
Hare Hare is the purest representation of Kṛṣṇa. Sometimes animal sacrifices are
recommended, but in the sacrifice of Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, there is no
question of violence. It is the simplest and the purest. Whatever is sublime in
the worlds is a representation of Kṛṣṇa. Therefore the Himalayas, the greatest
mountains in the world, also represent Him. The mountain named Meru was
mentioned in a previous verse, but Meru is sometimes movable, whereas the
Himalayas are never movable. Thus the Himalayas are greater than Meru.</p>

people in India often worship it as one of their daily morning rituals. Amongst

the nectar were produced many entities, of which there was a horse named

Airāvata. Because these two animals were produced from nectar, they have special

Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira, Mahārāja Parīkṣit and Lord Rāma were all highly righteous
kings who always thought of the citizens’ welfare. In Vedic literature, the king
is considered to be the representative of God. In this age, however, with the

material world, but there is mention of them in Kṛṣṇaloka. The Lord keeps many
such cows, which are called surabhi. It is stated that the Lord is engaged in
herding the surabhi cows. Kandarpa is the sex desire for presenting good sons;

all the Daityas are atheistic. Although Prahlāda was born in the family of the
Daityas, he was a great devotee from his childhood. Because of his devotional
service and godly nature, he is considered to be a representative of Kṛṣṇa.</p>
<p>There are many subduing principles, but time wears down all things in the
material universe and so represents Kṛṣṇa. Of the many animals, the lion is the
most powerful and ferocious, and of the million varieties of birds, Garuḍa, the
bearer of Lord Viṣṇu, is the greatest.</p>

<p>Of all the aquatics the shark is one of the biggest and is certainly the most
dangerous to man. Thus the shark represents Kṛṣṇa. And of rivers, the greatest
in India is the Mother Ganges. Lord Rāmacandra, of the Rāmāyaṇa, an incarnation

Of all sciences I am the spiritual science of the Self, and among logicians I am
the conclusive truth.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Among created manifestations, the total material elements are first created by
Mahā-Viṣṇu and are annihilated by Lord Śiva. Brahmā is the secondary creator.
All these created elements are different incarnations of the material qualities
of the Supreme Lord; therefore He is the beginning, the middle and the end of
all creation.</p>
<p>Regarding the spiritual science of the Self, there are many literatures, such as
the four Vedas, the Vedānta-sūtra and the Purāṇas, the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam and the
Gītā. These are all representatives of Kṛṣṇa. Among logicians there are
different stages of argument. The presentation of evidence is called japa. The
attempt to defeat one another is called vitaṇḍa, and the final conclusion is
called vāda. The conclusive truth, the end of all reasoning processes, is Kṛṣṇa.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Akāra, the first letter of the Sanskrit alphabet, is the beginning of the Vedic
literature. Without akāra, nothing can be sounded; therefore it is the beginning
of sound. In Sanskrit there are also many compound words, of which the dual
word, like Rāma-kṛṣṇa, is called dvandvaḥ. For instance, Rāma and Kṛṣṇa have the
same rhythm and therefore are called dual.</p>
<p>Among all kinds of killers, time is the ultimate because time kills everything.
Time is the representative of Kṛṣṇa because in due course of time there will be
a great fire and everything will be annihilated.</p>
<p>Among the creators and living entities, Brahmā is the chief. The various Brahmās
exhibit four, eight, sixteen, etc., heads accordingly, and they are the chief
creators in their respective universes. The Brahmās are representatives of
Kṛṣṇa.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>As soon as a man is born, he dies at every moment. Thus death is devouring every
living entity at every moment, but the last stroke is called death itself. That
death is Kṛṣṇa. All species of life undergo six basic changes. They are born,
they grow, they remain for some time, they reproduce, they dwindle and finally
vanish. Of these changes, the first is deliverance from the womb, and that is
Kṛṣṇa. The first generation is the beginning of all future activities.</p>
<p>The six opulences listed are considered to be feminine. If a woman possesses all
of them or some of them she becomes glorious. Sanskrit is a perfect language and
is therefore very glorious. After studying, if one can remember the subject
matter, he is gifted with good memory, or smṛti One need not read many books on
different subject matters; the ability to remember a few and quote them when
necessary is also another opulence.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Of hymns I am the Bṛhat-sāma sung to the Lord Indra, and of poetry I am the
Gāyatrī verse, sung daily by brāhmaṇas. Of months I am November and December,
and of seasons I am flower-bearing spring.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>It has already been explained by the Lord that amongst all the Vedas, the
Sāma-veda is rich with beautiful songs played by the various demigods.</p>
<p>One of these songs is the Bṛhat-sāma, which has an exquisite melody and is sung
at midnight.</p>
<p>In Sanskrit, there are definite rules that regulate poetry; rhyme and meter are
not written whimsically, as in much modern poetry. Amongst the regulated poetry,
the Gāyatrī mantra, which is chanted by the duly qualified brāhmaṇas, is the
most prominent. The Gāyatrī mantra is mentioned in the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.
Because the Gāyatrī mantra is especially meant for God realization, it
represents the Supreme Lord. This mantra is meant for spiritually advanced
people, and when one attains success in chanting it, he can enter into the
transcendental position of the Lord. One must first acquire the qualities of the
perfectly situated person, the qualities of goodness according to the laws of
material nature, in order to chant the Gāyatrī mantra. The Gāyatrī mantra is
very important in Vedic civilization and is considered to be the sound
incarnation of Brahman. Brahmā is its initiator, and it is passed down from him
in disciplic succession.</p>
<p>The months of November and December are considered the best of all months
because in India grains are collected from the fields at this time, and the
people become very happy. Of course spring is a season universally liked because
it is neither too hot nor too cold, and the flowers and trees blossom and
flourish. In spring there are also many ceremonies commemorating Kṛṣṇa’s
pastimes; therefore this is considered to be the most joyful of all seasons, and
it is the representative of the Supreme Lord Kṛṣṇa.</p>

<p>There are many kinds of cheaters all over the universe. Of all cheating
processes, gambling stands supreme and therefore represents Kṛṣṇa. As the
Supreme, Kṛṣṇa can be more deceitful than any mere man. If Kṛṣṇa chooses to
deceive a person, no one can surpass Him in His deceit. His greatness is not
simply one-sided—it is all-sided.</p>
<p>Among the victorious, He is victory. He is the splendor of the splendid. Among
enterprising industrialists, He is the most enterprising. Among adventurers, He
is the most adventurous, and among the strong, He is the strongest. When Kṛṣṇa
was present on earth, no one could surpass Him in strength. Even in His
childhood He lifted Govardhana Hill. No one can surpass Him in cheating, no one
can surpass Him in splendor, no one can surpass Him in victory, no one can
surpass Him in enterprise, and no one can surpass Him in strength.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Kṛṣṇa is the original Supreme Personality of Godhead, and Vāsudeva is the
immediate expansion of Kṛṣṇa. Both Lord Kṛṣṇa and Baladeva appear as the sons of
Vasudeva. Amongst the sons of Pāṇḍu, Arjuna is famous and valiant. Indeed, he is
the best of men and therefore represents Kṛṣṇa. Among the munis, or learned men
conversant in Vedic knowledge, Vyāsa is the greatest because he explained Vedic
knowledge in many different ways for the understanding of the common mass of
people in this age of Kali. And Vyāsa is also known as an incarnation of Kṛṣṇa;
therefore Vyāsa also represents Kṛṣṇa. Kavis are those who are capable of
thinking thoroughly on any subject matter. Among the kavis, Uśanā was the
spiritual master of the demons; he was extremely intelligent, far-seeing,
political and spiritual in every way. Thus Uśanā is another representative of
the opulence of Kṛṣṇa.</p>

cut down the miscreants. When miscreants are punished, the rod of chastisement
represents Kṛṣṇa. Among those who are trying to be victorious in some field of
activity, the most victorious element is morality. Among the confidential
activities of hearing, thinking and meditating, silence is most important
because by silence one can make progress very quickly. The wise man is he who
can discriminate between matter and spirit, between God’s superior and inferior
natures. Such knowledge is Kṛṣṇa Himself.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>But what need is there, Arjuna, for all this detailed knowledge? With a single
fragment of Myself I pervade and support this entire universe.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Lord is represented throughout the entire material universes by His
entering into all things as the Supersoul. The Lord here tells Arjuna that there
is no point in understanding how things exist in their separate opulence and
grandeur. He should know that all things are existing due to Kṛṣṇa’s entering
them as Supersoul. From Brahmā, the most gigantic entity, on down to the
smallest ant, all are existing because the Lord has entered each and all and is
sustaining them.</p>
<p>Worship of demigods is discouraged herein because even the greatest demigods
like Brahmā and Śiva only represent part of the opulence of the Supreme Lord. He
is the origin of everyone born, and no one is greater than Him. He is samatā,
which means that no one is superior to Him and that no one is equal to Him. In
the Viṣṇu-mantra it is said that one who considers the Supreme Lord Kṛṣṇa in the
same category with demigods—be they even Brahmā or Śiva—becomes at once an
atheist. If, however, one thoroughly studies the different descriptions of the
opulences and expansions of Kṛṣṇa’s energy, then one can understand without any
doubt the position of Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa and can fix his mind in the worship of
Kṛṣṇa without deviation. The Lord is all-pervading by the expansion of His
partial representation, the Supersoul, who enters into everything that is. Pure
devotees, therefore, concentrate their minds in Kṛṣṇa consciousness in full
devotional service; therefore they are always situated in the transcendental
position. Devotional service and worship of Kṛṣṇa are very clearly indicated in
this chapter in verses eight to eleven. That is the way of pure devotional
service. How one can attain the highest devotional perfection of association
with the Supreme Personality of Godhead has been thoroughly explained in this
chapter.</p>
