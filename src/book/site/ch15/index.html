<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The Blessed Lord said: There is a banyan tree which has its roots upward and its
branches down and whose leaves are the Vedic hymns. One who knows this tree is
the knower of the Vedas.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>After the discussion of the importance of bhakti-yoga, one may question, “What
about the Vedas?” It is explained in this chapter that the purpose of Vedic
study is to understand Kṛṣṇa. Therefore one who is in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, who
is engaged in devotional service, already knows the Vedas.</p>
<p>The entanglement of this material world is compared here to a banyan tree. For
one who is engaged in fruitive activities, there is no end to the banyan tree.
He wanders from one branch to another, to another, to another. The tree of this
material world has no end, and for one who is attached to this tree, there is no
possibility of liberation. The Vedic hymns, meant for elevating oneself, are
called the leaves of this tree. This tree’s roots grow upward because they begin
from where Brahmā is located, the topmost planet of this universe. If one can
understand this indestructible tree of illusion, then one can get out of it.</p>
<p>This process of extrication should be understood. In the previous chapters it
has been explained that there are many processes by which to get out of the
material entanglement. And, up to the Thirteenth Chapter, we have seen that
devotional service to the Supreme Lord is the best way. Now, the basic principle
of devotional service is detachment from material activities and attachment to
the transcendental service of the Lord. The process of breaking attachment to
the material world is discussed in the beginning of this chapter. The root of
this material existence grows upward. This means that it begins from the total
material substance, from the topmost planet of the universe. From there, the
whole universe is expanded, with so many branches, representing the various
planetary systems. The fruits represent the results of the living entities’
activities, namely, religion, economic development, sense gratification and
liberation.</p>
<p>Now, there is no ready experience in this world of a tree situated with its
branches down and its roots upward, but there is such a thing. That tree can be
found beside a reservoir of water. We can see that the trees on the bank reflect
upon the water with their branches down and roots up. In other words, the tree
of this material world is only a reflection of the real tree of the spiritual
world. This reflection of the spiritual world is situated on desire, just as the
tree’s reflection is situated on water. Desire is the cause of things’ being
situated in this reflected material light. One who wants to get out of this
material existence must know this tree thoroughly through analytical study. Then
he can cut off his relationship with it.</p>
<p>This tree, being the reflection of the real tree, is an exact replica.
Everything is there in the spiritual world. The impersonalists take Brahmā to be
the root of this material tree, and from the root, according to sāṅkhya
philosophy, come prakṛti, puruṣa, then the three guṇas, then the five gross
elements (pañca-mahābhūta), then the ten senses (daśendriya), mind, etc. In this
way they divide up the whole material world. If Brahmā is the center of all
manifestations, then this material world is a manifestation of the center by 180
degrees, and the other 180 degrees constitute the spiritual world. The material
world is the perverted reflection, so the spiritual world must have the same
variegatedness, but in reality. The prakṛti is the external energy of the
Supreme Lord, and the puruṣa is the Supreme Lord Himself, and that is explained
in Bhagavad-gītā. Since this manifestation is material, it is temporary. A
reflection is temporary, for it is sometimes seen and sometimes not seen. But
the origin from whence the reflection is reflected is eternal. The material
reflection of the real tree has to be cut off. When it is said that a person
knows the Vedas, it is assumed that he knows how to cut off attachment to this
material world. If one knows that process, he actually knows the Vedas. One who
is attracted by the ritualistic formulas of the Vedas is attracted by the
beautiful green leaves of the tree. He does not exactly know the purpose of the
Vedas. The purpose of the Vedas, as disclosed by the Personality of Godhead
Himself, is to cut down this reflected tree and attain the real tree of the
spiritual world.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The branches of this tree extend downward and upward, nourished by the three
modes of material nature. The twigs are the objects of the senses. This tree
also has roots going down, and these are bound to the fruitive actions of human
society.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The description of the banyan tree is further explained here. Its branches are
spread in all directions. In the lower parts, there are variegated
manifestations of living entities, such as human beings, animals, horses, cows,
dogs, cats, etc. These are situated on the lower parts of the branches, whereas
on the upper parts are higher forms of living entities: the demigods, Gandharvas
(fairies), and many other higher species of life. As a tree is nourished by
water, so this tree is nourished by the three modes of material nature.
Sometimes we find that a tract of land is barren for want of sufficient water,
and sometimes a tract is very green; similarly, where the modes of material
nature are proportionately greater in quantity, the different species of life
are manifested in that proportion.</p>
<p>The twigs of the tree are considered to be the sense objects. By development of
the different modes of nature, we develop different senses, and, by the senses,
we enjoy different varieties of sense objects. The source of the senses—the
ears, the nose, eyes, etc.—is considered to be the upper twigs, tuned to the
enjoyment of different sense objects. The leaves are sound, form, touch—the
sense objects. The roots, which are subsidiary, are the by-products of different
varieties of suffering and sense enjoyment. Thus we develop attachment and
aversion. The tendencies toward piety and impiety are considered to be the
secondary roots, spreading in all directions. The real root is from Brahmaloka,
and the other roots are in the human planetary systems. After one enjoys the
results of virtuous activities in the upper planetary systems, he comes down to
this earth and renews his karma or fruitive activities for promotion. This
planet of human beings is considered the field of activities.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The real form of this tree cannot be perceived in this world. No one can
understand where it ends, where it begins, or where its foundation is. But with
determination one must cut down this tree with the weapon of detachment. So
doing, one must seek that place from which, having once gone, one never returns,
and there surrender to that Supreme Personality of Godhead from whom everything
has begun and in whom everything is abiding since time immemorial.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>It is now clearly stated that the real form of this banyan tree cannot be
understood in this material world. Since the root is upwards, the extension of
the real tree is at the other end. No one can see how far the tree extends, nor
can one see the beginning of this tree. Yet one has to find out the cause. “I am
the son of my father, my father is the son of such and such a person, etc.” By
searching in this way, one comes to Brahmā, who is generated by the
Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu. Finally, in this way, when one reaches to the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, that is the end of research work. One has to search out
that origin of this tree, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, through the
association of persons who are in the knowledge of that Supreme Personality of
Godhead. Then by understanding one becomes gradually detached from this false
reflection of reality, and by knowledge one can cut off the connection and
actually become situated in the real tree.</p>
<p>The word asaṅga is very important in this connection because the attachment for
sense enjoyment and lording it over the material nature is very strong.
Therefore one must learn detachment by discussion of spiritual science based on
authoritative scriptures, and one must hear from persons who are actually in
knowledge. As a result of such discussion in the association of devotees, one
comes to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Then the first thing one must do is
surrender to Him. The description of that place whence going no one returns to
this false reflected tree is given here. The Supreme Personality of Godhead,
Kṛṣṇa, is the original root from whom everything has emanated. To gain favor of
that Personality of Godhead, one has only to surrender, and this is a result of
performing devotional service by hearing, chanting, etc. He is the cause of this
extension of this material world. This is already explained by the Lord Himself:
ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavaḥ. “I am the origin of everything.”</p>
<p>Therefore to get out of the entanglement of this strong banyan tree of material
life, one must surrender to Kṛṣṇa. As soon as one surrenders unto Kṛṣṇa, he
becomes detached automatically from this material extension.</p>

<p>One who is free from illusion, false prestige, and false association, who
understands the eternal, who is done with material lust and is freed from the
duality of happiness and distress, and who knows how to surrender unto the
Supreme Person, attains to that eternal kingdom.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The surrendering process is described here very nicely. The first qualification
is that one should not be deluded by pride. Because the conditioned soul is
puffed up, thinking himself the lord of material nature, it is very difficult
for him to surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One should know by
the cultivation of real knowledge that he is not lord of material nature; the
Supreme Personality of Godhead is the Lord. When one is free from delusion
caused by pride, he can begin the process of surrender. For one who is always
expecting some honor in this material world, it is not possible to surrender to
the Supreme Person. Pride is due to illusion, for although one comes here, stays
for a brief time and then goes away, he has the foolish notion that he is the
lord of the world. He thus makes all things complicated, and he is always in
trouble. The whole world moves under this impression. People are considering
that the land, this earth, belongs to human society, and they have divided the
land under the false impression that they are the proprietors. One has to get
out of this false notion that human society is the proprietor of this world.
When one is freed from such a false notion, he becomes free from all the false
associations caused by familial, social, and national affections. These fake
associations bind one to this material world. After this stage, one has to
develop spiritual knowledge. One has to cultivate knowledge of what is actually
his own and what is actually not his own. And, when one has an understanding of
things as they are, he becomes free from all dual conceptions such as happiness
and distress, pleasure and pain. He becomes full in knowledge; then it is
possible for him to surrender to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>That abode of Mine is not illumined by the sun or moon, nor by electricity. One
who reaches it never returns to this material world.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The spiritual world, the abode of the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
Kṛṣṇa—which is known as Kṛṣṇaloka, Goloka Vṛndāvana—is described here. In the
spiritual sky there is no need of sunshine, moonshine, fire or electricity,
because all the planets are self-luminous. We have only one planet in this
universe, the sun, which is self-luminous, but all the planets in the spiritual
sky are self-luminous. The shining effulgence of all those planets (called
Vaikuṇṭhas) constitutes the shining sky known as the brahmajyoti. Actually, the
effulgence is emanating from the planet of Kṛṣṇa, Goloka Vṛndāvana. Part of that
shining effulgence is covered by the mahat-tattva, the material world. Other
than this, the major portion of that shining sky is full of spiritual planets,
which are called Vaikuṇṭhas, chief of which is Goloka Vṛndāvana.</p>
<p>As long as a living entity is in this dark material world, he is in conditional
life, but as soon as he reaches the spiritual sky, by cutting through the false,
perverted tree of this material world, he becomes liberated. Then there is no
chance of his coming back here. In his conditional life, the living entity
considers himself to be the lord of this material world, but in his liberated
state he enters into the spiritual kingdom and becomes the associate of the
Supreme Lord. There he enjoys eternal bliss, eternal life, and full knowledge.</p>
<p>One should be captivated by this information. He should desire to transfer
himself to that eternal world and extricate himself from this false reflection
of reality. For one who is too much attached to this material world, it is very
difficult to cut that attachment, but if he takes to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, there
is a chance of gradually becoming detached. One has to associate himself with
devotees, those who are in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. One should search out a society
dedicated to Kṛṣṇa consciousness and learn how to discharge devotional service.
In this way he can cut off his attachment to the material world. One cannot
become detached from the attraction of the material world simply by dressing
himself in saffron cloth. He must become attached to the devotional service of
the Lord. Therefore one should take it very seriously that devotional service as
described in the Twelfth Chapter is the only way to get out of this false
representation of the real tree. In Chapter Fourteen the contamination of all
kinds of processes by material nature is described. Only devotional service is
described as purely transcendental.</p>
<p>The words paramaṁ mama are very important here. Actually every nook and corner
is the property of the Supreme Lord, but the spiritual world is paramam, full of
six opulences. In the Upaniṣads it is also confirmed that in the spiritual world
there is no need of sunshine or moonshine, for the whole spiritual sky is
illuminated by the internal potency of the Supreme Lord. That supreme abode can
be achieved only by surrender and by no other means.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The living entities in this conditioned world are My eternal, fragmental parts.
Due to conditioned life, they are struggling very hard with the six senses,
which include the mind.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In this verse the identity of the living being is clearly given. The living
entity is the fragmental part and parcel of the Supreme Lord—eternally. It is
not that he assumes individuality in his conditional life and in his liberated
state becomes one with the Supreme Lord. He is eternally fragmented. It is
clearly said, sanātanaḥ. According to the Vedic version, the Supreme Lord
manifests and expands Himself in innumerable expansions, of which the primary
expansions are called Viṣṇu-tattva, and the secondary expansions are called the
living entities. In other words, the Viṣṇu-tattva is the personal expansion, and
the living entities are separated expansions. By His personal expansion, He is
manifested in various forms like Lord Rāma, Nṛsiṁhadeva, Viṣṇumūrti and all the
predominating Deities in the Vaikuṇṭha planets. The separated expansions, the
living entities, are eternally servitors. The personal expansions of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, the individual identities of the Godhead, are always
present. Similarly, the separated expansions of living entities have their
identities. As fragmental parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord, the living
entities have also fragmental qualities, of which independence is one. Every
living entity has an individual soul, his personal individuality and a minute
form of independence. By misuse of that independence, one becomes a conditioned
soul, and by proper use of independence he is always liberated. In either case,
he is qualititatively eternal, as the Supreme Lord is. In his liberated state he
is freed from this material condition, and he is under the engagement of
transcendental service unto the Lord; in his conditioned life he is dominated by
the material modes of nature, and he forgets the transcendental loving service
of the Lord. As a result, he has to struggle very hard to maintain his existence
in the material world.</p>
<p>The living entities, not only the human beings and the cats and dogs, but even
the greater controllers of the material world—Brahmā, Lord Śiva, and even
Viṣṇu—are all parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord. They are all eternal, not
temporary manifestations. The word karṣati (struggling or grappling hard) is
very significant. The conditioned soul is bound up, as though shackled by iron
chains. He is bound up by the false ego, and the mind is the chief agent which
is driving him in this material existence. When the mind is in the mode of
goodness, his activities are good; when the mind is in the mode of passion, his
activities are troublesome; and when the mind is in the mode of ignorance, he
travels in the lower species of life. It is clear, however, in this verse, that
the conditioned soul is covered by the material body, with the mind and the
senses, and when he is liberated this material covering perishes, but his
spiritual body manifests in its individual capacity. The following information
is there in the Mādhyandi-nāyana-śruti: sa vā eṣa brahma-niṣṭha idaṁ sarīraṁ
marttyam atisṛjya brahmābhisampadya brahmaṇā paśyati brahmaṇā śṛnoti
brahmaṇaivedaṁ sarvam anubhavati. It is stated here that when a living entity
gives up this material embodiment and enters into the spiritual world, he
revives his spiritual body, and in his spiritual body he can see the Supreme
Personality of Godhead face to face. He can hear and speak to Him face to face,
and he can understand the Supreme Personality as He is. In smṛti also it is
understood that in the spiritual planets everyone lives in bodies featured like
the Supreme Personality of Godhead’s. As far as bodily construction is
concerned, there is no difference between the part and parcel living entities
and the expansions of Viṣṇumūrti. In other words, at liberation the living
entity gets a spiritual body by the grace of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>The word mamaivāṁśaḥ (fragmental parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord) is also
very significant. The fragmental portion of the Supreme Lord is not like some
material broken part. We have already understood in the Second Chapter that the
spirit cannot be cut into pieces. This fragment is not materially conceived. It
is not like matter which can be cut into pieces and joined together again. That
conception is not applicable here because the Sanskrit word sanātana (eternal)
is used. The fragmental portion is eternal. It is also stated in the beginning
of the Second Chapter that (dehino ’smin yathā) in each and every individual
body, the fragmental portion of the Supreme Lord is present. That fragmental
portion, when liberated from the bodily entanglement, revives its original
spiritual body in the spiritual sky in a spiritual planet and enjoys association
with the Supreme Lord. It is, however, understood here that the living entity,
being the fragmental part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, is qualitatively one,
just as the parts and parcels of gold are also gold.</p>

<p>The living entity in the material world carries his different conceptions of
life from one body to another as the air carries aromas.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Here the living entity is described as īśvara, the controller of his own body.
If he likes, he can change his body to a higher grade, and if he likes he can
move to a lower class. Minute independence is there. The change his body
undergoes depends upon him. At the time of death, the consciousness he has
created will carry him on to the next type of body. If he has made his
consciousness like that of a cat or dog, he is sure to change to a cat’s or
dog’s body. And, if he has fixed his consciousness on godly qualities, he will
change into the form of a demigod. And, if he is in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he will
be transferred to Kṛṣṇaloka in the spiritual world and will associate with
Kṛṣṇa. It is a false claim that after the annihilation of this body everything
is finished. The individual soul is transmigrating from one body to another, and
his present body and present activities are the background of his next body. One
gets a different body according to karma, and he has to quit this body in due
course. It is stated here that the subtle body, which carries the conception of
the next body, develops another body in the next life. This process of
transmigrating from one body to another and struggling while in the body is
called karṣati or struggle for existence.</p>

<p>In other words, if the living entity adulterates his consciousness with the
qualities of cats and dogs, in his next life he gets a cat or dog body and
enjoys. Consciousness is originally pure, like water. But if we mix water with a
certain color, it changes. Similarly, consciousness is pure, for the spirit soul
is pure. But consciousness is changed according to the association of the
material qualities. Real consciousness is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. When, therefore,
one is situated in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he is in his pure life. But if his
consciousness is adulterated by some type of material mentality, in the next
life he gets a corresponding body. He does not necessarily get a human body
again; he can get the body of a cat, dog, hog, demigod or one of many other
forms, for there are 8,400,000 species.</p>

<p>The foolish cannot understand how a living entity can quit his body, nor can
they understand what sort of body he enjoys under the spell of the modes of
nature. But one whose eyes are trained in knowledge can see all this.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The word jñāna-cakṣuṣaḥ is very significant. Without knowledge, one cannot
understand how a living entity leaves his present body, nor what form of body he
is going to take in the next life, nor even why he is living in a particular
type of body. This requires a great amount of knowledge understood from
Bhagavad-gītā and similar literatures heard from a bona fide spiritual master.
One who is trained to perceive all these things is fortunate. Every living
entity is quitting his body under certain circumstances; he is living under
certain circumstances and enjoying under certain circumstances under the spell
of material nature. As a result, he is suffering different kinds of happiness
and distress, under the illusion of sense enjoyment. Persons who are
everlastingly fooled by lust and desire lose all power of understanding their
change of body and their stay in a particular body. They cannot comprehend it.
Those who have developed spiritual knowledge, however, can see that the spirit
is different from the body and is changing its body and enjoying in different
ways. A person in such knowledge can understand how the conditioned living
entity is suffering in this material existence. Therefore those who are highly
developed in Kṛṣṇa consciousness try their best to give this knowledge to the
people in general, for their conditional life is very much troublesome. They
should come out of it and be Kṛṣṇa conscious and liberate themselves to transfer
to the spiritual world.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>There are many transcendentalists in the path of spiritual self-realization, but
one who is not situated in self-realization cannot see how things are changing
in the body of the living entity. The word yoginaḥ is significant in this
connection. In the present day there are many so-called yogīs, and there are
many so-called associations of yogīs, but they are actually blind in the matter
of self-realization. They are simply addicted to some sort of gymnastic exercise
and are satisfied if the body is well-built and healthy. They have no other
information. They are called yatanto ’py akṛtātmānaḥ. Even though they are
endeavoring in a so-called yoga system, they are not self-realized. Such people
cannot understand the process of the transmigration of the soul. Only those who
are actually in the yoga system and have realized the self, the world, and the
Supreme Lord, in other words, the bhakti-yogīs, those engaged in pure devotional
service in Krsṇa consciousness, can understand how things are taking place.</p>

<p>The splendor of the sun, which dissipates the darkness of this whole world,
comes from Me. And the splendor of the moon and the splendor of fire are also
from Me.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The unintelligent cannot understand how things are taking place. The beginning
of knowledge can be established by understanding what the Lord explains here.
Everyone sees the sun, moon, fire and electricity. One should simply try to
understand that the splendor of the sun, the splendor of the moon, and the
splendor of electricity or fire are coming from the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. In such a conception of life, the beginning of Kṛṣṇa consciousness,
lies a great deal of advancement for the conditioned soul in this material
world. The living entities are essentially the parts and parcels of the Supreme
Lord, and He is giving herewith the hint how they can come back to Godhead, back
to home. From this verse we can understand that the sun is illuminating the
whole solar system. There are different universes and solar systems, and there
are different suns, moons and planets also. Sunlight is due to the spiritual
effulgence in the spiritual sky of the Supreme Lord. With the rise of the sun,
the activities of human beings are set up. They set fire to prepare their
foodstuff; they set fire to start the factories, etc. So many things are done
with the help of fire. Therefore sunrise, fire and moonlight are so pleasing to
the living entities. Without their help no living entity can live. So if one can
understand that the light and splendor of the sun, moon and fire are emanating
from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, then one’s Kṛṣṇa consciousness
will begin. By the moonshine, all the vegetables are nourished. The moonshine is
so pleasing that people can easily understand that they are living by the mercy
of the Supreme Personality of Godhead Kṛṣṇa. Without His mercy there cannot be
sun, without His mercy there cannot be moon, and without His mercy there cannot
be fire, and without the help of sun, moon and fire, no one can live. These are
some thoughts to provoke Kṛṣṇa consciousness in the conditioned soul.</p>

<p>I enter into each planet, and by My energy they stay in orbit. I become the moon

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>It is understood that all the planets are floating in the air only by the energy
of the Lord. The Lord enters into every atom, every planet, and every living
being. That is discussed in the Brahmā-saṁhitā. It is said there that one
plenary portion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Paramātmā, enters into
the planets, the universe, the living entity, and even into the atom. So due to
His entrance, everything is appropriately manifested. When the spirit soul is
there, a living man can float on the water, but when the living spark is out of
the body and the body is dead, it sinks. Of course when it is decomposed it
floats just like straw and other things, but as soon as the man is dead, he at
once sinks in the water. Similarly, all these planets are floating in space, and
this is due to the entrance of the supreme energy of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. His energy is sustaining each planet, just like a handful of dust. If
someone holds a handful of dust, there is no possibility of the dust falling,
but if one throws it in the air, it will fall down. Similarly, these planets,
which are floating in air, are actually held in the fist of the universal form
of the Supreme Lord. By His strength and energy, all moving and unmoving things
stay in their place. It is said that because of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, the sun is shining and the planets are steadily moving. Were it not for
Him, all the planets would scatter, like dust in air, and perish. Similarly, it
is due to the Supreme Personality of Godhead that the moon nourishes all
vegetables. Due to the moon’s influence, the vegetables become delicious.
Without the moonshine, the vegetables can neither grow nor taste succulent.
Human society is working, living comfortably and enjoying food due to the supply
from the Supreme Lord. Otherwise, mankind could not survive. The word rasātmakaḥ
is very significant. Everything becomes palatable by the agency of the Supreme
Lord through the influence of the moon.</p>

<p>I am the fire of digestion in every living body, and I am the air of life,
outgoing and incoming, by which I digest the four kinds of foodstuff.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>According to Āyur-vedic śāstra, we understand that there is a fire in the
stomach which digests all food sent there. When the fire is not blazing, there
is no hunger, and when the fire is in order, we become hungry. Sometimes when
the fire is not going nicely, treatment is required. In any case, this fire is
representative of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Vedic mantras also confirm
that the Supreme Lord or Brahman is situated in the form of fire within the
stomach and is digesting all kinds of foodstuff. Therefore since He is helping
the digestion of all kinds of foodstuff, the living entity is not independant in
the eating process. Unless the Supreme Lord helps him in digesting, there is no
possibility of eating. He thus produces and digests foodstuff, and, by His
grace, we are enjoying life. In the Vedānta-sūtra this is also confirmed:
śabdādibhyo ’ntaḥ pratiṣṭhānāc ca. The Lord is situated within sound and within
the body, within the air and even within the stomach as the digestive force.
There are four kinds of foodstuff: some are swallowed, some are chewed, some are
licked up, and some are sucked, and He is the digestive force for all of them.</p>

<p>I am seated in everyone’s heart, and from Me come remembrance, knowledge and
forgetfulness. By all the Vedas am I to be known; indeed I am the compiler of
Vedānta, and I am the knower of the Vedas.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Lord is situated as Paramātmā in everyone’s heart, and it is from
Him that all activities are initiated. The living entity forgets everything of
his past life, but he has to act according to the direction of the Supreme Lord,
who is witness to all his work. Therefore he begins his work according to his
past deeds. Required knowledge is supplied to him, and remembrance is given to
him, and he forgets, also, about his past life. Thus, the Lord is not only
all-pervading; He is also localized in every individual heart. He awards the
different fruitive results. He is not only worshipable as the impersonal
Brahman, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and the localized Paramātmā, but as
the form of the incarnation of the Vedas as well. The Vedas give the right
direction to the people so that they can properly mold their lives and come back
to Godhead, back to home. The Vedas offer knowledge of the Supreme Personality
of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, and Kṛṣṇa in His incarnation as Vyāsadeva is the compiler of
the Vedānta-sūtra. The commentation on the Vedānta-sūtra by Vyāsadeva in the
Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam gives the real understanding of Vedānta-sūtra. The Supreme
Lord is so full that for the deliverance of the conditioned soul He is the
supplier and digester of foodstuff, the witness of his activity, the giver of
knowledge in the form of Vedas and as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Śrī
Kṛṣṇa, the teacher of the Bhagavad-gītā. He is worshipable by the conditioned
soul. Thus God is all-good; God is all-merciful.</p>
<p>Antaḥpraviṣṭaḥ śāstā janānām. The living entity forgets as soon as he quits his
present body, but he begins his work again, initiated by the Supreme Lord.
Although he forgets, the Lord gives him the intelligence to renew his work where
he ended his last life. So not only does a living entity enjoy or suffer in this
world according to the dictation from the Supreme Lord situated locally in the
heart, but he receives the opportunity to understand Vedas from Him. If one is
serious to understand the Vedic knowledge, then Kṛṣṇa gives the required
intelligence. Why does He present the Vedic knowledge for understanding? Because
a living entity individually needs to understand Kṛṣṇa. Vedic literature
confirms this: yo ’sau sarvair vedair gīyate. In all Vedic literature, beginning
from the four Vedas, Vedānta-sūtra and the Upaniṣads and Purāṇas, the glories of
the Supreme Lord are celebrated. By performing Vedic rituals, discussing the
Vedic philosophy and worshiping the Lord in devotional service, He is attained.
Therefore the purpose of the Vedas is to understand Kṛṣṇa. The Vedas give us
direction to understand Kṛṣṇa and the process of understanding. The ultimate
goal is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Vedānta-sūtra confirms this in the
following words: tat tu samanvayāt. One can attain perfection by understanding
Vedic literature, and one can understand his relationship with the Supreme
Personality of Godhead by performing the different processes. Thus one can
approach Him and at the end attain the supreme goal, who is no other than the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. In this verse, however, the purpose of the
Vedas, the understanding of the Vedas and the goal of Vedas are clearly defined.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>There are two classes of beings, the fallible and the infallible. In the
material world every entity is fallible, and in the spiritual world every entity
is called infallible.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>As already explained, the Lord in His incarnation as Vyāsadeva compiled the
Vedānta-sutra. Here the Lord is giving, in summary, the contents of the
Vedānta-sūtra: He says that the living entities, who are innumerable, can be
divided into two classes—the fallible and the infallible. The living entities
are eternally separated parts and parcels of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
When they are in contact with the material world, they are called jīva-bhūtāḥ,
and the Sanskrit words given here, sarvāṇi bhūtāni mean that they are fallible.
Those who are in oneness with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, however, are
called infallible. Oneness does not mean that they have no individuality, but
that there is no disunity. They are all agreeable to the purpose of the
creation. Of course, in the spiritual world, there is no such thing as creation,
but since the Supreme Personality of Godhead has stated in the Vedānta-sūtra
that He is the source of all emanations, that conception is explained.</p>
<p>According to the statement of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Kṛṣṇa,
there are two classes of men. The Vedas give evidence of this, so there is no
doubt about it. The living entities, who are struggling in this world with the
mind and five senses, have their material bodies which are changing as long as
the living entities are conditioned. One’s body changes due to contact with
matter; matter is changing, so the living entity appears to be changing. But in
the spiritual world the body is not made of matter; therefore there is no
change. In the material world the living entity undergoes six changes—birth,
growth, duration, reproduction, then dwindling and vanishing. These are the
changes of the material body. But in the spiritual world the body does not
change; there is no old age, there is no birth, there is no death. There all
exists in oneness. It is more clearly explained as sarvāṇi bhūtāni: any living
entity who has come in contact with matter, beginning from the first created
being, Brahmā, down to a small ant, is changing its body; therefore they are all
fallible. In the spiritual world, however, they are always liberated in oneness.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Besides these two, there is the greatest living personality, the Lord Himself,
who has entered into these worlds and is maintaining them.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>This verse is very nicely expressed in the Kaṭha Upaniṣad and Śvetāśvatara
Upaniṣad. It is clearly stated there that above the innumerable living entities,
some of whom are conditioned and some of whom are liberated, there is the
Supreme Personality who is Paramātmā. The Upanisadic verse runs as follows:
nityo nityānāṁ cetanaś cetanānām. The purport is that amongst all the living
entities, both conditioned and liberated, there is one supreme living
personality, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who maintains them and gives
them all the facility of enjoyment according to different work. That Supreme
Personality of Godhead is situated in everyone’s heart as Paramātmā. A wise man
who can understand Him is eligible to attain the perfect peace, not others.</p>
<p>It is incorrect to think of the Supreme Lord and the living entities as being on
the same level or equal in all respects. There is always the question of
superiority and inferiority in their personalities. This particular word uttama
is very significant. No one can surpass the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Loke
is also significant because in the Pauruṣa, a Vedic literature, it is stated:
lokyate vedārtho ’nena. This Supreme Lord in His localized aspect as Paramātmā
explains the purpose of the Vedas. The following verse also appears in the
Vedas:</p>
<p>tāvad eṣa samprasādo ’smāc charīrāt samutthāya paraṁ jyoti-rūpaṁ sampadya svena
rūpeṇābhiniṣpadyate sa uttamaḥ puruṣaḥ</p>
<p>“The Supersoul coming out of the body enters the impersonal brahmajyoti; then in
His form He remains in His spiritual identity. That Supreme is called the
Supreme Personality.” This means that the Supreme Personality is exhibiting and
diffusing His spiritual effulgence, which is the ultimate illumination. That
Supreme Personality also has a localized aspect as Paramātmā. By incarnating
Himself as the son of Satyavatī and Parāśara, He explains the Vedic knowledge as
Vyāsadeva.</p>

conditioned soul nor the liberated soul. He is, therefore, the greatest of
personalities. Now it is clear here that the living entities and the Supreme
Personality of Godhead are individuals. The difference is that the living
entities, either in the conditioned state or in the liberated state, cannot
surpass in quantity the inconceivable potencies of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead.</p>

<p>Whoever knows Me as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, without doubting, is to

full devotional service, O son of Bharata</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>There are many philosophical speculations about the constitutional position of
the living entities and the Supreme Absolute Truth. Now in this verse the
Supreme Personality of Godhead clearly explains that anyone who knows Lord Kṛṣṇa
as the Supreme Person is actually the knower of everything. The imperfect knower
goes on simply speculating about the Absolute Truth, but the perfect knower,
without wasting his valuable time, engages directly in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, the
devotional service of the Supreme Lord. Throughout the whole of Bhagavad-gītā,
this fact is being stressed at every step. And still there are so many stubborn
commentators on Bhagavad-gītā who consider the Supreme Absolute Truth and the
living entities to be one and the same.</p>
<p>Vedic knowledge is called śruti learning by aural reception. One should actually
receive the Vedic message from authorities like Kṛṣṇa and His representatives.
Here Kṛṣṇa distinguishes everything very nicely, and one should hear from this
source. Simply to hear like the hogs is not sufficient; one must be able to
understand from the authorities. It is not that one should simply speculate
academically. One should submissively hear from Bhagavad-gītā that these living
entities are always subordinate to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Anyone
who is able to understand this, according to the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
Śrī Kṛṣṇa, knows the purpose of the Vedas; no one else knows the purpose of the
Vedas.</p>
<p>The word bhajate is very significant. In many places the word bhajate is
expressed in relationship with the service of the Supreme Lord. If a person is
engaged in full Kṛṣṇa consciousness in devotional service of the Lord, it is to
be understood that he has understood all the Vedic knowledge. In the Vaiṣṇava
paramparā it is said that if one is engaged in the devotional service of Kṛṣṇa,
then there is no need for a spiritual process to understand the Supreme Absolute
Truth. He has already come to the post because he is engaged in the devotional
service of the Lord. He has ended all preliminary processes of understanding;
similarly, if anyone, after speculating for hundreds of thousands of lives, does
not come to the point that Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and that
one has to surrender there, all his speculation for so many years and lives is a
useless waste of time.</p>

<p>This is the most confidential part of the Vedic scriptures, O sinless one, and
it is disclosed now by Me. Whoever understands this will become wise, and his
endeavors will know perfection.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Lord clearly explains here that this is the substance of all revealed
scriptures. And one should understand this as it is given by the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. Thus one will become intelligent and perfect in
transcendental knowledge. In other words, by understanding this philosophy of
the Supreme Personality of Godhead and engaging in His transcendental service,
everyone can become freed from all contaminations of the modes of material
nature. Devotional service is a process of spiritual understanding. Wherever
devotional service exists, the material contamination cannot coexist. Devotional
service to the Lord and the Lord Himself are one and the same because they are
spiritual—the internal energy of the Supreme Lord. The Lord is said to be the
sun, and ignorance is called darkness. Where the sun is present, there is no
question of darkness. Therefore, whenever devotional service is present under
the proper guidance of a bona fide spiritual master, there is no question of
ignorance.</p>
<p>Everyone must take to this consciousness of Kṛṣṇa and engage in devotional
service to become intelligent and purified. Unless one comes to this position of
understanding Kṛṣṇa and engages in devotional service, however intelligent he
may be in the estimation of some common man, he is not perfectly intelligent.</p>
<p>The word anagha, by which Arjuna is addressed, is significant. Anagha, O sinless
one, means that unless one is free from all sinful reactions, it is very
difficult to understand Kṛṣṇa. One has to become free from all contamination,
all sinful activities; then he can understand. But devotional service is so pure
and potent that once one is engaged in devotional service he automatically comes
to the stage of sinlessness.</p>
<p>While performing devotional service in the association of pure devotees in full
Kṛṣṇa consciousness, there are certain things which require to be vanquished
altogether. The most important thing one has to surmount is weakness of the
heart. The first falldown is caused by the desire to lord it over material
nature. Thus one gives up the transcendental loving service of the Supreme Lord.
The second weakness of the heart is that as one increases the propensity of
lording it over material nature, he becomes attached to matter and the
possession of matter. The problems of material existence are due to these
weaknesses of the heart.</p>
