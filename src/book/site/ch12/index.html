bhaktāḥ—devotees; tvām—unto You; paryupāsate—properly worship; ye—those;
ca—also; api—again; akṣaram—beyond the senses; avyaktam—unmanifested; teśām—of

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Arjuna inquired: Which is considered to be more perfect: those who are properly
engaged in Your devotional service, or those who worship the impersonal Brahman,
the unmanifested?</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Kṛṣṇa has now explained about the personal, the impersonal and the universal and
has described all kinds of devotees and yogīs. Generally, the transcendentalists
can be divided into two classes. One is the impersonalist, and the other is the
personalist. The personalist devotee engages himself with all energy in the
service of the Supreme Lord. The impersonalist engages himself not directly in
the service of Kṛṣṇa but in meditation on the impersonal Brahman, the
unmanifested.</p>
<p>We find in this chapter that of the different processes for realization of the
Absolute Truth, bhakti-yoga, devotional service, is the highest. If one at all
desires to have the association of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, then he
must take to devotional service.</p>
<p>Those who worship the Supreme Lord directly by devotional service are called
personalists. Those who engage themselves in meditation on the impersonal
Brahman are called impersonalists. Arjuna is here questioning which position is
better. There are different ways to realize the Absolute Truth, but Kṛṣṇa
indicates in this chapter that bhakti-yoga, or devotional service to Him, is
highest of all. It is the most direct, and it is the easiest means for
association with the Godhead.</p>
<p>In the Second Chapter the Lord explains that a living entity is not the material
body but is a spiritual spark, a part of the Absolute Truth. In the Seventh
Chapter He speaks of the living entity as part and parcel of the supreme whole
and recommends that he transfer his attention fully to the whole. In the Eighth
Chapter it is stated that whoever thinks of Kṛṣṇa at the moment of death is at
once transferred to the spiritual sky, Kṛṣṇa’s abode. And at the end of the
Sixth Chapter the Lord says that out of all the yogīs, he who thinks of Kṛṣṇa
within himself is considered to be the most perfect. So throughout the Gītā
personal devotion to Kṛṣṇa is recommended as the highest form of spiritual
realization. Yet there are those who are still attracted to Kṛṣṇa’s impersonal
brahmajyoti effulgence, which is the all-pervasive aspect of the Absolute Truth
and which is unmanifest and beyond the reach of the senses. Arjuna would like to
know which of these two types of transcendentalists is more perfect in
knowledge. In other words, he is clarifying his own position because he is
attached to the personal form of Kṛṣṇa. He is not attached to the impersonal
Brahman. He wants to know whether his position is secure. The impersonal
manifestation, either in this material world or in the spiritual world of the
Supreme Lord, is a problem for meditation. Actually, one cannot perfectly
conceive of the impersonal feature of the Absolute Truth. Therefore Arjuna wants
to say, “What is the use of such a waste of time?” Arjuna experienced in the
Eleventh Chapter that to be attached to the personal form of Kṛṣṇa is best
because he could thus understand all other forms at the same time and there was
no disturbance to his love for Kṛṣṇa. This important question asked of Kṛṣṇa by
Arjuna will clarify the distinction between the impersonal and personal
conceptions of the Absolute Truth.</p>

<p>In answer to Arjuna’s question, Kṛṣṇa clearly says that he who concentrates upon
His personal form and who worships Him with faith and devotion is to be
considered most perfect in yoga. For one in such Kṛṣṇa consciousness there are
no material activities because everything is done by Kṛṣṇa. A pure devotee is
constantly engaged—sometimes he chants, sometimes he hears or reads books about
Kṛṣṇa, or sometimes he cooks prasādam or goes to the marketplace to purchase
something for Kṛṣṇa, or sometimes he washes the temple or the dishes—whatever he
does, he does not let a single moment pass without devoting his activities to
Kṛṣṇa Such action is in full samādhi.</p>

the welfare of all, at last achieve Me.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Those who do not directly worship the Supreme Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, but who attempt to
achieve the same goal by an indirect process, also ultimately achieve the
supreme goal, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, as is stated, “After many births the man of wisdom
seeks refuge in Me, knowing Vāsudeva is all.” When a person comes to full
knowledge after many births, he surrenders unto Lord Kṛṣṇa. If one approaches
the Godhead by the method mentioned in this verse, he has to control the senses,
render service to everyone and engage in the welfare of all beings. It is
inferred that one has to approach Lord Kṛṣṇa, otherwise there is no perfect
realization. Often there is much penance involved before one fully surrenders
unto Him.</p>
<p>In order to perceive the Supersoul within the individual soul, one has to cease
the sensual activities of seeing, hearing, tasting, working, etc. Then one comes
to understand that the Supreme Soul is present everywhere. Realizing this, one
envies no living entity—he sees no difference between man and animal because he
sees soul only, not the outer covering. But for the common man, this method of
impersonal realization is very difficult.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>For those whose minds are attached to the unmanifested, impersonal feature of
the Supreme, advancement is very troublesome. To make progrese in that
discipline is always difficult for those who are embodied.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The group of transcendentalists who follow the path of the inconceivable,
unmanifested, impersonal feature of the Supreme Lord are called jñāna-yogīs, and
persons who are in full Kṛṣṇa consciousness, engaged in devotional service to
the Lord, are called bhakti-yogīs. Now, here the difference between jñāna-yoga
and bhakti-yoga is definitely expressed. The process of jñāna-yoga, although
ultimately bringing one to the same goal, is very troublesome, whereas the path
of bhakti-yoga, the process of being in direct service to the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, is easier and is natural for the embodied soul. The
individual soul is embodied since time immemorial. It is very difficult for him
to simply theoretically understand that he is not the body. Therefore, the
bhakti-yogī accepts the Deity of Kṛṣṇa as worshipable because there is some
bodily conception fixed in the mind, which can thus be applied. Of course,
worship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His form within the temple is
not idol worship. There is evidence in the Vedic literature that worship may be
saguṇa and nirguṇa—of the Supreme possessing or not possessing attributes.
Worship of the Deity in the temple is saguṇa worship, for the Lord is
represented by material qualities. But the form of the Lord, though represented
by material qualities such as stone, wood, or oil paint, is not actually
material. That is the absolute nature of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>A crude example may be given here. We may find some mailboxes on the street, and
if we post our letters in those boxes, they will naturally go to their
destination without difficulty. But any old box, or an imitation, which we may
find somewhere, which is not authorized by the post office, will not do the
work. Similarly, God has an authorized representation in the Deity form, which
is called arca-vigraha. This arca-vigraha is an incarnation of the Supreme Lord.
God will accept service through that form. The Lord is omnipotent and
all-powerful; therefore, by His incarnation as arca-vigraha, He can accept the
services of the devotee, just to make it convenient for the man in conditioned
life.</p>
<p>So, for a devotee, there is no difficulty in approaching the Supreme immediately
and directly, but for those who are following the impersonal way to spiritual
realization, the path is difficult. They have to understand the unmanifested
representation of the Supreme through such Vedic literatures as the Upaniṣads,
and they have to learn the language, understand the nonperceptual feelings, and
they have to realize all these processes. This is not very easy for a common
man. A person in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, engaged in devotional service, simply by
the guidance of the bona fide spiritual master, simply by offering regulative
obeisances unto the Deity, simply by hearing the glories of the Lord, and simply
by eating the remnants of foodstuffs offered to the Lord, realizes the Supreme
Personality of Godhead very easily. There is no doubt that the impersonalists
are unnecessarily taking a troublesome path with the risk of not realizing the
Absolute Truth at the ultimate end. But the personalist, without any risk,
trouble, or difficulty, approaches the Supreme Personality directly. A similar
passage appears in Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. It is stated there that if one has to
ultimately surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead (This surrendering
process is called bhakti.), but instead takes the trouble to understand what is
Brahman and what is not Brahman and spends his whole life in that way, the
result is simply troublesome. Therefore it is advised here that one should not
take up this troublesome path of self-realization because there is uncertainty
in the ultimate result.</p>
<p>A living entity is eternally an individual soul, and if he wants to merge into
the spiritual whole, he may accomplish the realization of the eternal and
knowledgeable aspects of his original nature, but the blissful portion is not
realized. By the grace of some devotee, such a transcendentalist, highly learned
in the process of jñāna-yoga, may come to the point of bhakti-yoga, or
devotional service. At that time, long practice in impersonalism also becomes a
source of trouble, because he cannot give up the idea. Therefore an embodied
soul is always in difficulty with the unmanifest, both at the time of practice
and at the time of realization. Every living soul is partially independant, and
one should know for certain that this unmanifested realization is against the
nature of his spiritual blissful self. One should not take up this process. For
every individual living entity the process of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, which entails
full engagement in devotional service, is the best way. If one wants to ignore
this devotional service, there is the danger of turning to atheism. Thus this
process of centering attention on the unmanifested, the inconceivable, which is
beyond the approach of the senses, as already expressed in this verse, should
never be encouraged at any time, especially in this age. It is not advised by
Lord Kṛṣṇa.</p>

<p>For one who worships Me, giving up all his activities unto Me and being devoted
to Me without deviation, engaged in devotional service and always meditating
upon Me, who has fixed his mind upon Me, O son of Pṛthā, for him I am the swift
deliverer from the ocean of birth and death.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>It is explicitly stated here that the devotees are very fortunate to be
delivered very soon from material existence by the Lord. In pure devotional
service one comes to the realization that God is great and that the individual
soul is subordinate to Him. His duty is to render service to the Lord—if not,
then he will render service to māyā.</p>
<p>As stated before, the Supreme Lord can only be appreciated by devotional
service. Therefore, one should be fully devoted. One should fix his mind fully
on Kṛṣṇa in order to achieve Him. One should work only for Kṛṣṇa. It does not
matter in what kind of work one engages, but that work should be done only for
Kṛṣṇa. That is the standard of devotional service. The devotee does not desire
any achievement other than pleasing the Supreme Personality of Godhead. His
life’s mission is to please Kṛṣṇa, and he can sacrifice everything for Kṛṣṇa’s
satisfaction, just as Arjuna did in the Battle of Kurukṣetra. The process is
very simple: one can devote himself in his occupation and engage at the same
time in chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare
Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare. Such transcendental chanting attracts the devotee to
the Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>The Supreme Lord herein promises that He will without delay deliver a pure
devotee thus engaged from the ocean of material existence. Those who are
advanced in yoga practice can willfully transfer the soul to whatever planet
they like by the yoga process, and others take the opportunity in various ways,
but as far as the devotee is concerned, it is clearly stated here that the Lord
Himself takes him. He does not need to wait to become very experienced in order
to transfer himself to the spiritual sky.</p>
<p>In the Varāha Purāṇa this verse appears:</p>
<p>nayāmi paramaṁ sthānam arcirādi-gatiṁ vinā garuḍa-skandham āropya yatheccham
anivāritaḥ</p>
<p>The purport of this verse is that a devotee does not need to practice
aṣṭāṅga-yoga in order to transfer his soul to the spiritual planets. The
responsibility is taken by the Supreme Lord Himself. He clearly states here that
He Himself becomes the deliverer. A child is completely cared for by his
parents, and thus his position is secure. Similarly, a devotee does not need to
endeavor to transfer himself by yoga practice to other planets. Rather, the
Supreme Lord, by His great mercy, comes at once, riding on His bird carrier
Garuḍa, and at once delivers the devotee from this material existence. Although
a man who has fallen in the ocean may struggle very hard and may be very expert
in swimming, he cannot save himself. But if someone comes and picks him up from
the water, then he is easily rescued. Similarly, the Lord picks up the devotee
from this material existence. One simply has to practice the easy process of
Kṛṣṇa consciousness and fully engage himself in devotional service. Any
intelligent man should always prefer the process of devotional service to all
other paths. In the Nārāyaṇīya this is confirmed as follows:</p>
<p>yā vai sādhana-sampatti-puruṣārtha-catuṣṭaye tayā vinā tad-āpnoti naro
nārāyaṇāśrayaḥ</p>
<p>The purport of this verse is that one should not engage in the different
processes of fruitive activity or cultivate knowledge by the mental speculative
process. One who is devoted to the Supreme Personality can attain all the
benefits derived from other yogic processes, speculation, rituals, sacrifices,
charities, etc. That is the specific benediction of devotional service.</p>
<p>Simply by chanting the holy name of Kṛṣṇa—Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa,
Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare—a devotee of the Lord can
approach the supreme destination easily and happily, but this destination cannot
be approached by any other process of religion.</p>
<p>The conclusion of Bhagavad-gītā is stated in the Eighteenth Chapter:</p>
<p>sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo
mokṣayiṣyāmi mā śucaḥ.</p>
<p>One should give up all other processes of self-realization and simply execute
devotional service in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That will enable one to reach the
highest perfection of life. There is no need for one to consider the sinful
actions of his past life because the Supreme Lord fully takes charge of him.
Therefore one should not futilely try to deliver himself in spiritual
realization. Let everyone take shelter of the supreme omnipotent Godhead Kṛṣṇa.
That is the highest perfection of life.</p>

<p>One who is engaged in Lord Kṛṣṇa’s devotional service lives in a direct
relationship with the Supreme Lord, so there is no doubt that his position is
transcendental from the very beginning. A devotee does not live on the material
plane—he lives in Kṛṣṇa. The holy name of the Lord and the Lord are
nondifferent; therefore when a devotee chants Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa and His internal
potency are dancing on the tongue of the devotee. When he offers Kṛṣṇa food,
Kṛṣṇa directly accepts these eatables, and the devotee becomes Kṛṣṇa-ized by
eating the remnants. One who does not engage in such service cannot understand
how this is so, although this is a process recommended in the Gītā and in other
Vedic literatures.</p>

<p>My dear Arjuna, O winner of wealth, if you cannot fix your mind upon Me without
deviation, then follow the regulated principles of bhakti-yoga In this way you
will develop a desire to attain to Me.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In this verse, two different processes of bhakti-yoga are indicated. The first
applies to one who has actually developed an attachment for Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, by transcendental love. And the other is for one who has
not developed an attachment for the Supreme Person by transcendental love. For
this second class there are different prescribed rules and regulations, which
one can follow to be ultimately elevated to the stage of attachment to Kṛṣṇa.</p>
<p>Bhakti-yoga is the purification of the senses. At the present moment in material
existence the senses are always impure, being engaged in sense gratification.
But, by the practice of bhakti-yoga these senses can become purified, and in the
purified state they come directly in contact with the Supreme Lord. In this
material existence, I may be engaged in some service to some master, but I don’t
really lovingly serve my master. I simply serve to get some money. And the
master also is not in love; he takes service from me and pays me. So there is no
question of love. But for spiritual life, one must be elevated to the pure stage
of love. That stage of love can be achieved by practice of devotional service,
performed with the present senses.</p>
<p>This love of God is now in a dormant state in everyone’s heart. And, there, love
of God is manifested in different ways, but it is contaminated by the material
association. Now the material association has to be purified, and that dormant,
natural love for Kṛṣṇa has to be revived. That is the whole process.</p>
<p>To practice the regulative principles of bhakti-yoga one should, under the
guidance of an expert spiritual master, follow certain principles: one should
rise early in the morning, take bath, enter the temple and offer prayers and
chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, then collect flowers to offer to the Deity, cook foodstuffs to
offer to the Deity, take prasādam, and so on. There are various rules and
regulations which one should follow. And one should constantly hear
Bhagavad-gītā and Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam from pure devotees. This practice can help
anyone to rise to the level of love of God, and then he is sure of his progress
into the spiritual kingdom of God. This practice of bhakti-yoga, under the rules
and regulations, with the direction of a spiritual master, will surely bring one
to the stage of love of God.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>One who is not able even to practice the regulative principles of bhakti-yoga,
under the guidance of a spiritual master, can still be drawn to this
perfectional stage by working for the Supreme Lord. How to do this work has
already been explained in the fifty-fifth verse of the Eleventh Chapter. One
should be sympathetic to the propagation of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. There are many
devotees who are engaged in the propagation of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and they
require help. So, even if one cannot directly practice the regulated principles
of bhakti-yoga, he can try to help such work. Every endeavor requires land,
capital, organization, and labor. Just as, in business, one requires a place to
stay, some capital to use, some labor, and some organization to expand, so the
same is required in the service of Kṛṣṇa. The only difference is that in
materialism one works for sense gratification. The same work, however, can be
performed for the satisfaction of Kṛṣṇa, and that is spiritual activity. If one
has sufficient money, he can help in building an office or temple for
propagating Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Or he can help with publications. There are
various fields of activity, and one should be interested in such activities. If
one cannot sacrifice the result of such activities, the same person can still
sacrifice some percentage to propagate Kṛṣṇa consciousness. This voluntary
service to the cause of Kṛṣṇa consciousness will help one to rise to a higher
state of love for God, whereupon one becomes perfect.</p>

<p>If, however, you are unable to work in this consciousness, then try to act

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>It may be that one is unable to even sympathize with the activities of Kṛṣṇa
consciousness because of social, familial or religious considerations or because
of some other impediments. If one attaches himself directly to the activities of
Kṛṣṇa consciousness, there may be objection from family members, or so many
other difficulties. For one who has such a problem, it is advised that he
sacrifice the accumulated result of his activities to some good cause. Such
procedures are described in the Vedic rules. There are many descriptions of
sacrifices and special functions of the pumundi or special work in which the
result of one’s previous action may be applied. Thus one may gradually become
elevated to the state of knowledge. It is also found that when one who is not
even interested in the activities of Kṛṣṇa consciousness gives charity to some
hospital or some other social institution, he gives up the hard-earned results
of his activities. That is also recommended here because by the practice of
giving up the fruits of one’s activities one is sure to purify his mind
gradually, and in that purified stage of mind one becomes able to understand
Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Of course Kṛṣṇa consciousness is not dependant on any other
experience because Kṛṣṇa consciousness itself can purify one’s mind, but if
there are impediments to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, one may try to give up the result
of his action. In that respect, social service, community service, national
service, sacrifice for one’s country, etc., may be accepted so that some day one
may come to the stage of pure devotional service to the Supreme Lord. In
Bhagavad-gītā we find it is stated: yataḥ pravṛttir bhūtānām: If one decides to
sacrifice for the supreme cause, even if he does not know that the supreme cause
is Kṛṣṇa, he will come gradually to understand that Kṛṣṇa is the supreme cause
by the sacrificial method.</p>

<p>If you cannot take to this practice, then engage yourself in the cultivation of

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>As mentioned in the previous verses, there are two kinds of devotional service:
the way of regulated principles, and the way of full attachment in love to the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. For those who are actually not able to follow
the principles of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, it is better to cultivate knowledge
because by knowledge one can be able to understand his real position. Gradually
knowledge will develop to the point of meditation. By meditation one can be able
to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead by a gradual process. There are
processes which make one understand that one himself is the Supreme, and that
sort of meditation is preferred if one is unable to engage in devotional
service. If one is not able to meditate in such a way, then there are prescribed
duties, as enjoined in the Vedic literature, for the brāhmaṇas, vaiśyas, and
śūdras, which we shall find in a later chapter of Bhagavad-gītā. But in all
cases, one should give up the result or fruits of labor; this means to employ
the result of karma for some good cause. In summary, to reach the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, the highest goal, there are two processes: one process
is by gradual development, and the other process is direct. Devotional service
in Kṛṣṇa consciousness is the direct method, and the other method involves
renouncing the fruits of one’s activities. Then one can come to the stage of
knowledge, then to the stage of meditation, then to the stage of understanding
the Supersoul, and then to the stage of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One
may either take the step by step process or the direct path. The direct process
is not possible for everyone; therefore the indirect process is also good. It
is, however, to be understood that the indirect process is not recommended for
Arjuna because he is already at the stage of loving devotional service to the
Supreme Lord. It is for others who are not at this state; for them the gradual
process of renunciation, knowledge, meditation and realization of the Supersoul
and Brahman should be followed. But as far as Bhagavad-gītā is concerned, it is
the direct method that is stressed. Everyone is advised to take to the direct
method and surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa.</p>

Me—he is very dear to Me.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Coming again to the point of pure devotional service, the Lord is describing the
transcendental qualifications of a pure devotee in these two verses. A pure
devotee is never disturbed in any circumstances. Nor is he envious of anyone.
Nor does a devotee become his enemy’s enemy; he thinks that one is acting as his
enemy due to his own past misdeeds. Thus it is better to suffer than to protest.
In the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam it is stated: tat te ’nukampāṁ su-samīkṣyamaṇo.
Whenever a devotee is in distress or has fallen into difficulty, he thinks that
it is the Lord’s mercy upon him. He thinks: “Thanks to my past misdeeds I should
suffer far, far greater than I am suffering now. So it is by the mercy of the
Supreme Lord that I am not getting all the punishment I am due. I am just
getting a little, by the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.” Therefore
he is always calm, quiet and patient, despite many distressful conditions. A
devotee is also always kind to everyone, even to his enemy. Nirmama means that a
devotee does not attach much importance to the peace and trouble pertaining to
the body because he knows perfectly well that he is not the material body. He
does not identify with the body; therefore he is freed from the conception of
false ego and is equiposed both in happiness and distress. He is tolerant, and
he is satisfied with whatever comes by the grace of the Supreme Lord. He does
not endeavor much to achieve something with great difficulty; therefore he is
always joyful. He is a completely perfect mystic because he is fixed in the
instructions received from the spiritual master, and because his senses are
controlled, he is determined. He is not swayed by false argument because no one
can lead him from the fixed determination of devotional service. He is fully
conscious that Kṛṣṇa is the eternal Lord, so no one can disturb him. All his
qualifications enable him to depend entirely on the Supreme Lord. Such a
standard of devotional service is undoubtably very rare, but a devotee becomes
situated in that stage by following the regulative principles of devotional
service. Furthermore, the Lord says that such a devotee is very dear to Him, for
the Lord is always pleased with all his activities in full Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</p>

<p>He for whom no one is put into difficulty and who is not dirturbed by anxiety,

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>A few of a devotee’s qualifications are further being described. No one is put
into difficulty, anxiety, fearfulness, or dissatisfaction by such a devotee.
Since a devotee is kind to everyone, he does not act in such a way to put others
into anxiety. At the same time, if others try to put a devotee into anxiety, he
is not disturbed. It is by the grace of the Lord that he is so practiced that he
is not disturbed by any outward disturbance. Actually because a devotee is
always engrossed in Kṛṣṇa consciousness and engaged in devotional service, all
such material circumstances cannot woo him. Generally a materialistic person
becomes very happy when there is something for his sense gratification and his
body, but when he sees that others have something for their sense gratification
and he hasn’t, he is sorry and envious. When he is expecting some retaliation
from an enemy, he is in a state of fear, and when he cannot successfully execute
something he becomes dejected. But a devotee is always transcendental to all
these disturbances; therefore he is very dear to Kṛṣṇa.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>A devotee who is not dependant on the ordinary course of activities, who is
pure, expert, without cares, free from all pains, and who does not strive for
some result, is very dear to Me.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Money may be offered to a devotee, but he should not struggle to acquire it. If
automatically, by the grace of the Supreme, money comes to him, he is not
agītāted. Naturally a devotee takes bath at least twice in a day and rises early
in the morning for devotional service. Thus he is naturally clean both inwardly
and outwardly. A devotee is always expert because he fully knows the sense of
all activities of life, and he is convinced of the authoritative scriptures. A
devotee never takes the part of a particular party; therefore he is carefree. He
is never pained because he is free from all designations; he knows that his body
is a designation, so if there are some bodily pains, he is free. The pure
devotee does not endeavor for anything which is against the principles of
devotional service. For example, constructing a big building requires great
energy, and a devotee does not take to such business if it does not benefit him
by advancing his devotional service. He may construct a temple for the Lord, and
for that he may take all kinds of anxiety, but he does not construct a big house
for his personal relations.</p>

<p>A pure devotee is neither happy nor distressed over material gain and loss, nor
is he very much anxious to get a son or disciple, nor is he distressed by not
getting them. If he loses anything which is very dear to him, he does not
lament. Similarly, if he does not get what he desires, he is not distressed. He
is transcendental in the face of all kinds of auspicious, inauspicious and
sinful activities. He is prepared to accept all kinds of risks for the
satisfaction of the Supreme Lord. Nothing is an impediment in the discharge of
his devotional service. Such a devotee is very dear to Kṛṣṇa.</p>

very dear to Me.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>A devotee is always free from all bad association. Sometimes one is praised and
sometimes one is defamed; that is the nature of human society. But a devotee is
always transcendental to artificial fame and infamy, distress or happiness. He
is very patient. He does not speak of anything but the topics about Kṛṣṇa;
therefore he is called silent. Silent does not mean that one should not speak;
silent means that one should not speak nonsense. One should speak only of
essentials, and the most essential speech for the devotee is to speak of the
Supreme Lord. He is happy in all conditions; sometimes he may get very palatable
foodstuffs, sometimes not, but he is satisfied. Nor does he care for any
residential facility. He may sometimes live underneath a tree, and he may
sometimes live in a very palatial building; he is attracted to neither. He is
called fixed because he is fixed in his determination and knowledge. We may find
some repetition in the descriptions of the qualifications of a devotee, but this
is just to give an illustration of the fact that a devotee must acquire all
these qualifications. Without good qualifications, one cannot be a pure devotee.
One who is not a devotee has no good qualification. One who wants to be
recognized as a devotee should develop the good qualifications. Of course he
does not extraneously endeavor to acquire these qualifications, but engagement
in Kṛṣṇa consciousness and devotional service automatically helps him develop
them.</p>

<p>He who follows this imperishable path of devotional service and who completely

Me.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In this chapter the religion of eternal engagement, the explanation of the
process of transcendental service for approaching the Supreme Lord, is given.
This process is very dear to the Lord, and He accepts a person who is engaged in
such a process. The question who is better—one who is engaged in the path of
impersonal Brahman or one who is engaged in the personal service of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead—was raised by Arjuna, and the Lord replied to him so
explicitly that there is no doubt that devotional service to the Personality of
Godhead is the best of all processes of spiritual realization. In other words,
in this chapter it is decided that through good association, one develops
attachment for pure devotional service and thereby accepts a bona fide spiritual
master and from him begins to hear and chant and observe the regulative
principles of devotional service with faith, attachment and devotion and thus
becomes engaged in the transcendental service of the Lord. This path is
recommended in this chapter; therefore there is no doubt that devotional service
is the only absolute path for self-realization, for the attainment of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. The impersonal conception of the Supreme
Absolute Truth, as described in this chapter, is recommended only up to the time
one surrenders himself for self-realization. In other words, as long as one does
not have the chance to associate with a pure devotee, the impersonal conception
may be beneficial. In the impersonal conception of the Absolute Truth one works
without fruitive result, meditates and cultivates knowledge to understand spirit
and matter. This is necessary as long as one is not in the association of a pure
devotee. Fortunately, if one develops directly a desire to engage in Kṛṣṇa
consciousness in pure devotional service, he does not need to undergo step by
step improvements in spiritual realization. Devotional service, as described in
the middle six chapters of Bhagavad-gītā, is more congenial. One need not bother
about materials to keep body and soul together because by the grace of the Lord
everything is carried out automatically.</p>
