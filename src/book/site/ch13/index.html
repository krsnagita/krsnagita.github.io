<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Arjuna said: O my dear Kṛṣṇa, I wish to know about prakṛti [nature], Puruṣa [the
enjoyer], and the field and the knower of the field, and of knowledge and the
end of knowledge. The Blessed Lord then said: This body, O son of Kuntī, is
called the field, and one who knows this body is called the knower of the field.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Arjuna was inquisitive about prakṛti or nature, puruṣa, the enjoyer, kṣetra, the
field, kṣetrajña, its knower, and of knowledge and the object of knowledge. When
he inquired about all these, Kṛṣṇa said that this body is called the field and
that one who knows this body is called the knower of the field. This body is the
field of activity for the conditioned soul. The conditioned soul is entrapped in
material existence, and he attempts to lord over material nature. And so,
according to his capacity to dominate material nature, he gets a field of
activity. That field of activity is the body. And what is the body? The body is
made of senses. The conditioned soul wants to enjoy sense gratification, and,
according to his capacity to enjoy sense gratification, he is offered a body, or
field of activity. Therefore the body is called kṣetra, or the field of activity
for the conditioned soul. Now, the person who does not identify himself with the
body is called kṣetrajña, the knower of the field. It is not very difficult to
understand the difference between the field and its knower, the body and the
knower of the body. Any person can consider that from childhood to old age he
undergoes so many changes of body and yet is still one person, remaining. Thus
there is a difference between the knower of the field of activities and the
actual field of activities. A living conditioned soul can thus understand that
he is different from the body. It is described in the beginning—dehe ’smin—that
the living entity is within the body and that the body is changing from
childhood to boyhood and from boyhood to youth and from youth to old age, and
the person who owns the body knows that the body is changing. The owner is
distinctly kṣetrajña. Sometimes we understand that I am happy, I am mad, I am a
woman, I am a dog, I am a cat: these are the knowers. The knower is different
from the field. Although we use many articles—our clothes, etc.—we know- that we
are different from the things used. Similarly, we also understand by a little
contemplation that we are different from the body.</p>
<p>In the first six chapters of Bhagavad-gītā, the knower of the body, the living
entity, and the position by which he can understand the Supreme Lord are
described. In the middle six chapters of the Gītā, the Supreme Personality of
Godhead and the relationship between the individual soul and the Supersoul in
regard to devotional service are described. The superior position of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead and the subordinate position of the individual soul are
definitely defined in these chapters. The living entities are subordinate under
all circumstances, but in their forgetfulness they are suffering. When
enlightened by pious activities, they approach the Supreme Lord in different
capacities—as the distressed, those in want of money, the inquisitive, and those
in search of knowledge. That is also described. Now, starting with the
Thirteenth Chapter, how the living entity comes into contact with material
nature, how he is delivered by the Supreme Lord through the different methods of
fruitive activities, cultivation of knowledge, and the discharge of devotional
service are explained. Although the living entity is completely different from
the material body, he somehow becomes related. This also is explained.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O scion of Bharata, you should understand that I am also the knower in all
bodies, and to understand this body and its owner is called knowledge. That is
My opinion.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>While discussing the subject of this body and the owner of the body, the soul
and the Supersoul, we shall find three different topics of study: the Lord, the
1iving entity, and matter. In every field of activities, in every body, there
are two souls: the individual soul and the Supersoul. Because the Supersoul is
the plenary expansion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa says,
“I am also the knower, but I am not the individual owner of the body. I am the
superknower. I am present in every body as the Paramātmā, or Supersoul.”</p>
<p>One who studies the subject matter of the field of activity and the knower of
the field very minutely, in terms of this Bhagavad-gītā, can attain to
knowledge.</p>
<p>The Lord says: “I am the knower of the field of activities in every individual
body.” The individual may be the knower of his own body, but he is not in
knowledge of other bodies. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is present as
the Supersoul in all bodies, knows everything about all bodies. He knows all the
different bodies of all the various species of life. A citizen may know
everything about his patch of land, but the king knows not only his palace but
all the properties possessed by the individual citizens. Similarly, one may be
the proprietor of the body individually, but the Supreme Lord is the proprietor
of all bodies. The king is the original proprietor of the kingdom, and the
citizen is the secondary proprietor. Similarly, the Supreme Lord is the supreme
proprietor of all bodies.</p>
<p>The body consists of the senses. The Supreme Lord is Hṛṣīkeśa, which means
controller of the senses. He is the original controller of the senses, just as
the king is the original controller of all the activities of the state, and the
citizens are secondary controllers. The Lord also says: “I am also the knower.”
This means that He is the superknower; the individual soul knows only his
particular body. In the Vedic literature, it is stated as follows:</p>
<p>kṣetrāṇi hi śarīrāṇi bījaṁ cāpi śubhāśubhe tāni vetti sa yogātmā tataḥ kṣetrajña
ucyate.</p>
<p>This body is called the kṣetra, and within it dwells the owner of the body and
the Supreme Lord who knows both the body and the owner of the body. Therefore He
is called the knower of all fields. The distinction between the field of
activities, the owner of activities and the supreme owner of activities is
described as follows. Perfect knowledge of the constitution of the body, the
constitution of the individual soul, and the constitution of the Supersoul is
known in terms of Vedic literature as jñānam. That is the opinion of Kṛṣṇa. To
understand both the soul and the Supersoul as one yet distinct is knowledge. One
who does not understand the field of activity and the knower of activity is not
in perfect knowledge. One has to understand the position of prakṛti, nature, and
puruṣa, the enjoyer of the nature, and īśvara, the knower who dominates or
controls nature and the individual soul. One should not confuse the three in
their different capacities. One should not confuse the painter, the painting and
the easel. This material world, which is the field of activities, is nature, and
the enjoyer of nature is the living entity, and above them both is the supreme
controller, the Personality of Godhead. It is stated in the Vedic language:
“bhoktā bhogyaṁ preritāraṁ ca matvā sarvaṁ proktaṁ tri-vidhaṁ brahmam etat.”
There are three Brahman conceptions: prakṛti is Brahman as the field of
activities, and the jīva (individual soul) is also Brahman and is trying to
control material nature, and the controller of both of them is also Brahman, but
He is the factual controller.</p>
<p>In this chapter it will be also explained that out of the two knowers, one is
fallible and the other is infallible. One is superior and the other is
subordinate. One who understands the two knowers of the field to be one and the
same contradicts the Supreme Personality of Godhead who states here very clearly
that “I am also the knower of the field of activity.” One who misunderstands a
rope to be a serpent is not in knowledge. There are different kinds of bodies,
and there are different owners of the bodies. Because each individual soul has
his individual capacity of lording it over material nature, there are different
bodies. But the Supreme also is present in them as the controller. The word ca
is significant, for it indicates the total number of bodies. That is the opinion
of Śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa: Kṛṣṇa is the Supersoul present in each and every
body apart from the individual soul. And Kṛṣṇa explicitly says here that the
Supersoul is the controller of both the field of activities and the finite
enjoyer.</p>

<p>Now please hear My brief description of this field of activity and how it is
constituted, what its changes are, whence it is produced, who that knower of the
field of activities is, and what his influences are.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Lord is describing the field of activities and the knower of the field of
activities in their constitutional positions. One has to know how this body is
constituted, the materials of which this body is made, under whose control this
body is working, how the changes are taking place, wherefrom the changes are
coming, what the causes are, what the reasons are, what the ultimate goal of the
individual is, and what the actual form of the individual soul is. One should
also know the distinction between the individual living soul and the Supersoul,
the different influences, their potentials, etc. One just has to understand this
Bhagavad-gītā directly from the description given by the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, and all this will be clarified. But one should be careful not to
consider the Supreme Personality of Godhead in every body and individual soul to
be the jīva. This is something like equalizing the potent and the impotent.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>That knowledge of the field of activities and of the knower of activities is
described by various sages in various Vedic writings—especially in the
Vedānta-sūtra—and is presented with all reasoning as to cause and effect.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, is the highest authority in
explaining this knowledge. Still, as a matter of course, learned scholars and
standard authorities always give evidence from previous authorities. Kṛṣṇa is
explaining this most controversial point regarding the duality and non-duality
of the soul and the Supersoul by referring to Scriptures, the Vedānta, which are
accepted as authority. First, He says, this is according to different sages. As
far as the sages are concerned, besides Himself, Vyāsadeva, the author of the
Vedānta-sūtra, is a great sage, and in the Vedānta-sūtra duality is perfectly
explained. And Vyāsadeva’s father, Parāśara, was also a great sage, and he
writes in his books of religiosity: “aham tvaṁ ca athānye…” “We—you, I and
various other living entities—are all transcendental, although in material
bodies. Now we are fallen into the ways of the three modes of material nature
according to our different karma. As such, some are on higher levels, and some
are in the lower nature. The higher and lower natures exist due to ignorance and
are being manifested in an infinite number of living entities. But the
Supersoul, which is infallible, is uncontaminated by the three qualities of
nature and is transcendental.” Similarly, in the original Vedas, a distinction
between the soul, the Supersoul and the body is made, especially in the Kaṭha
Upaniṣad.</p>
<p>There is a manifestation of the Supreme Lord’s energy known as annamaya by which
one depends simply upon food for existence. This is a materialistic realization
of the Supreme. Then there is prāṇamaya; this means that after realizing the
Supreme Absolute Truth in foodstuff, one can realize the Absolute Truth in the
living symptoms, or life forms. In jñānamaya the living symptom develops to the
point of thinking, feeling, and willing. Then there is Brahman realization and
the realization called vijñānamaya by which the living entity’s mind and life
symptoms are distinguished from the living entity himself. The next and supreme
stage is ānandamaya, realization of the all-blissful nature. Thus there are five
stages of Brahman realization, which is called brahma puccham. Out of these the
first three—annamaya, prāṇamaya, and jñānamaya—involve the fields of activities
of the living entities. Transcendental to all these fields of activities is the
Supreme Lord, who is called ānandamaya. In the Vedānta-sūtra also the Supreme is
called ānandamayo ’bhyāsāt. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is by nature full
of joy, and to enjoy His transcendental bliss, He expands into vijñānamaya,
prāṇamaya, jñānamaya, and annamaya. In this field of activities the living
entity is considered to be the enjoyer, and different from him is the
ānandamaya. That means that if the living entity decides to enjoy, in
dovetailing himself with the ānandamaya, then he becomes perfect. This is the
real picture of the Supreme Lord, as supreme knower of the field, the living
entity, as subordinate knower, and the nature of the field of activities.</p>

<p>The five great elements, false ego, intelligence, the unmanifested, the ten
senses, the mind, the five sense objects, desire, hatred, happiness, distress,
the aggregate, the life symptoms, and convictions—all these are considered, in
summary, to be the field of activities and its interactions.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>From all the authoritative statements of the great sages, the Vedic hymns and
the aphorisms of the Vedānta-sūtra, the components of this world are earth,
water, fire, air and ether. These are the five great elements (mahābhūta). Then
there are false ego, intelligence and the unmanifested stage of the three modes
of nature. Then there are five senses for acquiring knowledge: the eyes, ears,
nose, tongue and touch. Then five working senses: voice, legs, hands, the anus
and the genitals. Then, above the senses, there is the mind, which is within and
which can be called the sense within. Therefore, including the mind, there are
eleven senses altogether. Then there are the five objects of the senses: smell,
taste, warmth, touch and sound. Now the aggregate of these twenty-four elements
is called the field of activity. If one makes an analytical study of these
twenty-four subjects, then he can very well understand the field of activity.
Then there is desire, hatred, pleasure and pain, which are interactions,
representations of the five great elements in the gross body. The living
symptoms, represented by consciousness and conviction, are the manifestation of
the subtle body—mind, ego and intelligence. These subtle elements are included
within the field of activities.</p>
<p>The five great elements are a gross representation of the subtle false ego. They
are a representation in the material conception. Consciousness is represented by
intelligence, of which the unmanifested stage is the three modes of material
nature. The unmanifested three modes of material nature is called pradhāna.</p>
<p>One who desires to know the twenty-four elements in detail along with their
interactions should study the philosophy in more detail. In Bhagavad-gītā, a
summary only is given.</p>
<p>The body is the representation of all these factors, and there are changes of
the body, which are six in number: the body is born, it grows, it stays, it
produces by-products, then begins to decay, and at the last stage it vanishes.
Therefore the field is a nonpermanent material thing. However, the kṣetrajña,
the knower of the field, its proprietor, is different.</p>

tenfold elements, as described before, This is actually the means to get out of
it. Of all the descriptions of the process of knowledge, the most important
point is described in the first line of the tenth verse: The process of
knowledge terminates in unalloyed devotional service to the Lord. So, if one
does not approach, or is not able to approach, the transcendental service of the
Lord, then the other nineteen items are of no particular value. But, if one
takes to devotional service in full Kṛṣṇa consciousness, the other nineteen
items automatically develop within him. The principle of accepting a spiritual
master, as mentioned in the seventh verse, is essential. Even for one who takes
to devotional service, it is most important. Transcendental life begins when one
accepts a bona fide spiritual master. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Śrī
Kṛṣṇa, clearly states here that this process of knowledge is the actual path.
Anything speculated beyond this is nonsense.</p>
<p>As for the knowledge outlined here, the items may be analyzed as follows:
Humility means that one should not be anxious to have the satisfaction of being
honored by others. The material conception of life makes us very eager to
receive honor from others, but from the point of view of a man in perfect
knowledge—who knows that he is not this body—anything, honor or dishonor,
pertaining to this body is useless. One should not be hankering after this
material deception. People are very anxious to be famous for their religion, and
consequently sometimes it is found that without understanding the principles of
religion, one enters into some group, which is not actually following religious
principles, and then wants to advertise himself as a religious mentor. As for
actual advancement in spiritual science, one should have a test to see how far
he is progressing. He can judge by these items.</p>
<p>Nonviolence is generally taken to mean not killing or destroying the body, but
actually nonviolence means not to put others into distress. People in general
are trapped by ignorance in the material concept of life, and they perpetually
suffer material pains. So, unless one elevates people to spiritual knowledge,
one is practicing violence. One should try his best to distribute real knowledge
to the people, so that they may become enlightened and leave this material
entanglement. That is nonviolence.</p>
<p>Tolerance means that one should be practiced to bear insult and dishonor from
others. If one is engaged in the advancement of spiritual knowledge, there will
be so many insults and much dishonor from others. This is expected because
material nature is so constituted. Even a boy like Prahlāda, who, only five
years old, was engaged in the cultivation of spiritual knowledge, was endangered
when his father became antagonistic to his devotion. The father tried to kill
him in so many ways, but Prahlada tolerated him. So, for making advancement in
spiritual knowledge, there may be many impediments, but we should be tolerant
and continue our progress with determination.</p>
<p>Simplicity means that without diplomacy one should be so straightforward that he
can disclose the real truth even to an enemy. As for acceptance of the spiritual
master, that is essential, because without the instruction of a bona fide
spiritual master, one cannot progress in the spiritual science. One should
approach the spiritual master with all humility and offer him all services so
that he will be pleased to bestow his blessings upon the disciple. Because a
bona fide spiritual master is a representative of Kṛṣṇa, if he bestows any
blessings upon his disciple, that will make the disciple immediately advanced
without the disciple’s following the regulated principles. Or, the regulated
principles will be easier for one who has served the spiritual master without
reservation.</p>
<p>Cleanliness is essential for making advancement in spiritual life. There are two
kinds of cleanliness: external and internal. External cleanliness means taking a
bath, but for internal cleanliness, one has to think of Kṛṣṇa always and chant
Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/Hare Rāma. Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma
Hare Hare. This process cleans the accumulated dust of past karma from the mind.</p>
<p>Steadiness means that one should be very determined to make progress in
spiritual life. Without such determination, one cannot make tangible progress.
And self-control means that one should not accept anything which is detrimental
to the path of spiritual progress. One should become accustomed to this and
reject anything which is against the path of spiritual progress. This is real
renunciation. The senses are so strong that they are always anxious to have
sense gratification. One should not cater to these demands, which are not
necessary. The senses should only be gratified to keep the body fit so that one
can discharge his duty in advancing in spiritual life. The most important and
uncontrollable sense is the tongue. If one can control the tongue, then there is
every possibility of controlling the other senses. The function of the tongue is
to taste and to vibrate. Therefore, by systematic regulation, the tongue should
always be engaged in tasting the remnants of foodstuffs offered to Kṛṣṇa and
chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa. As far as the eyes are concerned, they should not be
allowed to see anything but the beautiful form of Kṛṣṇa. That will control the
eyes. Similarly, the ears should be engaged in hearing about Kṛṣṇa and the nose
in smelling the flowers offered to Kṛṣṇa. This is the process of devotional
service, and it is understood here that Bhagavad-gītā is simply expounding the
science of devotional service. Devotional service is the main and sole
objective. Unintelligent commentators on the Gītā try to divert the mind of the
reader to other subjects, but there is no other subject in Bhagavad-gītā but
devotional service.</p>
<p>False ego means accepting this body as oneself. When one understands that he is
not his body and is spirit soul, that is real ego. Ego is there. False ego is
condemned, but not real ego. In the Vedic literature, it is said: ahaṁ
brahmāsmi. I am Brahman, I am spirit. This “I am,” the sense of self, also
exists in the liberated stage of self-realization. This sense of “I am” is ego,
but when the sense of “I am” is applied to this false body, it is false ego.
When the sense of self is applied to reality, that is real ego. There are some
philosophers who say we should give up our ego, but we cannot give up our ego
because ego means identity. We ought, of course, to give up the false
identification with the body.</p>
<p>One should try to understand the distress of accepting birth, death, old age and
disease. There are descriptions in various Vedic literatures of birth. In the
Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam the world of the unborn, the child’s stay in the womb of the
mother, its suffering, etc., are all very graphically described. It should be
thoroughly understood that birth is distressful. Because we forget how much
distress we have suffered within the womb of the mother, we do not make any
solution to the repetition of birth and death. Similarly at the time of death,
there are all kinds of sufferings, and they are also mentioned in the
authoritative scriptures. These should be discussed. And as far as disease and
old age are concerned, everyone gets practical experience. No one wants to be
diseased, and no one wants to become old, but there is no avoiding these. Unless
we have a pessimistic view of this material life, considering the distresses of
birth, death, old age and disease, there is no impetus for our making
advancement in spiritual life.</p>
<p>As for detachment from children, wife and home, it is not meant that one should
have no feeling for these. They are natural objects of affection, but when they
are not favorable to spiritual progress, then one should not be attached to
them. The best process for making the home pleasant is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. If
one is in full Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he can make his home very happy because this
process of Kṛṣṇa consciousness is very easy. One need only chant Hare Kṛṣṇa,
Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare,
accept the remnants of foodstuffs offered to Kṛṣṇa, have some discussion on
books like Bhagavad-gītā and Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, and engage oneself in Deity
worship. These four will make one happy. One should train the members of his
family in this way. The family members can sit down morning and evening and
chant together Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/Hare Rāma, Hare
Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare. If one can mold his family life in this way to
develop Kṛṣṇa consciousness, following these four principles, then there is no
need to change from family life to renounced life. But if it is not congenial,
not favorable for spiritual advancement, then family life should be abandoned.
One must sacrifice everything to realize or serve Kṛṣṇa, just as Arjuna did.
Arjuna did not want to kill his family members, but when he understood that
these family members were impediments to his Kṛṣṇa realization, he accepted the
instruction of Kṛṣṇa and fought and killed them. In all cases, one should be
detached from the happiness and distress of family life because in this world
one can never be fully happy or fully miserable. Happiness and distress are
concommitant factors of material life. One should learn to tolerate, as advised
in Bhagavad-gītā. One can never restrict the coming and going of happiness and
distress, so one should be detached from the materialistic way of life and be
automatically equiposed in both cases. Generally, when we get something
desirable, we are very happy, and when we get something undesirable, we are
distressed. But if we are actually in the spiritual position, these things will
not agitate us. To reach that stage, we have to practice unbreakable devotional
service; devotional service to Kṛṣṇa without deviation means engaging oneself in
the nine processes of devotional service, chanting, hearing, worshiping,
offering respect, etc., as described in the last verse of the Ninth Chapter.
That process should be followed. Naturally, when one is adapted to the spiritual
way of life, he will not want to mix with materialistic men. That would go
against his grain. One may test himself by seeing how far he is inclined to live
in a solitary place without unwanted association.</p>
<p>Naturally a devotee has no taste for unnecessary sporting or cinema-going or
enjoying some social function, because he understands that these are simply a
waste of time. There are many research scholars and philosophers who study sex
life or some other subject, but according to Bhagavad-gītā, such research work
and philosophical speculation have no value. That is more or less nonsensical.
According to Bhagavad-gītā, one should make research by philosophical discretion
into the nature of the soul. One should make research to understand with what
the self is concerned. That is recommended here.</p>
<p>As far as self-realization is concerned, it is clearly stated here that
bhakti-yoga is especially practical. As soon as there is a question of devotion,
one must consider the relationship between the Supersoul and the individual
soul. The individual soul and the Supersoul cannot be one, at least not in the
bhakti conception, the devotional conception of life. This service of the
individual soul to the Supreme Soul is eternal, nityam, as is clearly stated. So
bhakti or devotional service is eternal. One should be established in that
philosophical conviction, otherwise it is only a waste of time, ignorance.</p>
<p>In the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, this is explained; vadanti tat tattva-vidas tattvaṁ
yaj jñānam advayam. “Those who are actually knowers of the Absolute Truth know
that the Self is realized in three different phases as Brahman, Paramātmā and
Bhagavān.” (Bhāg. 1.2.11) Bhagavān is the last word in the realization of the
Absolute Truth; therefore one should reach up to that platform of understanding
the Supreme Personality of Godhead and thus engage in the devotional service of
the Lord. That is perfection of knowledge.</p>
<p>Beginning from practicing humility up to the point of realization of the Supreme
Truth, the Absolute Personality of Godhead, this process is just like a
staircase beginning from the ground floor up to the top floor. Now on this
staircase there are so many people who have reached the first floor, the second
or third floor, etc., but unless one reaches the top floor, which is the
understanding of Kṛṣṇa, he is at a lower stage of knowledge. If anyone wants to
compete with God and at the same time make advancement in spiritual knowledge,
he will be frustrated. It is clearly stated that without humility understanding
is harmful. To think oneself God is most puffed up. Although the living entity
is always being kicked by the stringent laws of material nature, still he
thinks, “I am God” because of ignorance. One should be humble and know that he
is subordinate to the Supreme Lord. Due to rebellion against the Supreme Lord,
one becomes subordinate to material nature. One must know and be convinced of
this truth.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Lord has explained the field of activities and the knower of the field. He
has also explained the process of knowing the knower of the field of activities.
Now He is explaining the knowable, both the soul and the Supersoul respectively.
By knowledge of the knower, both the soul and the Supersoul, one can relish the
nectar of life. As explained in the Second Chapter, the living entity is
eternal. This is also confirmed here. There is no specific date at which the
jīva was born. Nor can anyone trace out the history of jīvātmā’s manifestation
from the Supreme Lord. Therefore it is beginningless. The Vedic literature
confirms this: na jāyate mṛjayate vā vipaścit. The knower of the body is never
born and never dies, and he is full of knowledge. The Supreme Lord is also
stated in the Vedic literature as pradhāna-kṣetrajña-patir guṇeśaḥ. The Supreme
Lord as the Supersoul is the chief knower of the body, and He is the master of
the three modes of material nature. In the smṛti it is said: dāsa-bhūto harer
eva nānyasvaiva kadācana. The living entities are eternally in the service of
the Supreme Lord. This is also confirmed by Lord Caitanya in His teaching;
therefore the description of Brahman mentioned in this verse is in relation to
the individual soul, and when the word Brahman is applied to the living entity,
it is to be understood that he is vijñānaṁ brahma as opposed to ananta-brahma.
Ananta-brahma is the Supreme Brahman Personality of Godhead.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Everywhere are His hands and legs, His eyes and faces, and He hears everything.
In this way the Supersoul exists.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>As the sun exists diffusing its unlimited rays, so does the Supersoul, or
Supreme Personality of Godhead. He exists in His all-pervading form, and in Him
exist all the individual living entities, beginning from the first great
teacher, Brahmā, down to the small ants. There are unlimited heads, legs, hands
and eyes, and unlimited living entities. All are existing in and on the
Supersoul. Therefore the Supersoul is all-pervading. The individual soul,
however, cannot say that he has his hands, legs and eyes everywhere. That is not
possible. If he thinks that although under ignorance he is not conscious that
his hands and legs are diffused all over, but when he attains to proper
knowledge he will come to that stage, his thinking is contradictory. This means
that the individual soul, having become conditioned by material nature, is not
supreme. The Supreme is different from the individual soul. The Supreme Lord can
extend His hand without limit; the individual soul cannot. In Bhagavad-gītā the
Lord says that if anyone offers Him a flower, or a fruit, or a little water, He
accepts. If the Lord is a far distance away, how can He accept things? This is
the omnipotence of the Lord: even though He is situated in His own abode, far,
far away from earth, He can extend His hand to accept what anyone offers. That
is His potency. In the Brahmā-saṁhitā it is stated, goloka eva nivasati:
although He is always engaged in pastimes in His transcendental planet, He is
all-pervading. The individual soul cannot claim that he is all-pervading.
Therefore this verse describes the Supreme Soul, the Personality of Godhead, not
the individual soul.</p>

<p>The Supersoul is the original source of all senses, yet He is without senses. He
is unattached, although He is the maintainer of all living beings. He transcends
the modes of nature, and at the same time He is the master of all modes of
material nature.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Lord, although the source of all the senses of the living entities,
doesn’t have material senses like they have. Actually, the individual souls have
spiritual senses, but in condemned life they are covered with the material
elements and therefore the sense activities are exhibited through matter. The
Supreme Lord’s senses are not so covered. His senses are transcendental and are
therefore called nirguṇa. Guṇa means the material modes, but His senses are
without material covering. It should be understood that His senses are not
exactly like ours. Although He is the source of all our sensual activities, He
has His transcendental senses which are uncontaminated. This is very nicely
explained in the Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad in the verse: sarvataḥ pāṇi-pādam. The
Supreme Personality of Godhead has no hands which are materially contaminated,
but He has His hands and accepts whatever sacrifice is offered to Him. That is
the distinction between the conditioned soul and the Supersoul. He has no
material eyes, but He has eyes—otherwise how could He see? He sees everything,
past, present and future. He lives within the heart of the living being, and He
knows what we have done in the past, what we are doing now, and what is awaiting
us in the future. This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-gītā: He knows everything,
but no one knows Him. It is said that the Supreme Lord has no legs like us, but
He can travel throughout space because He has spiritual legs. In other words,
the Lord is not impersonal; He has His eyes, legs, hands and everything else,
and because we are part and parcel of the Supreme Lord we also have these
things. But His hands, legs, eyes and senses are not contaminated by material
nature.</p>
<p>Bhagavad-gītā also confirms that when the Lord appears He appears as He is by
His internal potency. He is not contaminated by the material energy because He
is the Lord of material energy. In the Vedic literature we find that His whole
embodiment is spiritual. He has His eternal form called sac-cid-ānanda-vigraha.
He is full of all opulence. He is the proprietor of all wealth and the owner of
all energy. He is the most intelligent and is full of knowledge. These are some
of the symptoms of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is maintainer of all
living entities and the witness of all activities. As far as we can understand
from Vedic literature, the Supreme Lord is always transcendental. Although we do
not see His head, face, hands, or legs, He has them, and when we are elevated to
the transcendental situation then we can see the Lord’s form. Due to materially
contaminated senses, we cannot see His form. Therefore the impersonalists who
are still materially affected cannot understand the Personality of Godhead.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In Vedic literature we understand that Nārāyaṇa, the Supreme Person, is residing
both outside and inside of every living entity. He is present both in the
spiritual and material world. Although He is far, far away, still He is near to
us. These are the statements of Vedic literature. Āsīno dūraṁ vrajati śayāno
yāti sarvataḥ. And, because He is always engaged in transcendental bliss, we
cannot understand how He is enjoying His full opulence. We cannot see or
understand with these material senses. Therefore in the Vedic language it is
said that to understand Him our material mind and senses cannot act. But one who
has purified his mind and senses by practicing Kṛṣṇa consciousness in devotional
service can see Him constantly. It is confirmed in Brahmā-saṁhitā that the
devotee who has developed love for the Supreme God can see Him always, without
cessation. And it is confirmed in Bhagavad-gītā (11.54) that He can be seen and
understood only by devotional service. Bhaktyā tvananyayā śakyaḥ.</p>

situated as one. Although He is the maintainer of every living entity, it is to
be understood that He devours and develops all.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Lord is situated in everyone’s heart as the Supersoul. Does that mean that
He has become divided? No. Actually, He is one. The example is given of the sun:
the sun, at the meridian, is situated in his place. But if one goes for five
thousand miles in all directions and asks, “Where is the sun?” everyone will say
that it is shining on his head. In the Vedic literature this example is given to
show that although He is undivided, He is situated as if divided. Also it is
said in Vedic literature that one Viṣṇu is present everywhere by His
omnipotence, just as the sun appears in many places to many persons. And the
Supreme Lord, although the maintainer of every living entity, devours everything
at the time of annihilation. This was confirmed in the Eleventh Chapter when the
Lord said that He has come to devour all the warriors assembled at Kurukṣetra.
He also mentions that in the form of time He devours also. He is the
annihilator, the killer of all. When there is creation, He develops all from
their original state, and at the time of annihilation He devours them. The Vedic
hymns confirm the fact that He is the origin of all living entities and the rest
of al1. After creation, everything rests in His omnipotence, and after
annihilation, everything again returns to rest in Him. These are the
confirmations of Vedic hymns. Yato vā imāni bhūtāni jāyante yena jātāni jīvanti

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Supersoul, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the source of light in all
luminous objects like the sun, moon, stars, etc. In the Vedic literature we find
that in the spiritual kingdom there is no need of sun or moon because the
effulgence of the Supreme Lord is there. In the material world that brahmajyoti
the Lord’s spiritual effulgence, is covered by the mahat-tattva, the material
elements; therefore in this material world we require the assistance of sun,
moon, electricity, etc., for light. But in the spiritual world there is no need
of such things. It is clearly stated in the Vedic literature that because of His
luminous effulgence, everything is illuminated. It is clear, therefore, that His
situation is not in the material world. He is situated in the spiritual world
which is far, far away in the spiritual sky. That is also confirmed in the Vedic
literature. Āditya-varṇam tamasaḥ parastāt. He is just like the sun, eternally
luminous, but He is far, far beyond the darkness of this material world. His
knowledge is transcendental. The Vedic literature confirms that Brahman is
concentrated transcendental knowledge. To one who is anxious to be transferred
to that spiritual world, knowledge is given by the Supreme Lord who is situated
in everyone’s heart.</p>
<p>One Vedic mantra says: taṁ ha devam ātma-buddhi-prakāśaṁ mumukṣur vai śaraṇam
aham prapadye. One must surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead if he
at all wants liberation. As far as the goal of ultimate knowledge is concerned,
it is also confirmed in Vedic literature: tam eva viditvātimṛtyum eti. “Only by
knowing You can one surpass the boundary of birth and death.” He is situated in
everyone’s heart as the supreme controller. The Supreme has legs and hands
distributed everywhere, and this cannot be said of the individual soul.
Therefore that there are two knowers of the field of activity, the individual
soul and the Supersoul, must be admitted. One’s hands and legs are distributed
locally, but Kṛṣṇa’s hands and legs are distributed everywhere. This is
confirmed in the Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad: sarvasya prabhum īśānaṁ sarvasya śaraṇaṁ
bṛhat. That Supreme Personality of Godhead, Supersoul, is the prabhu or master
of all living entities; therefore He is the ultimate center of all living
entities. So there is no denying the fact that the Supreme Supersoul and the
individual soul are always different.</p>

<p>The Lord has described in summary the body, knowledge and the knowable. This
knowledge is of three things: the knower, the knowable and the process of
knowing. Combined, these are called vijñānam, or the science of knowledge.
Perfect knowledge can be understood by the unalloyed devotees of the Lord
directly. Others are unable to understand. The monists say that at the ultimate
stage these three items become one, but the devotees do not accept this.
Knowledge and development of knowledge mean understanding oneself in Kṛṣṇa
consciousness. We are being led by material consciousness, but as soon as we
transfer all consciousness to Kṛṣṇa’s activities and realize that Kṛṣṇa is
everything, then we attain real knowledge. In other words, knowledge is nothing
but the preliminary stage of understanding devotional service perfectly.</p>

<p>Material nature and the living entities should be understood to be
beginningless. Their transformations and the modes of matter are products of
material nature.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>By this knowledge, the body, the field of activities and the knowers of the body
(both the individual soul and the Supersoul) can be known. The body is the field
of activity and is composed of material nature. It is the individual soul which
is embodied. Enjoying the activities of the body is the puruṣa, or the living
entity. He is one knower, and the other is the Supersoul. Of course, it is to be
understood that both the Supersoul and the individual entity are different
manifestations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The living entity is in
the category of His energy, and the Supersoul is in the category of His personal
expansion.</p>
<p>Both material nature and the living entity are eternal. That is to say that they
existed before the creation. The material manifestation is from the energy of
the Supreme Lord and so also are the living entities, but they are of the
superior energy. Both of them existed before this cosmos was manifested.
Material nature was absorbed in the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Mahā-Visṇu,
and when it was required, it was manifested by the agency of mahat-tattva.
Similarly, the living entities are also in Him, and because they are
conditioned, they are adverse to serving the Supreme Lord. Thus they are not
allowed to enter into the spiritual sky. After the winding up of material
nature, these living entities are again given a chance to act in the material
world and prepare themselves to enter into the spiritual world. That is the
mystery of this material creation. Actually the living entity is originally the
spiritual part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, but due to his rebellious nature,
he is conditioned within material nature. It really does not matter how these
living entities or superior entities of the Supreme Lord have come in contact
with material nature. The Supreme Personality of Godhead knows, however, how and
why this actually took place. In the scriptures the Lord says that those
attracted by this material nature are undergoing a hard struggle for existence.
But we should know it with certainty from the descriptions of these few verses
that all the transformations and influences of material nature by the three
modes are also productions of material nature. All transformations and variety
in respect to living entities are due to the body. As far as spirit is
concerned, living entities are all the same.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Nature is said to be the cause of all material activities and effects, whereas
the living entity is the cause of the various sufferings and enjoyments in this
world.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The different manifestations of body and senses among the living entities are
due to material nature. There are 8,400,000 different species of life, and these
varieties are the creation of the material nature. They arise from the different
sensual pleasures of the 1iving entity, who thus desires to live in this body or
that. When he is put into different bodies, he enjoys different kinds of
happiness and distress. His material happiness and distress are due to his body,
and not to himself as he is. In his original state there is no doubt of
enjoyment; therefore that is his real state. Because of the desire to lord it
over material nature, he is in the material world. In the spiritual world there
is no such thing. The spiritual world is pure, but in the material world
everyone is struggling hard to acquire victims who present different pleasures
to the body. It might be more clear to state that this body is the effect of the
senses. The senses are instruments for gratifying desire. Now, the sum
total—body and instrument senses—are offered by material nature, and, as will be
clear in the next verse, the living entity is blessed or damned with
circumstances according to his past desire and activity. According to one’s
desires and activities, material nature places one in various residential
quarters. The being himself is the cause of his attaining such residential
quarters and his attendant enjoyment or suffering. Once placed in some
particular kind of body, he comes under the control of nature because the body,
being matter, acts according to the laws of nature. At that time, the 1iving
entity has no power to change that law. Suppose an entity is put into the body
of a dog. As soon as he is put into the body of a dog, he must act like a dog.
He cannot act otherwise. And if the living entity is put into the body of a hog,
then he is forced to eat stool and act like a hog. Similarly, if the living
entity is put into the body of a demigod, he must act according to his body.
This is the law of nature. But in all circumstances, the Supersoul is with the
individual soul. That is explained in the Vedas as follows: dvā suparṇā sayujā
sakhāyā. The Supreme Lord is so kind upon the living entity that He always
accompanies the individual soul and in all circumstances is present as the
Supersoul or Paramātmā.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The living entity in material nature thus follows the ways of life, enjoying the
three modes of nature. This is due to his association with that material nature.
Thus he meets with good and evil amongst various species.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>This verse is very important for an understanding of how the living entities
transmigrate from one body to another. It is explained in the Second Chapter
that the living entity is transmigrating from one body to another just as one
changes dress. This change of dress is due to his attachment to material
existence. As long as he is captivated by this false manifestation, he has to
continue transmigrating from one body to another. Due to his desire to lord it
over material nature, he is put into such undesirable circumstances. Under the
influence of material desire, the entity is born sometimes as a demigod,
sometimes as a man, sometimes as a beast, as a bird, as a worm, as an aquatic,
as a saintly man, as a bug. This is going on. And in all cases the living entity
thinks himself to be the master of his circumstances, yet he is under the
influence of material nature.</p>
<p>How he is put into such different bodies is explained here. It is due to
association with the different modes of nature. One has to rise, therefore,
above the three material modes and become situated in the transcendental
position. That is called Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Unless one is situated in Kṛṣṇa
consciousness, his material consciousness will oblige him to transfer from one
body to another because he has material desires since time immemorial. But he
has to change that conception. That change can be effected only by hearing from
authoritative sources. The best example is here: Arjuna is hearing the science
of God from Kṛṣṇa. The living entity, if he submits to this hearing process,
will lose his long-cherished desire to dominate material nature, and gradually
and proportionately, as he reduces his long desire to dominate, he comes to
enjoy spiritual happiness. In a Vedic mantra it is said that as he becomes
learned in association with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he
proportionately relishes his eternal blissful life.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Yet in this body there is another, a transcendental enjoyer who is the Lord, the
supreme proprietor, who exists as the overseer and permitter, and who is known
as the Supersoul.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>It is stated here that the Supersoul, who is always with the individual soul, is
the representation of the Supreme Lord. He is not an ordinary living entity.
Because the monist philosophers take the knower of the body to be one, they
think that there is no difference between the Supersoul and the individual soul.
To clarify this, the Lord says that He is the representation of Paramātmā in
every body. He is different from the individual soul; He is paraḥ,
transcendental. The individual soul enjoys the activities of a particular field,
but the Supersoul is present not as finite enjoyer nor as one taking part in
bodily activities, but as the witness, overseer, permitter and supreme enjoyer.
His name is Paramātmā, not ātmā, and He is transcendental. It is distinctly
clear that the ātmā and Paramātmā are different. The Supersoul, the Paramātmā,
has legs and hands everywhere, but the individual soul does not. And because He
is the Supreme Lord, He is present within to sanction the individual soul’s
desiring material enjoyment. Without the sanction of the Supreme Soul, the
individual soul cannot do anything. The individual is bhakta or the sustained,
and He is bhukta or the maintainer. There are innumerable living entities, and
He is staying in them as a friend.</p>
<p>The fact is that individual living entities are eternally part and parcel of the
Supreme Lord, and both of them are very intimately related as friends. But the
living entity has the tendency to reject the sanction of the Supreme Lord and
act independantly in an attempt to dominate the supreme nature, and because he
has this tendency, he is called the marginal energy of the Supreme Lord. The
living entity can be situated either in the material energy or the spiritual
energy. As long as he is conditioned by the material energy, the Supreme Lord,
as his friend, the Supersoul, stays with him just to get him to return to the
spiritual energy. The Lord is always eager to take him back to the spiritual
energy, but due to his minute independence, the individual entity is continually
rejecting the association of spiritual light. This misuse of independence is the
cause of his material strife in the conditioned nature. The Lord, therefore, is
always giving instruction from within and from without. From without He gives
instructions as stated in Bhagavad-gītā, and from within He tries to convince
him that his activities in the material field are not conducive to real
happiness. “Just give it up and turn your faith toward Me. Then you will be
happy,” He says. Thus the intelligent person who places his faith in the
Paramātmā or the Supreme Personality of Godhead begins to advance toward a
blissful eternal life of knowledge</p>

<p>Clear understanding of material nature, the Supersoul, the individual soul and
their interrelation makes one eligible to become liberated and turn to the
spiritual atmosphere without being forced to return to this material nature.
This is the result of knowledge. The purpose of knowledge is to understand
distinctly that the living entity has by chance fallen into this material
existence. By his personal endeavor in association with authorities, saintly
persons and a spiritual master, he has to understand his position and then
revert to spiritual consciousness or Kṛṣṇa consciousness by understanding
Bhagavad-gītā as it is explained by the Personality of Godhead. Then it is
certain that he will never come again into this material existence; he will be
transferred into the spiritual world for a blissful eternal life of knowledge.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>That Supersoul is perceived by some through meditation, by some through the
cultivation of knowledge, and by others through working without fruitive desire.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Lord informs Arjuna that the conditioned soul can be divided into two
classes as far as man’s search for self-realization is concerned. Those who are
atheists, agnostics and skeptics are beyond the sense of spiritual
understanding. But there are others who are faithful in their understanding of
spiritual life, and they are called workers who have renounced fruitive results.
Those who always try to establish the doctrine of monism are also counted among
the atheists and agnostics. In other words, only the devotees of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead are really capable of spiritual understanding because
they understand that beyond this material nature there is the spiritual world
and the Supreme Personality of Godhead who is expanded as the Paramātmā, the
Supersoul in everyone, the all-pervading Godhead. Of course there are those who
try to understand the Supreme Absolute Truth by cultivation of knowledge, and
they can be counted in the second class. The atheistic philosophers analyze this
material world into twenty-four elements, and they place the individual soul as
the twenty-fifth item. When they are able to understand the nature of the
individual soul to be transcendental to the material elements, they are able to
understand also that above the individual soul there is the Supreme Personality
of Godhead. He is the twenty-sixth element. Thus gradually they also come to the
standard of devotional service in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Those who work without
fruitive results are also perfect in their attitude. They are given a chance to
advance to the platform of devotional service in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Here it is
stated that there are some people who are pure in consciousness and who try to
find out the Supersoul by meditation, and when they discover the Supersoul
within themselves, they become transcendentally situated. Similarly, there are
others who also try to understand the Supreme Soul by cultivation of knowledge,
and there are others who cultivate the haṭha-yoga system and who try to satisfy
the Supreme Personality of Godhead by childish activities.</p>

to worship the Supreme Person upon hearing about Him from others. Because of

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>This verse is particularly applicable to modern society because in modern
society there is practically no education in spiritual matters. Some of the
people may appear to be atheistic or agnostic or philosophical, but actually
there is no knowledge of philosophy. As for the common man, if he is a good
soul, then there is a chance for advancement by hearing. This hearing process is
very important. Lord Caitanya, who preached Kṛṣṇa consciousness in the modern
world, gave great stress to hearing because if the common man simply hears from
authoritative sources, he can progress, especially, according to Lord Caitanya,
if he hears the transcendental vibration Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa,
Hare Hare/Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare. It is stated, therefore,
that all men should take advantage of hearing from realized souls and gradually
become able to understand everything. The worship of the Supreme Lord will then
undoubtedly take place. Lord Caitanya has said that in this age no one needs to
change his position, but one should give up the endeavor to understand the
Absolute Truth by speculative reasoning. One should learn to become the servant
of those who are in knowledge of the Supreme Lord. If one is fortunate enough to
take shelter of a pure devotee, hear from him about self-realization and follow
in his footsteps, he will be gradually elevated to the position of a pure
devotee. In this verse particularly the process of hearing is strongly
recommended, and this is very appropriate. Although the common man is often not
as capable as so-called philosophers, faithful hearing from an authoritative
person will help one transcend this material existence and go back to Godhead,
back to home.</p>

a combination of the living entity and material nature. There are many
manifestations like trees, mountains and hills, which are not moving, and there
are many existences which are moving, and all of them are but combinations of
material nature and superior nature, the living entity. Without the touch of the
superior nature, the living entity, nothing can grow. Therefore the relationship
between matter and nature is eternally going on, and this combination is
effected by the Supreme Lord; therefore He is the controller of both the
superior and inferior natures. The material nature is created by Him, and the
superior nature is placed in this material nature, and thus all these activities
and manifestations take place.</p>

destroyed they think that everything is finished, but actually it is not so.
After the destruction of the body, both the soul and the Supersoul exist, and
they go on eternally in many various moving and unmoving forms. The Sanskrit
word parameśvaram is sometimes translated as the individual soul because the
soul is the master of the body, and after the destruction of the body he
transfers to another form. In that way he is master. But there are others who
interpret this parameśvaram to be the Supersoul. In either case, both the
Supersoul and the individual soul continue. They are not destroyed. One who can

To fulfill desires, one is given the body, with which he acts accordingly.
Practically speaking, the body is a machine, designed by the Supreme Lord, to
fulfill desires. Because of desires, one is put into difficult circumstances to
suffer or to enjoy. This transcendental vision of the living entity, when

spirit soul, due to contact with material nature, gets different types of

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O son of Bharata, as the sun alone illuminates all this universe, so does the
living entity, one within the body, illuminate the entire body by consciousness.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>There are various theories regarding consciousness. Here in Bhagavad-gītā the
example of the sun and the sunshine is given. As the sun is situated in one
place, but is illuminating the whole universe, so a small particle of spirit
soul, although situated in the heart of this body, is illuminating the whole
body by consciousness. Thus consciousness is the proof of the presence of the
soul, as sunshine or light is the proof of the presence of the sun.</p>
<p>When the soul is present in the body, there is consciousness all over the body,
and as soon as the soul has passed from the body, there is no more
consciousness. This can be easily understood by any intelligent man. Therefore
consciousness is not a production of the combinations of matter. It is the
symptom of the living entity. The consciousness of the living entity, although
qualitatively one with the supreme consciousness, is not supreme because the
consciousness of one particular body does not share that of another body. But
the Supersoul, which is situated in all bodies as the friend of the individual
soul, is conscious of all bodies. That is the difference between supreme
consciousness and individual consciousness.</p>

<p>One who knowingly sees this difference between the body and the owner of the
body and can understand the process of liberation from this bondage, also
attains to the supreme goal.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The purport of this Thirteenth Chapter is that one should know the distinction
between the body, the owner of the body, and the Supersoul. A faithful person
should at first have some good association to hear of God and thus gradually
become enlightened. If one accepts a spiritual master, he can learn to
distinguish between matter and spirit, and that becomes the steppingstone for
further spiritual realization. A spiritual master teaches his students to get
free from the material concept of life by various instructions. For instance, in
Bhagavad-gītā we find Kṛṣṇa instructing Arjuna to free him from materialistic
considerations.</p>
<p>One can understand that this body is matter; it can be analyzed with its
twenty-four elements. That is the gross manifestation. And the subtle
manifestation is the mind and psychological effects. And the symptoms of life
are the interaction of these features. But over and above this, there is the
soul, and there is also the Supersoul. The soul and the Supersoul are two. This
material world is working by the conjunction of the soul and the twenty-four
material elements. One who can see the constitution of the whole material
manifestation as this combination of the soul and material elements and also can
see the situation of the Supreme Soul becomes eligible for transfer to the
spiritual world. These things are meant for contemplation and for realization,
and one should have a complete understanding of this chapter with the help of
the spiritual master.</p>
