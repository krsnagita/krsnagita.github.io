<p>guhyam adhyātma-saṁjñitam</p>

<p>arjunaḥ uvāca—Arjuna said; mat-anugrahāya—just to show me favor;
paramam—supreme; guhyam—confidential; adhyātma—spiritual; saṁjñitam—in the
matter of; yat—what; tvayā—by You; uktam—said; vacaḥ—words; tena—by that;
mohaḥ—illusion; ayam—this; vigataḥ—is educated; mama—my.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Arjuna said: I have heard Your instruction on confidential spiritual matters
which You have so kindly delivered unto me, and my illusion is now dispelled.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>This chapter reveals Kṛṣṇa as the cause of all causes. He is even the cause of
the Mahā-Viṣṇu, and from Him the material universes emanate. Kṛṣṇa is not an
incarnation; He is the source of all incarnations. That has been completely
explained in the last chapter.</p>
<p>Now, as far as Arjuna is concerned, he says that his illusion is over. This
means that Arjuna no longer thinks of Kṛṣṇa as a mere human being, as a friend
of his, but as the source of everything. Arjuna is very enlightened and is glad
that he has a great friend like Kṛṣṇa, but now he is thinking that although he
may accept Kṛṣṇa as the source of everything, others may not. So in order to
establish Kṛṣṇa’s divinity for all, he is requesting Kṛṣṇa in this chapter to
show His universal form. Actually when one sees the universal form of Kṛṣṇa one
becomes frightened, like Arjuna, but Kṛṣṇa is so kind that after showing it He
converts Himself again into His original form. Arjuna agrees to what Kṛṣṇa says
several times. Kṛṣṇa is speaking to him just for his benefit, and Arjuna
acknowledges that all this is happening to him by Kṛṣṇa’s grace. He is now
convinced that Kṛṣṇa is the cause of all causes and is present in everyone’s
heart as the Supersoul.</p>

<p>śrutau vistaraśo mayā</p>

<p>māhātmyam api cāvyayam</p>
<p>bhava—appearance; apyayau—disappearance; hi—certainly; bhūtānām—of all living
entities; śrutau—have heard; vistaraśaḥ—detail; mayā—by me; tvattaḥ—from You;
kamala-patrākṣa—O lotus-eyed one; māhātmyam—glories; api—also; ca—and;
avyayam—inexhaustible.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O lotus-eyed one, I have heard from You in detail about the appearance and
disappearance of every living entity, as realized through Your inexhaustible
glories.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Arjuna addresses Lord Kṛṣṇa as “lotus-eyed” (Kṛṣṇa’s eyes appear just like the
petals of a lotus flower) out of his joy, for Kṛṣṇa has assured him, in the last
verse of the previous chapter, that He sustains the entire universe with just a
fragment of Himself. He is the source of everything in this material
manifestation, and Arjuna has heard of this from the Lord in detail. Arjuna
further knows that in spite of His being the source of all appearances and
disappearances, He is aloof from them. His personality is not lost, although He
is all-pervading. That is the inconceivable opulence of Kṛṣṇa which Arjuna
admits that he has thoroughly understood.</p>
<h3 id="113">11.3</h3>
<p>evam etad yathāttha tvam</p>
<p>ātmānaṁ parameśvara</p>
<p>draṣṭum icchāmi te rūpam</p>
<p>aiśvaraṁ puruṣottama</p>
<p>evam—that; etat—this; yathāttha—as it is; tvam—You; ātmānam—the soul;
parameśvara—the Supreme Lord; draṣṭum—to see; icchāmi—I wish; te—You;
rūpam—form; aiśvaram—divine; puruṣottama—O best of personalities.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O greatest of all personalities, O supreme form, though I see here before me
Your actual position, I yet wish to see how You have entered into this cosmic
manifestation. I want to see that form of Yours.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Lord said that because He entered into the material universe by His personal
representation, the cosmic manifestation has been made possible and is going on.
Now as far as Arjuna is concerned, he is inspired by the statements of Kṛṣṇa,
but in order to convince others in the future who may think that Kṛṣṇa is an
ordinary person, he desires to see Him actually in His universal form, to see
how He is acting from within the universe, although He is apart from it.
Arjuna’s asking the Lord’s permission is also significant. Since the Lord is the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, He is present within Arjuna himself; therefore
He knows the desire of Arjuna, and He can understand that Arjuna has no special
desire to see Him in His universal form, for he is completely satisfied to see
Him in His personal form of Kṛṣṇa. But He can understand also that Arjuna wants
to see the universal form to convince others. He did not have any personal
desire for confirmation. Kṛṣṇa also understands that Arjuna wants to see the
universal form to set a criterion, for in the future there would be so many
imposters who would pose themselves as incarnations of God. The people,
therefore, should be careful; one who claims to be Kṛṣṇa should be prepared to
show his universal form to confirm his claim to the people.</p>

<p>manyase—if You think; yadi—if; tat—that; śakyam—able to see; mayā—by me;

tataḥ—then; me—unto me; tvam—You; darśaya—show; ātmānam—Yourself;

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>If You think that I am able to behold Your cosmic form, O my Lord, O master of
all mystic power, then kindly show me that universal self.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>It is said that one can neither see, hear, understand nor perceive the Supreme
Lord, Kṛṣṇa, by the material senses. But if one is engaged in loving
transcendental service to the Lord from the beginning, then one can see the Lord
by revelation. Every living entity is only a spiritual spark; therefore it is
not possible to see or to understand the Supreme Lord. Arjuna, as a devotee,
does not depend on his speculative strength; rather, he admits his limitations
as a living entity and acknowledges Kṛṣṇa’s inestimable position. Arjuna could
understand that for a living entity it is not possible to understand the
unlimited infinite. If the infinite reveals Himself, then it is possible to
understand the nature of the infinite by the grace of the infinite. The word
yogeśvara is also very significant here because the Lord has inconceivable
power. If He likes, He can reveal Himself by His grace, although He is
unlimited. Therefore Arjuna pleads for the inconceivable grace of Kṛṣṇa. He does
not give Kṛṣṇa orders. Kṛṣṇa is not obliged to reveal Himself to anyone unless
one surrenders fully in Kṛṣṇa consciousness and engages in devotional service.
Thus it is not possible for persons who depend on the strength of their mental
speculations to see Kṛṣṇa.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The Blessed Lord said: My dear Arjuna, O son of Pṛthā, behold now My opulences,
hundreds of thousands of varied divine forms, multicolored like the sea.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Arjuna wanted to see Kṛṣṇa in His universal form, which, although a
transcendental form, is just manifested for the cosmic manifestation and is
therefore subject to the temporary time of this material nature. As the material
nature is manifested and not manifested, similarly this universal form of Kṛṣṇa
is manifested and unmanifested. It is not eternally situated in the spiritual
sky like Kṛṣṇa’s other forms. As far as a devotee is concerned, he is not eager
to see the universal form, but because Arjuna wanted to see Kṛṣṇa in this way,
Kṛṣṇa reveals this form. This universal form is not possible to be seen by any
ordinary man. Kṛṣṇa must give one the power to see it.</p>

<p>Even though Arjuna was a personal friend of Kṛṣṇa and the most advanced of
learned men, it was still not possible for him to know everything about Kṛṣṇa.
Here it is stated that humans have neither heard nor known of all these forms
and manifestations. Now Kṛṣṇa reveals these wonderful forms.</p>

the future. Everything is here completely.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>No one can see the entire universe sitting in one place. Even the most advanced
scientist cannot see what is going on in other parts of the universe. Kṛṣṇa
gives him the power to see anything he wants to see, past, present and future.
Thus by the mercy of Kṛṣṇa, Arjuna is able to see everything.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>But you cannot see Me with your present eyes. Therefore I give to you divine
eyes by which you can behold My mystic opulence.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>A pure devotee does not like to see Kṛṣṇa in any form except His form with two
hands; a devotee must see His universal form by His grace, not with the mind but
with spiritual eyes. To see the universal form of Kṛṣṇa, Arjuna is told not to
change his mind but his vision. The universal form of Kṛṣṇa is not very
important; that will be clear in the verses. Yet because Arjuna wanted to see
it, the Lord gives him the particular vision required to see that universal
form.</p>
<p>Devotees who are correctly situated in a transcendental relationship with Kṛṣṇa
are attracted by loving features, not by a godless display of opulences. The
playmates of Kṛṣṇa, the friends of Kṛṣṇa and the parents of Kṛṣṇa never want
Kṛṣṇa to show His opulences. They are so immersed in pure love that they do not
even know that Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In their loving
exchange they forget that Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Lord. In the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam it
is stated that the boys who play with Kṛṣṇa are all highly pious souls, and
after many, many births they are able to play with Kṛṣṇa. Such boys do not know
that Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. They take Him as a personal
friend. The Supreme Person is considered as the impersonal Brahman by great
sages, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead by the devotees, and as a product
of this material nature by ordinary men. The fact is that the devotee is not
concerned to see the viśva-rūpa, the universal form, but Arjuna wanted to see it
to substantiate Kṛṣṇa’s statement so that in the future people could understand
that Kṛṣṇa not only theoretically or philosophically presented Himself as the
Supreme but actually presented Himself as such to Arjuna. Arjuna must confirm
this because Arjuna is the beginning of the paramparā system. Those who are
actually interested to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, and
who follow in the footsteps of Arjuna should understand that Kṛṣṇa not only
theoretically presented Himself as the Supreme, but actually revealed Himself as
the Supreme.</p>
<p>The Lord gave Arjuna the necessary power to see His universal form because He
knew that Arjuna did not particularly want to see it, as we have already
explained.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Arjuna saw in that universal form unlimited mouths and unlimited eyes. It was
all wondrous. The form was decorated with divine, dazzling ornaments and arrayed
in many garbs. He was garlanded gloriously, and there were many scents smeared
over His body. All was magnificent, all-expanding, unlimited. This was seen by
Arjuna.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>These two verses indicate that there is no limit to the hands, mouths, legs,
etc., of the Lord. These manifestations are distributed throughout the universe
and are unlimited. By the grace of the Lord, Arjuna could see them while sitting
in one place. That is due to the inconceivable potency of Kṛṣṇa.</p>

<p>If hundreds of thousands of suns rose up at once into the sky, they might

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>What Arjuna saw was indescribable, yet Sañjaya is trying to give a mental
picture of that great revelation to Dhṛtarāṣṭra. Neither Sañjaya nor Dhṛtarāṣṭra
were present, but Sañjaya, by the grace of Vyāsa, could see whatever happened.
Thus he now compares the situation, as far as it can be understood, to an
imaginable phenomenon (i.e. thousands of suns).</p>

many thousands.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The word tatra (there) is very significant. It indicates that both Arjuna and
Kṛṣṇa were sitting on the chariot when Arjuna saw the universal form. Others on
the battlefield could not see this form because Kṛṣṇa gave the vision only to
Arjuna. Arjuna could see in the body of Kṛṣṇa many thousands of universes. As we
learn from Vedic scriptures, there are many universes and many planets. Some of
them are made of earth, some are made of gold, some are made of jewels, some are
very great, some are not so great, etc. Sitting on his chariot, Arjuna could see
all these universes. But no one could understand what was going on between
Arjuna and Kṛṣṇa.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Then, bewildered and astonished, his hair standing on end, Arjuna began to pray
with folded hands, offering obeisances to the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Once the divine vision is revealed, the relationship between Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna
changes immediately. Before, Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna had a relationship based on
friendship, but here, after the revelation, Arjuna is offering obeisances with
great respect, and with folded hands he is praying to Kṛṣṇa. He is praising the
universal form. Thus Arjuna’s relationship becomes one of wonder rather than
friendship. Great devotees see Kṛṣṇa as the reservoir of all relationships. In
the scriptures there are twelve basic kinds of relationships mentioned, and all
of them are present in Kṛṣṇa. It is said that He is the ocean of all the
relationships exchanged between two living entities, between the gods, or
between the Supreme Lord and His devotees.</p>
<p>It is said that Arjuna was inspired by the relationship of wonder, and in that
wonder, although he was by nature very sober, calm and quiet, he became
ecstatic, his hair stood up, and he began to offer his obeisances unto the
Supreme Lord with folded hands. He was not, of course, afraid. He was affected
by the wonders of the Supreme Lord. The immediate context is wonder; his natural
loving friendship was overwhelmed by wonder, and thus he reacted in this way.</p>

demigods and various other living entities. I see Brahmā sitting on the lotus
flower as well as Lord Śiva and many sages and divine serpents.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Arjuna sees everything in the universe; therefore he sees Brahmā, who is the
first creature in the universe, and the celestial serpent upon which the
Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu lies in the lower regions of the universe. This snake bed
is called Vāsuki. There are also other snakes known as Vāsuki. Arjuna can see
from the Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu up to the topmost part of the universe on the
lotus-flower planet where Brahmā, the first creature of the universe, resides.
That means that from the beginning to the end, everything could be seen by
Arjuna sitting in one place on his chariot. This was possible by the grace of
the Supreme Lord, Kṛṣṇa.</p>

statements are repeated over and over. That is not a flaw.</p>

Arjuna’s own soldiers are all being annihilated. This is an indication that
Arjuna will emerge victorious in battle, despite heavy losses on both sides. It
is also mentioned here that Bhīṣma, who is supposed to be unconquerable, will
also be smashed. So also Karṇa. Not only will the great warriors of the other
party like Bhīṣma be smashed, but some of the great warriors of Arjuna’s side
also.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Although Arjuna knew that Kṛṣṇa was his friend and the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, he was nonetheless puzzled by the various forms exhibited by Kṛṣṇa.
Therefore he asked further about the actual mission of this devastating force.
It is written in the Vedas that the Supreme Truth destroys everything, even
Brahmā. Yasya brahme ca kṣatram ca ubhe bhavata odanaḥ/mṛtyur yasyopasecanaṁ ka
itthā veda yatra saḥ. Eventually all the brāhmaṇas, kṣatriyas and everyone else
are devoured by the Supreme. This form of the Supreme Lord is an all-devouring
giant, and here Kṛṣṇa presents Himself in that form of all-devouring time.
Except for a few Pāṇḍavas, everyone who was present in that battlefield would be
devoured by Him.</p>
<p>Arjuna was not in favor of the fight, and he thought it was better not to fight;
then there would be no frustration. In reply, the Lord is saying that even if he
did not fight, every one of them would be destroyed, for that is His plan. If he
stopped fighting, they would die in another way. Death cannot be checked, even
if he did not fight. In fact, they were already dead. Time is destruction, and
all manifestations are to be vanquished by the desire of the Supreme Lord. That
is the law of nature.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Savyasācin refers to one who can shoot arrows very expertly in the field; thus
Arjuna is addressed as an expert warrior capable of delivering arrows to kill
his enemies. “Just become an instrument”: nimitta-mātram. This word is also very
significant. The whole world is moving according to the plan of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. Foolish persons who do not have sufficient knowledge
think that nature is moving without a plan and all manifestations are but
accidental formations. There are many so-called scientists who suggest that
perhaps it was like this, or maybe like that, but there is no question of
“perhaps” and “maybe.” There is a specific plan being carried out in this
material world. What is this plan? This cosmic manifestation is a chance for the
conditioned souls to go back to Godhead, back to home. As long they have the
domineering mentality which makes them try to lord it over material nature, they
are conditioned. But anyone who can understand the plan of the Supreme Lord and
cultivate Kṛṣṇa consciousness is most intelligent. The creation and destruction
of the cosmic manifestation are under the superior guidance of God. Thus the
Battle of Kurukṣetra was fought according to the plan of God. Arjuna was
refusing to fight, but he was told that he should fight and at the same time
desire the Supreme Lord. Then he would be happy. If one is in full Kṛṣṇa
consciousness and if his life is devoted to His transcendental service, he is
perfect.</p>

<p>Every plan is made by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but He is so kind and
merciful to His devotees that He wants to give the credit to His devotees who
carry out His plan according to His desire. Life should therefore move in such a
way that everyone acts in Kṛṣṇa consciousness and understands the Supreme
Personality of Godhead through the medium of a spiritual master. The plans of
the Supreme Personality of Godhead are understood by His mercy, and the plans of
the devotees are as good as His plans. One should follow such plans and be
victorious in the struggle for existence.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Arjuna, after hearing from Kṛṣṇa about the outcome of the Battle of Kurukṣetra,
became an enlightened devotee of the Supreme Lord. He admitted that everything
done by Kṛṣṇa is quite fit. Arjuna confirmed that Kṛṣṇa is the maintainer and
the object of worship for the devotees and the destroyer of the undesirables.
His actions are equally good for all. Arjuna understood herein that when the
Battle of Kurukṣetra was being concluded, in outer space there were present many
demigods, siddhas, and the intelligentia of the higher planets, and they were
observing the fight because Kṛṣṇa was present there. When Arjuna saw the
universal form of the Lord, the demigods took pleasure in it, but others, who
were demons and atheists, could not stand it when the Lord was praised. Out of
their natural fear of the devastating form of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, they fled. Kṛṣṇa’s treatment of the devotees and the atheists is
praised by Arjuna. In all cases a devotee glorifies the Lord because he knows
that whatever He does is good for all.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>By this offering of obeisances, Arjuna indicates that Kṛṣṇa is worshipable by
everyone. He is all-pervading, and He is the Soul of every soul. Arjuna is
addressing Kṛṣṇa as mahātmā, which means that He is most magnanimous and
unlimited. Ananta indicates that there is nothing which is not covered by the
influence and energy of the Supreme Lord, and deveśa means that He is the
controller of all demigods and is above them all. He is the center of the whole
universe. Arjuna also thought that it was fitting that all the perfect living
entities and all powerful demigods offer their respectful obeisances unto Him
because no one is greater than Him. He especially mentions that Kṛṣṇa is greater
than Brahmā because Brahmā is created by Him. Brahmā is born out of the lotus
stem grown from the navel abdomen of Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu, who is Kṛṣṇa’s
plenary expansion; therefore Brahmā and Lord Śiva, who is born of Brahmā, and
all other demigods must offer their respectful obeisances. Thus the Lord is
respected by Lord Śiva and Brahmā and similar other demigods. The word akṣaram
is very significant because this material creation is subject to destruction,
but the Lord is above this material creation. He is the cause of all causes, and
being so, He is superior to all the conditioned souls within this material
nature as well as the material cosmic manifestation itself. He is therefore the
all-great Supreme.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Although Kṛṣṇa is manifested before Arjuna in His universal form, Arjuna
remembers his friendly relationship with Kṛṣṇa and is therefore asking pardon
and requesting Him to excuse him for the many informal gestures which arise out
of friendship. He is admitting that formerly he did not know that Kṛṣṇa could
assume such a universal form, although He explained it as his intimate friend.
Arjuna did not know how many times he may have dishonored Him by addressing Him
as “O my friend, O Kṛṣṇa, O Yādava,” etc., without acknowledging His opulence.
But Kṛṣṇa is so kind and merciful that in spite of such opulence He played with
Arjuna as a friend. Such is the transcendental loving reciprocation between the
devotee and the Lord. The relationship between the living entity and Kṛṣṇa is
fixed eternally; it cannot be forgotten, as we can see from the behavior of
Arjuna. Although Arjuna has seen the opulence in the universal form, he could
not forget his friendly relationship with Kṛṣṇa.</p>

the spiritual master. No one is equal to You, nor can anyone be one with You.
Within the three worlds, You are immeasurable.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Lord Kṛṣṇa is worshipable as a father is worshipable for his son. He is the
spiritual master because He originally gave the Vedic instructions to Brahmā,
and presently He is also instructing Bhagavad-gītā to Arjuna; therefore He is
the original spiritual master, and any bona fide spiritual master at the present
moment must be a descendant in the line of disciplic succession stemming from
Kṛṣṇa. Without being a representative of Kṛṣṇa, one cannot become a teacher or
spiritual master of transcendental subject matter.</p>
<p>The Lord is being paid obeisances in all respects. He is of immeasurable
greatness. No one can be greater than the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa,
because no one is equal to or higher than Kṛṣṇa within any manifestation,
spiritual or material. Everyone is below Him. No one can excel Him.</p>
<p>The Supreme Lord Kṛṣṇa has senses and a body like the ordinary man, but for Him
there is no difference between His senses, body, mind and Himself. Foolish
persons who do not know Him perfectly say that Kṛṣṇa is different from His soul,
mind, heart and everything else. Kṛṣṇa is absolute; therefore His activities and
potencies are supreme. It is also stated that He does not have senses like ours.
He can perform all sensual activities; therefore His senses are neither
imperfect nor limited. No one can be greater than Him, no one can be equal to
Him, and everyone is lower than Him.</p>
<p>Whoever knows His transcendental body, activities and perfection, after quitting
his body, returns to Him and doesn’t come back again to this miserable world.
Therefore one should know that Kṛṣṇa’s activities are different from others. The
best policy is to follow the principles of Kṛṣṇa; that will make one perfect. It
is also stated that there is no one who is master of Kṛṣṇa; everyone is His
servant. Only Kṛṣṇa is God, and everyone is servant. Everyone is complying with
His order. There is no one who can deny His order. Everyone is acting according
to His direction, being under His superintendence. As stated in the
Brahmā-saṁhitā, He is the cause of all causes.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Arjuna is always in confidence with Kṛṣṇa because he is a very dear friend, and
as a dear friend is gladdened by his friend’s opulence, Arjuna is very joyful to
see that his friend, Kṛṣṇa, is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and can show
such a wonderful universal form. But at the same time, after seeing that
universal form, he is afraid that he has committed so many offenses to Kṛṣṇa out
of his unalloyed friendship. Thus his mind is disturbed out of fear, although he
had no reason to fear. Arjuna therefore is asking Kṛṣṇa to show His Nārāyaṇa
form because He can assume any form. This universal form is material and
temporary, as the material world is temporary. But in the Vaikuṇṭha planets He
has His transcendental form with four hands as Nārāyaṇa. There are innumerable
planets in the spiritual sky, and in each of them Kṛṣṇa is present by His
plenary manifestations of different names. Thus Arjuna desired to see one of the
forms manifest in the Vaikuṇṭha planets. Of course in each Vaikuṇṭha planet the
form of Nārāyaṇa is four-handed, and the four hands hold different symbols, the
conchshell, mace, lotus and disc. According to the different hands these four
things are held in, the Nārāyaṇas are named. All of these forms are one and the
same to Kṛṣṇa; therefore Arjuna requests to see His four-handed feature.</p>

<p>In the Brahmā-saṁhitā it is stated that the Lord is eternally situated in
hundreds and thousands of forms, and the main forms are those like Rāma,
Nṛsiṁha, Nārāyaṇa, etc. There are innumerable forms. But Arjuna knew that Kṛṣṇa
is the original Personality of Godhead assuming His temporary universal form. He
is now asking to see the form of Nārāyaṇa, a spiritual form. This verse
establishes without any doubt the statement of the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam that Kṛṣṇa
is the original Personality of Godhead and all other features originate from
Him. He is not different from His plenary expansions, and He is God in any of
His innumerable forms. In all of these forms He is fresh like a young man. That
is the constant feature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One who knows
Kṛṣṇa at once becomes free from all contamination of the material world.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Arjuna wanted to see the universal form of the Supreme Lord, so out of His mercy
upon His devotee Arjuna, Lord Kṛṣṇa showed His universal form full of effulgence
and opulence. This form was glaring like the sun, and its many faces were
rapidly changing. Kṛṣṇa showed this form just to satisfy the desire of His
friend Arjuna. This form was manifested by Kṛṣṇa through His internal potency,
which is inconceivable by human speculation. No one had seen this universal form
of the Lord before Arjuna, but because the form was shown to Arjuna, other
devotees in the heavenly planets and in other planets in outer space could also
see it. They did not see it before, but because of Arjuna they were also able to
see it. In other words, all the disciplic devotees of the Lord could see the
universal form which was shown to Arjuna by the mercy of Kṛṣṇa. Someone
commented that this form was shown to Duryodhana also when Kṛṣṇa went to
Duryodhana to negotiate for peace. Unfortunately, Duryodhana did not accept the
peace offer, but at that time Kṛṣṇa manifested some of His universal forms. But
those forms are different from this one shown to Arjuna. It is clearly said that
no one has ever seen this form before.</p>

charities or similar activities can this form be seen. Only you have seen this.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The divine vision in this connection should be clearly understood. Who can have
divine vision? Divine means godly. Unless one attains the status of divinity as
a demigod, he cannot have divine vision. And what is a demigod? It is stated in
the Vedic scriptures that those who are devotees of Lord Viṣṇu are demigods.
Those who are atheistic, i.e., who do not believe in Viṣṇu, or who only
recognize the impersonal part of Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme, cannot have the divine
vision. It is not possible to decry Kṛṣṇa and at the same time have the divine
vision. One cannot have the divine vision without becoming divine. In other
words, those who have divine vision can also see like Arjuna.</p>
<p>The Bhagavad-gītā gives the description of the universal form, and this
description was unknown to everyone before Arjuna. Now one can have some idea of
the viśva-rūpa after this incidence; those who are actually divine can see the
universal form of the Lord. But one cannot be divine without being a pure
devotee of Kṛṣṇa. The devotees, however, who are actually in the divine nature
and who have divine vision, are not very much interested to see the universal
form of the Lord. As described in the previous verse, Arjuna desired to see the
four-handed form of Lord Kṛṣṇa as Viṣṇu, and he was actually afraid of the
universal form.</p>
<p>In this verse there are some significant words, just like veda-yajñādhya-yanaiḥ,
which refers to studying Vedic literature and the subject matter of sacrificial
regulations. Veda refers to all kinds of Vedic literature, namely the four Vedas
(Ṛk, Yajus, Sāma and Atharva) and the eighteen Purāṇas and Upaniṣads, and
Vedānta-sūtra. One can study these at home or anywhere else. Similarly, there
are sūtras, Kalpa-sūtras and Mīmāṁsā-sūtras, for studying the method of
sacrifice. Dānaiḥ refers to charity which is offered to a suitable party. such
as those who are engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, the
brāhmaṇas and the Vaiṣṇavas. Similarly, pious activities refer to the
agni-hotra, etc., the prescribed duties of the different castes. Pious
activities and the voluntary acceptance of some bodily pains are called tapasya.
So one can perform all these, can accept bodily penances, give charity, study
the Vedas, etc., but unless he is a devotee like Arjuna, it is not possible to
see that universal form. Those who are impersonalists are also imagining that
they are seeing the universal form of the Lord, but from Bhagavad-gītā we
understand that the impersonalists are not devotees. Therefore they are unable
to see the universal form of the Lord.</p>
<p>There are many persons who create incarnations. They falsely claim an ordinary
human to be an incarnation, but this is all foolishness. We should follow the
principles of Bhagavad-gītā, otherwise there is no possibility of attaining
perfect spiritual knowledge. Although Bhagavad-gītā is considered the
preliminary study of the science of God, still it is so perfect that one can
distinguish what is what. The followers of a pseudo incarnation may say that
they have also seen the transcendental incarnation of God, the universal form,
but that is not acceptable because it is clearly stated here that unless one
becomes a devotee of Kṛṣṇa, one cannot see the universal form of God. So one
first of all has to become a pure devotee of Kṛṣṇa; then he can claim that he
can show the universal form of what he has seen. A devotee of Kṛṣṇa cannot
accept false incarnations or followers of false incarnations.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In the beginning of Bhagavad-gītā Arjuna was worried about killing Bhīṣma and
Droṇa, his worshipful grandfathers and masters. But Kṛṣṇa said that he need not
be afraid of killing his grandfather. When they tried to disrobe Draupadī in the
assembly, Bhīṣma and Droṇa were silent, and for such negligence of duty they
should be killed. Kṛṣṇa showed His universal form to Arjuna just to show him
that these people were already killed for their unlawful action. That scene was
shown to Arjuna because devotees are always peaceful, and they cannot perform
such horrible actions. The purpose of the revelation of the universal form was
shown; now Arjuna wanted to see the four-armed form, and Kṛṣṇa showed him. A
devotee is not much interested in the universal form, for it does not enable one
to reciprocate loving feelings. A devotee wants to offer his respectful
worshiping feelings; thus he wants to see the two-handed or four-handed Kṛṣṇa
form so he can reciprocate in loving service with the Supreme Personality of
Godhead.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>When Kṛṣṇa appeared as the son of Vasudeva and Devakī, He first of all appeared
as four-armed Nārāyaṇa, but when He was requested by His parents, He transformed
Himself into an ordinary child in appearance. Similarly, Kṛṣṇa knew that Arjuna
was not interested in seeing a four-handed form of Kṛṣṇa, but since he asked to
see this four-handed form, He also showed him this form again and then showed
Himself in His two-handed form. The word saumya-vapuḥ is very significant.
Saumya-vapu is a very beautiful form; it is known as the most beautiful form.
When He was present, everyone was attracted simply by Kṛṣṇa’s form, and because
Kṛṣṇa is director of the universe, He just banished the fear of Arjuna, His
devotee, and showed him again His beautiful form of Kṛṣṇa. In the Brahma-saṁhitā
it is stated that only a person whose eyes are smeared with the ointment of love
can see the beautiful form of Śrī Kṛṣṇa.</p>

human being, then how is it possible for Him to show the universal form and
again to show the four-handed Nārāyaṇa form? So it is very clearly stated in
Bhagavad-gītā that one who thinks that Kṛṣṇa is an ordinary person and misguides
the reader by claiming that it is the impersonal Brahman within Kṛṣṇa speaking,
is doing the greatest injustice. Kṛṣṇa has actually shown His universal form and
His fourhanded Viṣṇu form. So how can He be an ordinary human being? A pure
devotee is not confused by misguiding commentaries on Bhagavad-gītā because he
knows what is what. The original verses of Bhagavad-gītā are as clear as the
sun; they do not require lamplight from foolish commentators.</p>

<p>The Blessed Lord said: My dear Arjuna, the form which you are now seeing is very
difficult to behold. Even the demigods are ever seeking the opportunity to see
this form which is so dear.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In the forty-eighth verse of this chapter Lord Kṛṣṇa concluded revealing His
universal form and informed Arjuna that this form is not possible to be seen by
so many activities, sacrifices, etc. Now here the word sudurdarśam is used,
indicating that Kṛṣṇa’s two-handed form is still more confidential. One may be
able to see the universal form of Kṛṣṇa by adding a little tinge of devotional
service to various activities like penance, Vedic study and philosophical
speculation, etc. It may be possible, but without a tinge of bhakti, one cannot
see; that has already been explained. Still, beyond that universal form, the
form of Kṛṣṇa as a two-handed man is still more difficult to see, even for
demigods like Brahmā and Lord Śiva. They desire to see Him, and we have
evidences in the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam that when He was supposed to be in the womb
of His mother, Devakī, all the demigods from heaven came to see the marvel of
Kṛṣṇa. They even waited to see Him. A foolish person may deride Him, but that is
an ordinary person. Kṛṣṇa is actually desired to be seen by demigods like Brahmā
and Śiva in His two-armed form.</p>
<p>In Bhagavad-gītā it is also confirmed that He is not visible to the foolish
persons who deride Him. Kṛṣṇa’s body, as confirmed by Brahmā-saṁhitā and
confirmed by Himself in Bhagavad-gītā, is completely spiritual and full of bliss
and eternality. His body is never like a material body. But for some who make a
study of Kṛṣṇa by reading Bhagavad-gītā or similar Vedic scriptures, Kṛṣṇa is a
problem. For one using a material process, Kṛṣṇa is considered to be a great
historical personality and very learned philosopher. But He isn’t an ordinary
man. But some think that even though He was so powerful, He had to accept a
material body. Ultimately they think that the Absolute Truth is impersonal;
therefore they think that from His impersonal feature He assumed a personal
feature attached to material nature. This is a materialistic calculation of the
Supreme Lord. Another calculation is speculative. Those who are in search of
knowledge also speculate on Kṛṣṇa and consider Him to be less important than the
universal form of the Supreme. Thus some think that the universal form of Kṛṣṇa
which was manifested to Arjuna is more important than His personal form.
According to them, the personal form of the Supreme is something imaginary. They
believe that in the ultimate issue, the Absolute Truth is not a person. But the
transcendental process is described in Bhagavad-gītā, Chapter Two: to hear about
Kṛṣṇa from authorities. That is the actual Vedic process, and those who are
actually in the Vedic line hear about Kṛṣṇa from authority, and by repeated
hearing about Him, Kṛṣṇa becomes dear. As we have several times discussed, Kṛṣṇa
is covered by His yoga-māyā potency. He is not to be seen or revealed to anyone
and everyone. Only by one to whom He reveals Himself can He be seen. This is
confirmed in Vedic literature; for one who is a surrendered soul, the Absolute
Truth can actually be understood. The transcendentalist, by continuous Kṛṣṇa
consciousness and by devotional service to Kṛṣṇa, can have his spiritual eyes
opened and can see Kṛṣṇa by revelation. Such a revelation is not possible even
for the demigods; therefore it is difficult even for the demigods to understand
Kṛṣṇa, and the advanced demigods are always in hope of seeing Kṛṣṇa in His
two-handed form. The conclusion is that although to see the universal form of
Kṛṣṇa is very, very difficult and not possible for anyone and everyone, it is
still more difficult to understand His personal form as Śyāmasundara.</p>

<p>Kṛṣṇa first appeared before His parents Devakī and Vasudeva in a four-handed
form, and then He transformed Himself into the two-handed form. This mystery is
very difficult to understand for those who are atheists or who are devoid of
devotional service. For scholars who have simply studied Vedic literature by way
of speculation or out of mere academic interest, Kṛṣṇa is not easy to
understand. Nor is He to he understood by persons who officially go to the
temple to offer worship. They make their visit, but they cannot understand Kṛṣṇa
as He is. Kṛṣṇa can be understood only through the path of devotional service,
as explained by Kṛṣṇa Himself in the next verse.</p>

<p>My dear Arjuna, only by undivided devotional service can I be understood as I
am, standing before you, and can thus be seen directly. Only in this way can you
enter into the mysteries of My understanding.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Kṛṣṇa can be understood only by the process of undivided devotional service. He
explicitly explains this in this verse so unauthorized commentators, who try to
understand Bhagavad-gītā by the speculative process, will know that they are
simply wasting their time. No one can understand Kṛṣṇa or how He came from
parents in a four-handed form and at once changed Himself into a two-handed
form. It is clearly stated here that no one can see Him. Those who, however, are
very experienced students of Vedic literature can learn about Him from the Vedic
literature in so many ways. There are so many rules and regulations, and if one
at all wants to understand Kṛṣṇa, he must follow the regulative principles
described in the authoritative literature. One can perform penance in accordance
with those principles. As far as charity is concerned, it is plain that charity
should be given to the devotees of Kṛṣṇa who are engaged in His devotional
service to spread the Kṛṣṇa philosophy or Kṛṣṇa consciousness throughout the
world. Kṛṣṇa consciousness is a benediction to humanity. Lord Caitanya was
appreciated by Rūpa Gosvāmī as the most munificent man of charity because love
of Kṛṣṇa, which is very difficult to achieve, was distributed freely by Him. And
if one worships as prescribed in the temple (in the temples in India there is
always some statue, usually of Viṣṇu or Kṛṣṇa), that is a chance to progress.
For the beginners in devotional service to the Lord, temple worship is very
essential, and this is confirmed in the Vedic literature.</p>
<p>One who has unflinching devotion for the Supreme Lord and is directed by the
spiritual master can see the Supreme Personality of Godhead by revelation. For
one who does not take personal training under the guidance of a bona fide
spiritual master, it is impossible to even begin to understand Kṛṣṇa. The word
tu is specifically used here to indicate that no other process can be used, can
be recommended, or can be successful in understanding Kṛṣṇa.</p>
<p>The personal forms of Kṛṣṇa, the two-handed form and the four-handed, are
completely different from the temporary universal form shown to Arjuna. The
four-handed form is Nārāyaṇa, and the two-handed form is Kṛṣṇa; they are eternal
and transcendental, whereas the universal form exhibited to Arjuna is temporary.
The very word sudurdarśam, meaning difficult to see, suggests that no one saw
that universal form. It also suggests that amongst the devotees there was no
necessity of showing it. That form was exhibited by Kṛṣṇa at the request of
Arjuna because in the future, when one represents himself as an incarnation of
God, people can ask to see his universal form.</p>
<p>Kṛṣṇa changes from the universal form to the four-handed form of Nārāyaṇa and
then to His own natural form of two hands. This indicates that the four-handed
forms and other forms mentioned in Vedic literature are all emanations of the
original two-handed Kṛṣṇa. He is the origin of all emanations. Kṛṣṇa is distinct
even from these forms, not to speak of the impersonal conception. As far as the
four-handed forms of Kṛṣṇa are concerned, it is stated clearly that even the
most identical four-handed form of Kṛṣṇa (which is known as Mahā-Viṣṇu, who is
lying on the cosmic ocean and from whose breathing so many innumerable universes
are passing out and entering) is also an expansion of the Supreme Lord.
Therefore one should conclusively worship the personal form of Kṛṣṇa as the
Supreme Personality of Godhead who is eternity, bliss and knowledge. He is the
source of all forms of Viṣṇu, He is the source of all forms of incarnation, and
He is the original Supreme Personality, as confirmed in Bhagavad-gītā.</p>
<p>In the Vedic literature it is stated that the Supreme Absolute Truth is a
person. His name is Kṛṣṇa, and He sometimes descends on this earth. Similarly,
in Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam there is a description of all kinds of incarnations of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, and there it is said that Kṛṣṇa is not an
incarnation of God but is the original Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself.
Kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam. Similarly, in Bhagavad-gītā the Lord says, mattaḥ
parataram nānyāt: “There is nothing superior to My form as the Personality of
Godhead Kṛṣṇa.” He also says elsewhere in Bhagavad-gītā, aham ādir hi devānām:
“I am the origin of all the demigods.” And after understanding Bhagavad-gītā
from Kṛṣṇa, Arjuna also confirms this in the following words: paraṁ brahma paraṁ
dhāma pavitraṁ paramaṁ bhavān: “I now fully understand that You are the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth, and that You are the refuge of
everything.” Therefore the universal form which Kṛṣṇa showed to Arjuna is not
the original form of God. The original is the Kṛṣṇa form. The universal form,
with its thousands and thousands of heads and hands, is manifest just to draw
the attention of those who have no love for God. It is not God’s original form.</p>
<p>The universal form is not attractive for pure devotees, who are in love with the
Lord in different transcendental relationships. The Supreme Godhead exchanges
transcendental love in His original form of Kṛṣṇa. Therefore to Arjuna, who was
so intimately related with Kṛṣṇa in friendship, this form of the universal
manifestation was not pleasing; rather, it was fearful. Arjuna, who is a
constant companion of Kṛṣṇa’s, must have had transcendental eyes; he was not an
ordinary man. Therefore he was not captivated by the universal form. This form
may seem wonderful to persons who are involved in elevating themselves by
fruitive activities, but to persons who are engaged in devotional service, the
two-handed form of Kṛṣṇa is the most dear.</p>

<p>My dear Arjuna, one who is engaged in My pure devotional service, free from the

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Anyone who wants to approach the Supreme of all the Personalities of Godhead, on
the Kṛṣṇaloka planet in the spiritual sky, and be intimately connected with the
Supreme Personality, Kṛṣṇa, must take this formula, as is stated by the Supreme
Himself. Therefore, this verse is considered to be the essence of Bhagavad-gītā.
The Bhagavad-gītā is a book directed to the conditioned souls, who are engaged
in the material world with the purpose of lording it over nature and who do not
know of the real, spiritual life. The Bhagavad-gītā is meant to show how one can
understand his spiritual existence and his eternal relationship with the Supreme
Spiritual Personality and to teach one how to go back home, back to Godhead. Now
here is the verse which clearly explains the process by which one can attain
success in his spiritual activity: devotional service. As far as work is
concerned, one should transfer his energy entirely to Kṛṣṇa conscious
activities. No work should be done by any man except in relationship to Kṛṣṇa.
This called Kṛṣṇa-karma. One may be engaged in various activities, but one
should not be attached to the result of his work, but the result should be done
for Him. For example, one may be engaged in business, but to transform that
activity into Kṛṣṇa consciousness, one has to do business for Kṛṣṇa. If Kṛṣṇa is
the proprietor of the business, then Kṛṣṇa should enjoy the profit of the
business. If a businessman is in possession of thousands and thousands of
dollars, and if he has to offer all this to Kṛṣṇa, he can do it. This is work
for Kṛṣṇa. Instead of constructing a big building for his sense gratification,
he can construct a nice temple for Kṛṣṇa, and he can install the Deity of Kṛṣṇa
and arrange for the Deity’s service, as is outlined in the authorized books of
devotional service. This is all Kṛṣṇa-karma. One should not be attached to the
result of his work, but the result should be offered to Kṛṣṇa. One should also
accept as prasādam, food, the remnants of offerings to Kṛṣṇa. If, however, one
is not able to construct a temple for Kṛṣṇa, one can engage himself in cleansing
the temple of Kṛṣṇa; that is also Kṛṣṇa-karma. One can cultivate a garden.
Anyone who has land—in India, at least, any poor man has a certain amount of
land—can utilize that for Kṛṣṇa by growing flowers to offer Him. He can sow
tulasī plants because tulasī leaves are very important, and Kṛṣṇa has
recommended this in Bhagavad-gītā. Kṛṣṇa desires that one offer Him either a
leaf, or a flower, or a little water—and He is satisfied. This leaf especially
refers to the tulasī So one can sow tulasī leaves and pour water on the plant.
Thus, even the poorest man can engage in the service of Kṛṣṇa. These are some of
the examples of how one can engage in working for Kṛṣṇa.</p>
<p>The word mat-paramaḥ refers to one who considers the association of Kṛṣṇa in His
supreme abode to be the highest perfection of life. Such a person does not wish
to be elevated to the higher planets such as the moon or sun or heavenly
planets, or even the highest planet of this universe, Brahmaloka. He has no
attraction for that. He is only attracted to being transferred to the spiritual
sky. And even in the spiritual sky he is not satisfied with merging into the
glowing brahmajyoti effulgence, for he wants to enter the highest spiritual
planet, namely Kṛṣṇaloka, Goloka Vṛndāvana. He has full knowledge of that
planet, and therefore he is not interested in any other. As indicated by the
word mad-bhaktaḥ, he fully engages in devotional service, specifically in the
nine processes of devotional engagement: hearing, chanting, remembering,
worshiping, serving the lotus feet of the Lord, offering prayers, carrying out
the orders of the Lord, making friends with Him, and surrendering everything to
Him. One can engage in all nine devotional processes, or eight, or seven, or at
least in one, and that will surely make one perfect.</p>
<p>The term saṅga-varjitaḥ is very significant. One should disassociate himself
from persons who are against Kṛṣṇa. Not only are the atheistic persons against
Kṛṣṇa, but also those who are attracted to fruitive activities and mental
speculation. Therefore the pure form of devotional service is described in
Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu as follows: anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyaṁ jñāna-karmādy-anāvṛtam
ānukūlyena kṛṣṇānuśīlanaṁ bhaktir uttamā. In this verse Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī
clearly states that if anyone wants to execute unalloyed devotional service, he
must be freed from all kinds of material contamination. He must be freed from
the association of persons who are addicted to fruitive activities and mental
speculation. When, freed from such unwanted association and from the
contamination of material desires, one favorably cultivates knowledge of Kṛṣṇa,
that is called pure devotional service. Ānukūlyasya saṅkaplaḥ prātikūlyasya
varjanam. One should think of Kṛṣṇa and act for Kṛṣṇa favorably, not
unfavorably. Kaṁsa was an enemy of Kṛṣṇa’s. From the very beginning of Kṛṣṇa’s
birth, he planned in so many ways to kill Him, and because he was always
unsuccessful, he was always thinking of Kṛṣṇa. Thus while working, while eating
and while sleeping, he was always Kṛṣṇa conscious in every respect, but that
Kṛṣṇa consciousness was not favorable, and therefore in spite of his always
thinking of Kṛṣṇa twenty-four hours a day, he was considered a demon, and Kṛṣṇa
at last killed him. Of course anyone who is killed by Kṛṣṇa attains salvation
immediately, but that is not the aim of the pure devotee. The pure devotee does
not even want salvation. He does not want to be transferred even to the highest
planet, Goloka Vṛndāvana. His only objective is to serve Kṛṣṇa wherever he may
be.</p>
<p>A devotee of Kṛṣṇa is friendly to everyone. Therefore it is said here that he
has no enemy. How is this? A devotee situated in Kṛṣṇa consciousness knows that
only devotional service to Kṛṣṇa can relieve a person from all the problems of
life. He has personal experience of this, and therefore he wants to introduce
this system, Kṛṣṇa consciousness, into human society. There are many examples in
history of devotees of the Lord risking their lives for the spreading of God
consciousness. The favorite example is Lord Jesus Christ. He was crucified by
the nondevotees, but He sacrificed His life for spreading God consciousness. Of
course, it would be superficial to understand that He was killed. Similarly, in
India also there are many examples, such as Ṭhākur Haridāsa. Why such risk?
Because they wanted to spread Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and it is difficult. A Kṛṣṇa
conscious person knows that if a man is suffering, it is due to his
forgetfulness of his eternal relationship with Kṛṣṇa. Therefore, the highest
benefit one can render to human society is relieving one’s neighbor from all
material problems. In such a way, a pure devotee is engaged in the service of
the Lord. Now, we can imagine how merciful Kṛṣṇa is to those engaged in His
service, risking everything for Him. Therefore it is certain that such persons
must reach the supreme planet after leaving the body.</p>
<p>In summary, the universal form of Kṛṣṇa, which is a temporary manifestation, and
the form of time which devours everything, and even the form of Viṣṇu,
four-handed, have all been exhibited by Kṛṣṇa. Thus Kṛṣṇa is the origin of all
these manifestations. It is not that Kṛṣṇa is a manifestation of the original
viśva-rūpa, or Viṣṇu. Kṛṣṇa is the origin of all forms. There are hundreds and
thousands of Viṣṇus, but for a devotee, no form of Kṛṣṇa is important but the
original form, two-handed Śyāmasundara. In the Brahmā-saṁhitā it is stated that
those who are attached to the Śyāmasundara form of Kṛṣṇa in love and devotion
can see Him always within the heart and cannot see anything else. One should
understand, therefore, that the purport of this Eleventh Chapter is that the
form of Kṛṣṇa is essential and supreme.</p>
