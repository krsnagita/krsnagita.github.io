<p>arjunaḥ uvāca—Arjuna said; sannyāsam—renunciation; karmaṇām—of all activities;
kṛṣṇa—O Kṛṣṇa; punaḥ—again; yogam—devotional service; ca—also; śaṁsasi—You are
praising; yat—which; śreyaḥ—is beneficial; etayoḥ—of these two; ekam—one;

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Arjuna said: O Kṛṣṇa, first of all You ask me to renounce work, and then again
You recommend work with devotion. Now will You kindly tell me definitely which
of the two is more beneficial?</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In this Fifth Chapter of the Bhagavad-gītā, the Lord says that work in
devotional service is better than dry mental speculation. Devotional service is
easier than the latter because, being transcendental in nature, it frees one
from reaction. In the Second Chapter, preliminary knowledge of the soul and its
entanglement in the material body were explained. How to get out of this
material encagement by buddhi-yoga, or devotional service, was also explained
therein. In the Third Chapter, it was explained that a person who is situated on
the platform of knowledge no longer has any duties to perform. And, in the
Fourth Chapter, the Lord told Arjuna that all kinds of sacrificial work
culminate in knowledge. However, at the end of the Fourth Chapter, the Lord
advised Arjuna to wake up and fight, being situated in perfect knowledge.
Therefore, by simultaneously stressing the importance of both work in devotion
and inaction in knowledge, Kṛṣṇa has perplexed Arjuna and confused his
determination. Arjuna understands that renunciation in knowledge involves
cessation of all kinds of work performed as sense activities. But if one
performs work in devotional service, then how is work stopped? In other words,
he thinks that sannyāsam, or renunciation in knowledge, should be altogether
free from all kinds of activity because work and renunciation appear to him to
be incompatible. He appears not to have understood that work in full knowledge
is nonreactive and is therefore the same as inaction. He inquires, therefore,
whether he should cease work altogether, or work with full knowledge.</p>

work; karma-yogaḥ—work in devotion; ca—also; niḥśreyasa-karau—all leading to the
path of liberation; ubhau—both; tayoḥ—of the two; tu—but; karma-sannyāsāt—in

viśiṣyate—is better.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The Blessed Lord said: The renunciation of work and work in devotion are both
good for liberation. But, of the two, work in devotional service is better than
renunciation of works.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Fruitive activities (seeking sense gratification) are cause for material
bondage. As long as one is engaged in activities aimed at improving the standard
of bodily comfort, one is sure to transmigrate to different types of bodies,
thereby continuing material bondage perpetually. Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam confirms this
as follows:</p>
<p>nūnaṁ pramattaḥ kurute vikarma yad indriya-prītaya āpṛṇoti na sādhu manye yata
ātmano ’yam asann api kleśada āsa dehaḥ</p>
<p>parābhavas tāvad abodha-jāto yāvanna jijñāsata ātma-tattvam yāvat kriyās tāvad
idaṁ mano vai karmātmakaṁ yena śarīra-bandhaḥ</p>
<p>evaṁ manaḥ karma-vaśaṁ prayuṅkte avidyayātmany upadhīyamāne prītir na yāvan mayi
vāsudeve na mucyate deha-yogena tāvat</p>
<p>“People are mad after sense gratification, and they do not know that this
present body, which is full of miseries, is a result of one’s fruitive
activities in the past. Although this body is temporary, it is always giving one
trouble in many ways. Therefore, to act for sense gratification is not good. One
is considered to be a failure in life as long as he makes no inquiry about the
nature of work for fruitive results, for as long as one is engrossed in the
consciousness of sense gratification, one has to transmigrate from one body to
another. Although the mind may be engrossed in fruitive activities and
influenced by ignorance, one must develop a love for devotional service to
Vāsudeva. Only then can one have the opportunity to get out of the bondage of
material existence.” (Bhāg. 5.5.4-6)</p>
<p>Therefore, jñāna (or knowledge that one is not this material body but spirit
soul) is not sufficient for liberation. One has to act in the status of spirit
soul, otherwise there is no escape from material bondage. Action in Kṛṣṇa
consciousness is not, however, action on the fruitive platform. Activities
performed in full knowledge strengthen one’s advancement in real knowledge.
Without Kṛṣṇa consciousness, mere renunciation of fruitive activities does not
actually purify the heart of a conditioned soul. As long as the heart is not
purified, one has to work on the fruitive platform. But action in Kṛṣṇa
consciousness automatically helps one escape the result of fruitive action so
that one need not descend to the material platform. Therefore, action in Kṛṣṇa
consciousness is always superior to renunciation, which always entails a risk of
falling. Renunciation without Kṛṣṇa consciousness is incomplete, as is confirmed
by Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī in his Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu.</p>
<p>prāpañcikatayā buddhyā hari-sambandhi-vastunaḥ mumukṣubhiḥ parityāgo vairāgyaṁ
phalgu kathyate.</p>
<p>“Renunciation by persons eager to achieve liberation of things which are related
to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, though they are material, is called
incomplete renunciation.” Renunciation is compete when it is in the knowledge
that everything in existence belongs to the Lord and that no one should claim
proprietorship over anything. One should understand that, factually, nothing
belongs to anyone. Then where is the question of renunciation? One who knows
that everything is Kṛṣṇa’s property is always situated in renunciation. Since
everything belongs to Kṛṣṇa, everything should be employed in the service of
Kṛṣṇa. This perfect form of action in Kṛṣṇa consciousness is far better than any
amount of artificial renunciation by a sannyāsī of the Māyāvādī school.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>One who neither hates nor desires the fruits of his activities is known to be
always renounced. Such a person, liberated from all dualities, easily overcomes
material bondage and is completely liberated, O mighty-armed Arjuna.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>One who is fully in Kṛṣṇa consciousness is always a renouncer because he feels
neither hatred nor desire for the results of his actions. Such a renouncer,
dedicated to the transcendental loving service of the Lord, is fully qualified
in knowledge because he knows his constitutional position in his relationship
with Kṛṣṇa. He knows fully well that Kṛṣṇa is the whole and that he is part and
parcel of Kṛṣṇa. Such knowledge is perfect because it is qualitatively and
quantitatively correct. The concept of oneness with Kṛṣṇa is incorrect because
the part cannot be equal to the whole. Knowledge that one is one in quality yet
different in quantity is correct transcendental knowledge leading one to become
full in himself, having nothing to aspire to nor lament over. There is no
duality in his mind because whatever he does, he does for Kṛṣṇa. Being thus
freed from the platform of dualities, he is liberated—even in this material
world.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Only the ignorant speak of karma-yoga and devotional service as being different
from the analytical study of the material world [sāṅkhya]. Those who are
actually learned say that he who applies himself well to one of these paths
achieves the results of both.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The aim of the analytical study of the material world is to find the soul of
existence. The soul of the material world is Viṣṇu, or the Supersoul. Devotional
service to the Lord entails service to the Supersoul. One process is to find the
root of the tree, and next to water the root. The real student of sāṅkhya
philosophy finds the root of the material world, Viṣṇu, and then, in perfect
knowledge, engages himself in the service of the Lord. Therefore, in essence,
there is no difference between the two because the aim of both is Viṣṇu. Those
who do not know the ultimate end say that the purposes of sāṅkhya and karma-yoga
are not the same, but one who is learned knows the unifying aim in these
different processes.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>One who knows that the position reached by means of renunciation can also be
attained by works in devotional service and who therefore sees that the path of
works and the path of renunciation are one, sees things as they are.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The real purpose of philosophical research is to find the ultimate goal of life.
Since the ultimate goal of life is self-realization, there is no difference
between the conclusions reached by the two processes. By sāṅkhya philosophical
research one comes to the conclusion that a living entity is not a part and
parcel of the material world, but of the supreme spirit whole. Consequently, the
spirit soul has nothing to do with the material world; his actions must be in
some relation with the Supreme. When he acts in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he is
actually in his constitutional position. In the first process of sāṅkhya, one
has to become detached from matter, and in the devotional yoga process one has
to attach himself to the work of Kṛṣṇa. Factually, both processes are the same,
although superficially one process appears to involve detachment and the other
process appears to involve attachment. However, detachment from matter and
attachment to Kṛṣṇa are one and the same. One who can see this sees things as
they are.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Unless one is engaged in the devotional service of the Lord, mere renunciation
of activities cannot make one happy. The sages, purified by works of devotion,
achieve the Supreme without delay.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>There are two classes of sannyāsīs, or persons in the renounced order of life.
The Māyāvādī sannyāsīs are engaged in the study of sāṅkhya philosophy, whereas
the Vaisnava sannyāsīs are engaged in the study of Bhāgavatam philosophy, which
affords the proper commentary on the Vedānta-sūtras. The Māyāvādī sannyāsīs also
study the Vedānta-sūtras, but use their own commentary, called Śārīraka-bhāṣya,
written by Śaṅkarācārya. The students of the Bhāgavata school are engaged in
devotional service of the Lord, according to pāñcarātrikī regulations, and
therefore the Vaiṣṇava sannyāsīs have multiple engagements in the transcendental
service of the Lord. The Vaiṣṇava sannyāsīs have nothing to do with material
activities, and yet they perform various activities in their devotional service
to the Lord. But the Māyāvādī sannyāsīs, engaged in the studies of sāṅkhya and
Vedānta and speculation, cannot relish transcendental service of the Lord.
Because their studies become very tedious, they sometimes become tired of
Brahman speculation, and thus they take shelter of the Bhāgavatam without proper
understanding. Consequently their study of the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam becomes
troublesome. Dry speculations and impersonal interpretations by artificial means
are all useless for the Māyāvādī sannyāsīs. The Vaiṣṇava sannyāsīs, who are
engaged in devotional service, are happy in the discharge of their
transcendental duties, and they have the guarantee of ultimate entrance into the
kingdom of God. The Māyāvādī sannyāsīs sometimes fall down from the path of
self-realization and again enter into material activities of a philanthropic and
altruistic nature, which are nothing but material engagements. Therefore, the
conclusion is that those who are engaged in Kṛṣṇa consciousness are better
situated than the sannyāsīs engaged in simple Brahman speculation, although they
too come to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, after many births.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>One who works in devotion, who is a pure soul, and who controls his mind and
senses, is dear to everyone, and everyone is dear to him. Though always working,
such a man is never entangled.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>One who is on the path of liberation by Kṛṣṇa consciousness is very dear to
every living being, and every living being is dear to him. This is due to his
Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Such a person cannot think of any living being as separate
from Kṛṣṇa, just as the leaves and branches of a tree are not separate from the
tree. He knows very well that by pouring water on the root of the tree, the
water will be distributed to all the leaves and branches, or by supplying food
to the stomach, the energy is automatically distributed throughout the body.
Because one who works in Kṛṣṇa consciousness is servant to all, he is very dear
to everyone. And, because everyone is satisfied by his work, he is pure in
consciousness. Because he is pure in consciousness, his mind is completely
controlled. And, because his mind is controlled, his senses are also controlled.
Because his mind is always fixed on Kṛṣṇa, there is no chance of his being
deviated from Kṛṣṇa. Nor is there a chance that he will engage his senses in
matters other than the service of the Lord. He does not like to hear anything
except topics relating to Kṛṣṇa; he does not like to eat anything which is not
offered to Kṛṣṇa; and he does not wish to go anywhere if Kṛṣṇa is not involved.
Therefore, his senses are controlled. A man of controlled senses cannot be
offensive to anyone. One may ask, “Why then was Arjuna offensive (in battle) to
others? Wasn’t he in Kṛṣṇa consciousness?” Arjuna was only superficially
offensive because (as has already been explained in the Second Chapter) all the
assembled persons on the battlefield would continue to live individually, as the
soul cannot be slain. So, spiritually, no one was killed on the Battlefield of
Kurukṣetra. Only their dresses were changed by the order of Kṛṣṇa, who was
personally present. Therefore Arjuna, while fighting on the Battlefield of
Kurukṣetra, was not really fighting at all; he was simply carrying out the
orders of Kṛṣṇa in full Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Such a person is never entangled in
the reactions of work.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>A person in the divine consciousness, although engaged in seeing, hearing,
touching, smelling, eating, moving about, sleeping, and breathing, always knows
within himself that he actually does nothing at all. Because while speaking,
evacuating, receiving, opening or closing his eyes, he always knows that only
the material senses are engaged with their objects and that he is aloof from
them.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>A person in Kṛṣṇa consciousness is pure in his existence, and consequently he
has nothing to do with any work which depends upon five immediate and remote
causes: the doer, the work, the situation, the endeavor and fortune. This is
because he is engaged in the loving transcendental service of Kṛṣṇa. Although he
appears to be acting with his body and senses, he is always conscious of his
actual position, which is spiritual engagement. In material consciousness, the
senses are engaged in sense gratification, but in Kṛṣṇa consciousness the senses
are engaged in the satisfaction of Kṛṣṇa’s senses. Therefore, the Kṛṣṇa
conscious person is always free, even though he appears to be engaged in things
of the senses. Activities such as seeing, hearing, speaking, evacuating, etc.,
are actions of the senses meant for work. A Kṛṣṇa consciousness person is never
affected by the actions of the senses. He cannot perform any act except in the
service of the Lord because he knows that he is the eternal servitor of the
Lord.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>One who performs his duty without attachment, surrendering the results unto the
Supreme God, is not affected by sinful action, as the lotus leaf is untouched by
water.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Here brahmaṇi means in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. The material world is a sum total
manifestation of the three modes of material nature, technically called the
pradhāna. The Vedic hymns, sarvam etad brahma, tasmād etad brahma nāma-rūpam
annaṁ ca jāyate, and, in the Bhagavad-gītā, mama yonir mahad brahma, indicate
that everything in the material world is the manifestation of Brahman; and,
although the effects are differently manifested, they are nondifferent from the
cause. In the Īśopaniṣad it is said that everything is related to the Supreme
Brahman or Kṛṣṇa, and thus everything belongs to Him only. One who knows
perfectly well that everything belongs to Kṛṣṇa, that He is the proprietor of
everything and that, therefore, everything is engaged in the service of the
Lord, naturally has nothing to do with the results of his activities, whether
virtuous or sinful. Even one’s material body, being a gift of the Lord for
carrying out a particular type of action, can be engaged in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.
It is beyond contamination by sinful reactions, exactly as the lotus leaf,
though remaining in the water, is not wet. The Lord also says in the Gītā: mayi
sarvāṇi karmāṇi sannyasya: “Resign all works unto Me [Kṛṣṇa].” The conclusion is
that a person without Kṛṣṇa consciousness acts according to the concept of the
material body and senses, but a person in Kṛṣṇa consciousness acts according to
the knowledge that the body is the property of Kṛṣṇa and should therefore be
engaged in the service of Kṛṣṇa.</p>

<p>The yogīs, abandoning attachment, act with body, mind, intelligence, and even

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>By acting in Kṛṣṇa consciousness for the satisfaction of the senses of Kṛṣṇa,
any action, whether of the body, mind, intelligence or even of the senses, is
purified of material contamination. There are no material reactions resulting
from the activities of a Kṛṣṇa conscious person. Therefore, purified activities,
which are generally called sadācāra, can be easily performed by acting in Kṛṣṇa
consciousness. Śrī Rūpa Gosvāmī in his Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu describes this as
follows:</p>
<p>īhā yasya harer dāsye karmaṇā manasā girā nikhilāsv apy avasthāsu jīvanmuktaḥ sa
ucyate</p>
<p>A person acting in Kṛṣṇa consciousness (or, in other words, in the service of
Kṛṣṇa) with his body, mind, intelligence and words is a liberated person even
within the material world, although he may be engaged in many so-called material
activities. He has no false ego, nor does he believe that he is this material
body, nor that he possesses the body. He knows that he is not this body and that
this body does not belong to him. He himself belongs to Kṛṣṇa, and the body too
belongs to Kṛṣṇa. When he applies everything produced of the body, mind,
intelligence, words, life, wealth, etc.—whatever he may have within his
possession—to Kṛṣṇa’s service, he is at once dovetailed with Kṛṣṇa. He is one
with Kṛṣṇa and is devoid of the false ego that leads one to believe that he is
the body, etc. This is the perfect stage of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The steadily devoted soul attains unadulterated peace because he offers the

Divine, who is greedy for the fruits of his labor, becomes entangled.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The difference between a person in Kṛṣṇa consciousness and a person in bodily
consciousness is that the former is attached to Kṛṣṇa, whereas the latter is
attached to the results of his activities. The person who is attached to Kṛṣṇa
and works for Him only is certainly a liberated person, and he is not anxious
for fruitive rewards. In the Bhāgavatam, the cause of anxiety over the result of
an activity is explained as being due to one’s functioning in the conception of
duality, that is, without knowledge of the Absolute Truth. Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme
Absolute Truth, the Personality of Godhead. In Kṛṣṇa consciousness, there is no
duality. All that exists is a product of Kṛṣṇa’s energy, and Kṛṣṇa is all good.
Therefore, activities in Kṛṣṇa consciousness are on the absolute plane; they are
transcendental and have no material effect. One is, therefore, filled with peace
in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. One who is, however, entangled in profit calculation for
sense gratification cannot have that peace. This is the secret of Kṛṣṇa
consciousness—realization that there is no existence besides Kṛṣṇa is the
platform of peace and fearlessness.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>When the embodied living being controls his nature and mentally renounces all
actions, he resides happily in the city of nine gates [the material body],
neither working nor causing work to be done.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The embodied soul lives in the city of nine gates. The activities of the body,
or the figurative city of body, are conducted automatically by the particular
modes of nature. The soul, although subjecting himself to the conditions of the
body, can be beyond those conditions, if he so desires. Owing only to
forgetfulness of his superior nature, he identifies with the material body, and
therefore suffers. By Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he can revive his real position and
thus come out of his embodiment. Therefore, when one takes to Kṛṣṇa
consciousness, one at once becomes completely aloof from bodily activities. In
such a controlled life, in which his deliberations are changed, he lives happily
within the city of nine gates. The nine gates are described as follows:</p>
<p>nava-dvāre pure dehī haṁso lelāyate bahiḥ vaśī sarvasya lokasya sthāvarasya
carasya ca.</p>
<p>“The Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is living within the body of a living
entity, is the controller of all living entities all over the universe. The body
consists of nine gates: two eyes, two nostrils, two ears, one mouth, the anus
and the genital. The living entity in his conditioned stage identifies himself
with the body, but when he identifies himself with the Lord within himself, he
becomes just as free as the Lord, even while in the body.” (Śvet. 3.18)</p>
<p>Therefore, a Kṛṣṇa conscious person is free from both the outer and inner
activities of the material body.</p>

this is enacted by the modes of material nature.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The living entity, as will be explained in the Seventh Chapter, is one in nature
with the Supreme Lord, distinguished from matter, which is another nature—called
inferior—of the Lord. Somehow, the superior nature, the living entity, has been
in contact with material nature since time immemorial. The temporary body or
material dwelling place which he obtains is the cause of varieties of activities
and their resultant reactions. Living in such a conditional atmosphere, one
suffers the results of the activities of the body by identifying himself (in
ignorance) with the body. It is ignorance acquired from time immemorial that is
the cause of bodily suffering and distress. As soon as the living entity becomes
aloof from the activities of the body, he becomes free from the reactions as
well. As long as he is in the city of body, he appears to be the master of it,
but actually he is neither its proprietor nor controller of its actions and
reactions. He is simply in the midst of the material ocean, struggling for
existence. The waves of the ocean are tossing him, and he has no control over
them. His best solution is to get out of the water by transcendental Kṛṣṇa
consciousness. That alone will save him from all turmoil.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Nor does the Supreme Spirit assume anyone’s sinful or pious activities. Embodied
beings, however, are bewildered because of the ignorance which covers their real
knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Sanskrit word vibhuḥ means the Supreme Lord who is full of unlimited
knowledge, riches, strength, fame, beauty and renunciation. He is always
satisfied in Himself, undisturbed by sinful or pious activities. He does not
create a particular situation for any living entity, but the living entity,
bewildered by ignorance, desires to be put into certain conditions of life, and
thereby his chain of action and reaction begins. A living entity is, by superior
nature, full of knowledge. Nevertheless, he is prone to be influenced by
ignorance due to his limited power. The Lord is omnipotent, but the living
entity is not. The Lord is vibhu, or omniscient, but the living entity is aṇu,
or atomic. Because he is a living soul, he has the capacity to desire by his
free will. Such desire is fulfilled only by the omnipotent Lord. And so, when
the living entity is bewildered in his desires, the Lord allows him to fulfill
those desires, but the Lord is never responsible for the actions and reactions
of the particular situation which may be desired. Being in a bewildered
condition, therefore, the embodied soul identifies himself with the
circumstantial material body and becomes subjected to the temporary misery and
happiness of life. The Lord is the constant companion of the living entity as
Paramātmā, or the Supersoul, and therefore He can understand the desires of the
individual soul, as one can smell the flavor of a flower by being near it.
Desire is a subtle form of conditioning of the living entity. The Lord fulfills
his desire as he deserves: Man proposes and God disposes. The individual is not,
therefore, omnipotent in fulfilling his desires. The Lord, however, can fulfill
all desires, and the Lord, being neutral to everyone, does not interfere with
the desires of the minute independant living entities. However, when one desires
Kṛṣṇa, the Lord takes special care and encourages one to desire in such a way
that one can attain to Him and be eternally happy. The Vedic hymn therefore
declares:</p>
<p>eṣa u hy eva sādhu karma kārayati taṁ yamebhyo lokebhya unninīṣate eṣa u
evāsādhu karma kārayati yamadho ninīṣate.</p>
<p>ajño jantur anīso ’yam ātmanaḥ sukha-duḥkhayoḥ īśvara-prerito gacchet svargaṁ
vāśvabhram eva ca.</p>
<p>“The Lord engages the living entity in pious activities so he may be elevated.
The Lord engages him in impious activities so he may go to hell. The living
entity is completely dependant in his distress and happiness. By the will of the
Supreme he can go to heaven or hell, as a cloud is driven by the air.”</p>
<p>Therefore the embodied soul, by his immemorial desire to avoid Kṛṣṇa
consciousness, causes his own bewilderment. Consequently, although he is
constitutionally eternal, blissful and cognizant, due to the littleness of his
existence he forgets his constitutional position of service to the Lord and is
thus entrapped by nescience. And, under the spell of ignorance, the living
entity claims that the Lord is responsible for his conditional existence. The
Vedānta-sūtras also confirm this:</p>
<p>vaiṣamya-nairghṛṇye na sāpekṣatvāt tathā hi darśayati.</p>
<p>“The Lord neither hates nor likes anyone, though He appears to.”</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>When, however, one is enlightened with the knowledge by which nescience is
destroyed, then his knowledge reveals everything, as the sun lights up
everything in the daytime.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Those who have forgotten Kṛṣṇa must certainly be bewildered, but those who are
in Kṛṣṇa consciousness are not bewildered at all. It is stated in the
Bhagavad-gītā, “sarvaṁ jñāna-plavena,” “jñānāgniḥ sarva-karmāṇi” and “na hi
jñānena sadṛśam.” Knowledge is always highly esteemed. And what is that
knowledge? Perfect knowledge is achieved when one surrenders unto Kṛṣṇa, as is
said in the Seventh Chapter, 19th verse: bahūnāṁ janmanām ante jñānavān māṁ
prapadyate. After passing through many, many births, when one perfect in
knowledge surrenders unto Kṛṣṇa, or when one attains Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then
everything is revealed to him, as the sun reveals everything in the daytime. The
living entity is bewildered in so many ways. For instance, when he thinks
himself God, unceremoniously, he actually falls into the last snare of
nescience. If a living entity is God, then how can he become bewildered by
nescience? Does God become bewildered by nescience? If so, then nescience, or
Satan, is greater than God. Real knowledge can be obtained from a person who is
in perfect Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Therefore, one has to seek out such a bona fide
spiritual master and, under him, learn what Kṛṣṇa consciousness is. The
spiritual master can drive away all nescience, as the sun drives away darkness.
Even though a person may be in full knowledge that he is not this body but is
transcendental to the body, he still may not be able to discriminate between the
soul and the Supersoul. However, he can know everything well if he cares to take
shelter of the perfect, bona fide Kṛṣṇa conscious spiritual master. One can know
God and one’s relationship with God only when one actually meets a
representative of God. A representative of God never claims that he is God,
although he is paid all the respect ordinarily paid to God because he has
knowledge of God. One has to learn the distinction between God and the living
entity. Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa therefore stated in the Second Chapter (2.12) that every
living being is individual and that the Lord also is individual. They were all
individuals in the past, they are individuals at present, and they will continue
to be individuals in the future, even after liberation. At night we see
everything as one in the darkness, but in day when the sun is up, we see
everything in its real identity. Identity with individuality in spiritual life
is real knowledge.</p>

<p>When one’s intelligence, mind, faith and refuge are all fixed in the Supreme,
then one becomes fully cleansed of misgivings through complete knowledge and

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Transcendental Truth is Lord Kṛṣṇa. The whole Bhagavad-gītā centers
around the declaration of Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That is
the version of all Vedic literature. Paratattva means the Supreme Reality, who
is understood by the knowers of the Supreme as Brahman, Paramātmā and Bhagavān.
Bhagavān, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the last word in the
Absolute. There is nothing more than that.TheLord says, mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat
kiñcit asti dhanañjaya. Impersonal Brahman is also supported by Kṛṣṇa: brahmaṇo
pratiṣṭhāham. Therefore in all ways Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Reality. One whose
mind, intelligence, faith and refuge are always in Kṛṣṇa, or, in other words,
one who is fully in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, is undoubtedly washed clean of all
misgivings and is in perfect knowledge in everything concerning transcendence. A
Kṛṣṇa conscious person can thoroughly understand that there is duality
(simultaneous identity and individuality) in Kṛṣṇa, and, equipped with such
transcendental knowledge, one can make steady progress on the path of
liberation.</p>

<p>A Kṛṣṇa conscious person does not make any distinction between species or
castes. The brāhmaṇa and the outcaste may be different from the social point of
view, or a dog, a cow, or an elephant may be different from the point of view of
species, but these differences of body are meaningless from the viewpoint of a
learned transcendentalist. This is due to their relationship to the Supreme, for
the Supreme Lord, by His plenary portion as Paramātmā, is present in everyone’s
heart. Such an understanding of the Supreme is real knowledge. As far as the
bodies are concerned in different castes or different species of life, the Lord
is equally kind to everyone because He treats every living being as a friend yet
maintains Himself as Paramātmā regardless of the circumstances of the living
entities. The Lord as Paramātmā is present both in the outcaste and in the
brāhmaṇa, although the body of a brāhmaṇa and that of an outcaste are not the
same. The bodies are material productions of different modes of material nature,
but the soul and the Supersoul within the body are of the same spiritual
quality. The similarity in the quality of the soul and the Supersoul, however,
does not make them equal in quantity, for the individual soul is present only in
that particular body, whereas the Paramātmā is present in each and every body. A
Kṛṣṇa conscious person has full knowledge of this, and therefore he is truly
learned and has equal vision. The similar characteristics of the soul and
Supersoul are that they are both conscious, eternal and blissful. But the
difference is that the individual soul is conscious within the limited
jurisdiction of the body, whereas the Supersoul is conscious of all bodies. The
Supersoul is present in all bodies without distinction.</p>

death. The Lord is flawless because He is without attraction or hatred.

<p>The symptoms of the self-realized person are given herein. The first symptom is
that he is not illusioned by the false identification of the body with his true
self. He knows perfectly well that he is not this body, but is the fragmental
port~on of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is therefore not joyful in
achieving something, nor does he lament in losing anything which is related to
his body. This steadiness of mind is called sthira-buddhi, or self-intelligence.
He is therefore never bewildered by mistaking the gross body for the soul, nor
does he accept the body as permanent and disregard the existence of the soul.
This knowledge elevates him to the station of knowing the complete science of
the Absolute Truth, namely Brahman, Paramātmā and Bhagavān. He thus knows his
constitutional position perfectly well, without falsely trying to become one
with the Supreme in all respects. This is called Brahman realization, or
self-realization. Such steady consciousness is called Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</p>

his taste for material sense pleasure altogether. The highest pleasure in terms
of matter is sex pleasure. The whole world is moving under its spell, and a
materialist cannot work at all without this motivation. But a person engaged in
Kṛṣṇa consciousness can work with greater vigor without sex pleasure, which he
avoids. That is the test in spiritual realization. Spiritual realization and sex
pleasure go ill together. A Kṛṣṇa conscious person is not attracted to any kind
of sense pleasure due to his being a liberated soul.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Material sense pleasures are due to the contact of the material senses, which
are all temporary because the body itself is temporary. A liberated soul is not
interested in anything which is temporary. Knowing well the joys of
transcendental pleasures, how can a liberated soul agree to enjoy false
pleasure? In the Padma Purāṇa it is said:</p>
<p>ramante yogino ’nante satyānanda-cid-ātmani iti rāma-padenāsau paraṁ
brahmābhidhīyate</p>
<p>“The mystics derive unlimited transcendental pleasures from the Absolute Truth,
and therefore the Supreme Absolute Truth, the Personality of Godhead, is also
known as Rāma.”</p>
<p>In the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam also it is said:</p>
<p>nāyaṁ deho deha-bhājāṁ nṛ-loke kaṣṭān kāmān arhate viḍ-bhajāṁ ye tapo divyaṁ
putrakā yena sattvaṁ śuddhyed yasmād brahma-saukhyaṁ tv anantam.</p>
<p>“My dear sons, there is no reason to labor very hard for sense pleasure while in
this human form of life; such pleasures are available to the stool-eaters
[hogs]. Rather, you should undergo penances in this life by which your existence
will be purified, and, as a result, you will be able to enjoy unlimited
transcendental bliss.” (Bhāg. 5.5.1)</p>
<p>Therefore, those who are true yogīs or learned transcendentalists are not
attracted by sense pleasures, which are the causes of continuous material
existence. The more one is addicted to material pleasures, the more he is
entrapped by material miseries.</p>

different senses, and the mind, is called gosvāmī, or svāmī. Such gosvāmīs live
strictly controlled lives, and forego altogether the forces of the senses.

chest become agitated. Therefore, one must practice to control them before one

brahma-bhūta, attaining which one is assured of going back to Godhead, back to
home.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>One who is beyond duality and doubt, whose mind is engaged within, who is always
busy working for the welfare of all sentient beings, and who is free from all
sins, achieves liberation in the Supreme.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Only a person who is fully in Kṛṣṇa consciousness can be said to be engaged in
welfare work for all living entities. When a person is actually in the knowledge
that Kṛṣṇa is the fountainhead of everything, then when he acts in that spirit
he acts for everyone. The sufferings of humanity are due to forgetfulness of
Kṛṣṇa as the supreme enjoyer, the supreme proprietor, and the supreme friend.
Therefore, to act to revive this consciousness within the entire human society
is the highest welfare work. One cannot be engaged in first-class welfare work
without being liberated in the Supreme. A Kṛṣṇa conscious person has no doubt
about the supremacy of Kṛṣṇa. He has no doubt because he is completely freed
from all sins. This is the state of divine love.</p>
<p>A person engaged only in ministering to the physical welfare of human society
cannot factually help anyone. Temporary relief of the external body and the mind
is not satisfactory. The real cause of one’s difficulties in the hard struggle
for life may be found in one’s forgetfulness of his relationship with the
Supreme Lord. When a man is fully conscious of his relationship with Kṛṣṇa, he
is actually a liberated soul, although he may be in the material tabernacle.</p>

<p>Those who are free from anger and all material desires, who are selfrealized,
self-disciplined and constantly endeavoring for perfection, are assured of
liberation in the Supreme in the very near future.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Of the saintly persons who are constantly engaged in striving toward salvation,
one who is in Kṛṣṇa consciousness is the best of all. The Bhāgavatam confirms
this fact as follows:</p>
<p>yat-pāda-paṅkaja-palāśa-vilāsa-bhaktyā karmāśayaṁ grathitam udgrathayanti santaḥ
tadvan na rikta-matayo yatayo ’pi ruddha- srotogaṇās tam araṇaṁ bhaja vāsudevam.</p>
<p>“Just try to worship, in devotional service, Vāsudeva, the Supreme Personality
of Godhead. Even great sages are not able to control the forces of the senses as
effectively as those who are engaged in transcendental bliss by serving the
lotus feet of the Lord, uprooting the deep grown desire for fruitive
activities.” (Bhāg. 4.22.39)</p>
<p>In the conditioned soul the desire to enjoy the fruitive results of work is so
deep-rooted that it is very difficult even for the great sages to control such
desires, despite great endeavors. A devotee of the Lord, constantly engaged in
devotional service in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, perfect in self-realization, very
quickly attains liberation in the Supreme. Owing to his complete knowledge in
self-realization, he always remains in trance. To cite an analagous example of
this:</p>
<p>darśana-dhyāna-saṁsparśair matsya-kūrma-vihaṅgamāḥ svānya patyāni puṣṇanti
tathāham api padmaja.</p>
<p>“By vision, by meditation and by touch only do the fish, the tortoise and the
birds maintain their offspring. Similarly do I also, O Padmaja!”</p>
<p>The fish brings up its offspring simply by looking at them. The tortoise brings
up its offspring simply by meditation. The eggs of the tortoise are laid on
land, and the tortoise meditates on the eggs while in the water. Similarly, a
devotee in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, although far away from the Lord’s abode, can
elevate himself to that abode simply by thinking of Him constantly—by engagement
in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. He does not feel the pangs of material miseries; this
state of life is called brahma-nirvāṇa, or the absence of material miseries due
to being constantly immersed in the Supreme.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Shutting out all external sense objects, keeping the eyes and vision
concentrated between the two eyebrows, suspending the inward and outward breaths
within the nostrils—thus controlling the mind, senses and intelligence, the
tranecendentalist becomes free from desire, fear and anger. One who is always in
this state is certainly liberated.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Being engaged in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, one can immediately understand one’s
spiritual identity, and then one can understand the Supreme Lord by means of
devotional service. When he is well situated in devotional service, one comes to
the transcendental position, qualified to feel the presence of the Lord in the
sphere of one’s activity. This particular position is called liberation in the
Supreme.</p>
<p>After explaining the above principles of liberation in the Supreme, the Lord
gives instruction to Arjuna as to how one can come to that position by the
practice of mysticism or yoga, known as aṣṭāṅga-yoga, which is divisible into an
eightfold procedure called yama, niyama, āsana, prāṇāyāma, pratyāhāra, dhāraṇā,
dhyāna, and samādhi. In the Sixth Chapter the subject of yoga is explicitly
detailed, and at the end of the Fifth it is only preliminarily explained. One
has to drive out the sense objects such as sound, touch, form, taste and smell
by the pratyāhāra (breathing) process in yoga, and then keep the vision of the
eyes between the two eyebrows and concentrate on the tip of the nose with half
closed lids. There is no benefit in closing the eyes altogether, because then
there is every chance of falling asleep. Nor is there benefit in opening the
eyes completely, because then there is the hazard of being attracted by sense
objects. The breathing movement is restrained within the nostrils by
neutralizing the up- and down-moving air within the body. By practice of such
yoga one is able to gain control over the senses, refrain from outward sense
objects, and thus prepare oneself for liberation in the Supreme.</p>
<p>This yoga process helps one become free from all kinds of fear and anger and
thus feel the presence of the Supersoul in the transcendental situation. In
other words, Kṛṣṇa consciousness is the easiest process of executing yoga
principles. This will be thoroughly explained in the next chapter. A Kṛṣṇa
conscious person, however, being always engaged in devotional service, does not
risk losing his senses to some other engagement. This is a better way of
controlling the senses than by the aṣṭāṅga-yoga.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The sages, knowing Me as the ultimate purpose of all sacrifices and austerities,
the Supreme Lord of all planets and demigods and the benefactor and well-wisher
of all living entities, attain peace from the pangs of material miseries.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The conditioned souls within the clutches of illusory energy are all anxious to
attain peace in the material world. But they do not know the formula for peace,
which is explained in this part of the Bhagavad-gītā. The greatest peace formula
is simply this: Lord Kṛṣṇa is the beneficiary in all human activities. Men
should offer everything to the transcendental service of the Lord because He is
the proprietor of all planets and the demigods thereon. No one is greater than
He. He is greater than the greatest of the demigods, Lord Śiva and Lord Brahmā.
In the Vedas the Supreme Lord is described as tam īśvarāṇāṁ paramaṁ maheśvaram.
Under the spell of illusion, living entities are trying to be lords of all they
survey, but actually they are dominated by the material energy of the Lord. The
Lord is the master of material nature, and the conditioned souls are under the
stringent rules of material nature. Unless one understands these bare facts, it
is not possible to achieve peace in the world either individually or
collectively. This is the sense of Kssna consciousness: Lord Kṛṣṇa is the
supreme predominator, and all living entities, including the great demigods, are
His subordinates. One can attain perfect peace only in complete Kṛṣṇa
consciousness.</p>
<p>This Fifth Chapter is a practical explanation of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, generally
known as karma-yoga. The question of mental speculation as to how karma-yoga can
give liberation is answered herewith. To work in Kṛṣṇa consciousness is to work
with the complete knowledge of the Lord as the predominator. Such work is not
different from transcendental knowledge. Direct Kṛṣṇa consciousness is
bhakti-yoga, and jñāna-yoga is a path leading to bhakti-yoga. Kṛṣṇa
consciousness means to work in full knowledge of one’s relationship with the
Supreme Absolute, and the perfection of this consciousness is full knowledge of
Kṛṣṇa, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead. A pure soul is the eternal servant
of God as His fragmental part and parcel. He comes into contact with māyā
(illusion) due to the desire to lord it over māyā, and that is the cause of his
many sufferings. As long as he is in contact with matter, he has to execute work
in terms of material necessities. Kṛṣṇa consciousness, however, brings one into
spiritual life even while one is within the jurisdiction of matter, for it is an
arousing of spiritual existence by practice in the material world. The more one
is advanced, the more he is freed from the clutches of matter. The Lord is not
partial toward anyone. Everything depends on one’s practical performance of
duties in an effort to control the senses and conquer the influence of desire
and anger. And, attaining Kṛṣṇa consciousness by controlling the above-mentioned
passions, one remains factually in the transcendental stage, or brahman-nirvāṇa.
The eightfold yoga mysticism is automatically practiced in Kṛṣṇa consciousness
because the ultimate purpose is served. There is gradual process of elevation in
the practice of yama, niyama, āsana, pratyāhāra, dhyāna, dhāraṇā, prāṇāyāma, and
samādhi. But these only preface perfection by devotional service, which alone
can award peace to the human being. It is the highest perfection of life.</p>
